bright side somewhereNow the prodigal son was a forward child His mind was not to obey But after he left his father's house He thought he had gone astray That's why I believe that, I believe that I will go back home Yes, I believe that, I believe that I will go back home I believe that, I believe that I will go back home And be a servant of the Lord Now his father saw him coming And he met him with a smile He threw his arms around him Saying this is my darling child I believe that, I believe that I will go back home Yes, I believe that, I believe that I will go back home I believe that, I believe that I will go back home And be a servant of the Lord Now the father asked the prodigal Son, why you been gone so long What made you so love the world And forget your happy home The prodigal

bright And he says in a little while you'll be all right All he gives is a humbug pill A dose of dope and a great big bill Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live Well there once was a time when everything was cheap But now prices nearly puts a man to sleep When we get our grocery bill We just feel like making our will Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live Prohibition's good if 'tis conducted right There's no sense in shooting a man 'til he shows flight Officers kill without a cause Then they complain about the funny laws Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live I remember when dry goods were cheap as dirt We could take two bits and buy a dandy shirt Now we pay ten bucks or more Maybe get a shirt that another man wore Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live Down in Mississippi Down in Mississippi Down in Mississippi where I was born Down in Mississippi where I come from Way down As far back as I can remember I either had to plow or hoe One of them long ol’ nine feet sacks Standin’ at the old turn row Down in Mississippi Down in Mississippi Down in Mississippi where I was born Down in Mississippi where I come from Way down Nothin' I got against Mississippi It also was the home of my wife But I feel just like a lucky man To get away with my life Down in Mississippi Down in Mississippi Down in Mississippi where I was born Down in Mississippi where I come from Way downComin' in on a wing and a prayer Comin' in on a wing and a prayer With our one motor gone We can still carry on Comin' in on a wing and a prayer What a show, what a fight Boys, we really hit our target for tonight How we sing as we limp through the air Look below, there's our field over there With our one motor gone We can still carry on Comin' in on a wing and a prayer Comin' in on a wing and a prayer Comin' in on a wing and a prayer With our full crew on board And our trust in the Lord We're comin' in on a wing and a prayerThere's a place where I've been told Every street is paved with gold And it's just across the borderline And when it's time to take your turn Here's a lesson that you must learn You could lose more than you'll ever hope to find When you reach the broken promised land And every dream slips through your hands Then you'll know that it's too late to change your mind'Cause you've paid the price to come so far Just to wind up where you are And you're still just across the borderline Up and down the Rio Grande A thousand footprints in the sand Reveal a secret no one can define The river flows on like a breath In between our life and death Tell me, who's the next to cross the borderline En la triste oscuridad Hoy tenemos que cruzar Este río que nos llama más allá But hope remains when pride is gone And it keeps you moving on Calling you across the borderlineIf your man's got you on the run Why don't you try me If you wanna have a little fun Oh baby, why don't you try me If you tote more than you can bear If your troubles been more than your share And if things are not going just right Why don't you try a man like me tonight Why don't you try me tonight Why don't you try me Why don't you try me tonight Why don't you try me Last night while I was trying to sleep I heard a racket from the room next door, hmm And that was you and your man havin' a fight Like you've done so many nights

met a girl from Texas 'bout a year ago Hadn't known her for too long when I had to let her go You see, she had a razor, was ten inches or so And every night you'd hear her knocking at my door She said, "Baby, I'll give you the clothes off my back You can have everything that I've got in my shack But if you ever try to leave they'll take you out in a sack'Cause me and my razor will see to that"That's the way the girls are from Texas That's the way the girls are from Texas That's the way the girls are from Texas I thought about my situation, decided not to tarry For my own self preservation I decided we should marry When the preacher started reading 'bout 'till death do us part I told him, "Skip it, she had that understanding right from the start"She said, "Baby, I'll give you the clothes off my back You can have everything that I've got in my shack But if you ever try to leave they'll take you out in a sack'Cause me and my razor will see to that"That's the way the girls are from Texas That's the way the girls are from Texas That's the way the girls are from Texas Yeah that's the way the girls are from TexasCome and gather all around me Listen to my tale of woe Got some good advice to give you Lots of things you oughta know Take a tip from one who's travelled And never stopped a-ramblin' 'round'Cause once you get the roamin' fever You never want to settle

knew it was the Red Ball Train And I left that gal beside the railroad And never saw that gal again, boy I never saw that gal again Saw that gal again I never saw that gal again Left that gal beside

living on Straight Street now I moved, I had to move, I'm living on Straight Street now Before I moved over, let me tell you how it was with me Old Satan had me bound in chains and I had no liberty One day my heart got troubled all about my dwelling place I heard the Lord when He spoke to me, and he told me to leave that place So I moved, I moved and I'm living on Straight Street now Yes I moved, I move, well I'm living on Straight Street now Since I moved, I'm really living, I've got peace within I thank the Lord for everything, so glad I found new friends So I moved, I moved and I'm living on Straight Street now I moved, I had to move, and I'm living on Straight Street now
