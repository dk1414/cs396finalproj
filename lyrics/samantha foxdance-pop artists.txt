Ah, touch me, touch me This is the night Touch me, touch me I wanna feel your body Full moon in the city and the night was young I was hungry for love, I was hungry for fun I was hunting you down, and I was the bait When I saw you there, I didn't need to hesitate This is the night, this is the night This is the time we've got to get it right Touch me, touch me I wanna feel your body Your heartbeat next to mine Touch me, touch me now Quick as a flash, you disappeared into the night Did I hurt you boy  Didn't I treat you right You made me feel so good, made me feel myself Now I'm alone and you're with somebody else This is the night, this is the night This is the time we've got to get it right Maybe Just maybe Naughty girls need love too I've been told time and time again That you can't treat love like a game But I play rough with hearts that never mend'Cause some guys like you do the same Love was just a four letter word Never heard, how absurd How it could be Now, I can't believe this is real How I feel, now you steal My heart away from me Used to be so good and so bad Sex was just something I had Used to always know what to do Now you've got me confused Baby, don't let me be misunderstood But it feels so good Then along came you, now I know it's true Naughty girls need love tooI don't know what it is That makes me love you so I only know I never want to let you go Cause you started something Can`t you see That ever since we've met You`ve had a hold on me It happens to be true I only wanna be with you It doesn't matter Where you go or what you do I`d love to spend each moment Of the day with you Look what has happened Just one kiss I never knew that I could be in love like this It`s crazy But it`s true I only wanna be with youNothing`s gonna stop me now Nothing`s gonna stop me now There was a time I couldn't get you out of my mind And since the day you came You tried to take control of me Then came the day I thought about running away And now my bags are packed Don't even think of holding me back Nothing's gonna stop me now And I don`t wanna talk it over I said nothing`s gonna stop me now Gonna break it up Gonna take my love away Yeah, yeah Day after day I started slipping away You took my self respect And you made a fool of meHello, it's me again Don't you know It's hard to keep a good woman down But then again, maybe that could be fun Sa-Sa-Sa-Sa-Samantha Fox Ain't it funny how when I say let's go out You're always saying someone else will get me What's a girl to do  I like to have fun too But you're so jealous, you never let me leave So how come you can leave But when it comes to me Always something I must prove  You know I love you, always thinking of you But tonight, I've got to make that move I wanna have some fun Move my body all night long I wanna have some fun Move my body all night long To the spirit of the night, I surrender I got a secret I can't keep That burns inside when I'm in my sleep I try to hide from your memory But you come back and it's haunting me What will I find in this fantasy If I go with you now, will you set me free  And I surrender to the spirit of the night I surrender The darkness is my lover, and that's a pleasure So I surrender to the spirit of the night I take cover from the light of day But you keep calling and I obey I don't remember where I have been But you come back to me in my dreamsHe's got all you could ever want He's got the purpose and the style He's got such an open mind He's got the walk you'd never find He's got the roughness in his voice He's got...my one and only choice He's got a sweet and tender voice He's got...but most of all he's got Sex on his mind Seems to me he wants sex all the time I can't believe the way his heart rules his mind And when he wants it he gets sex all the time He's got a taste for everything He gives the kind of state the morning brings He's got his never ending love for me He gives what your dreams cause in the night He's got the kind of love that makes you blind He gives attention to your tender spots He's got...Hot!Sex on his mind Seems to me he wants sex all the time I can't believe the way his heart rules his mind And when he wants it he gets sex all the timeAre you strong enough Give me what I wants Can you please me Right now  Are you strong enough Give me what I wants Can you please me Right now  Come on!So

do ya wanna please me Do ya, do ya wanna please me Do ya, do ya wanna please Please me now, woah-oh-ohWe started out right, ended up wrong For one another babe When life is too short, we leave it too long To find each other babe I don't know, I don't know Just how we got this way Inside this breaking heart The pieces fall apart And all I'm dreaming of My true devotion I don't remember when The pleasure turned to pain Just want you back again My true devotion Yesterday's dreams like old magazines They lie beside the bed The hurting inside, that old foolish pride The things we never said Sorry now; funny how we bite the hand that feeds Turn out the light, say goodnight Time to draw the blinds Missing you, who's kidding who We can't go on this wayI've got a secret nobody knows I don't want to keep it but I can't let it go I've tried to tell you so many times But I could never tell you, baby, what I feel inside Baby I'm lost for words when I see you everyday I try to make myself heard but you take my breath away I get tongue-tied, shy, hands are shaking Speechless, heart slowly breaking Oh oh baby I'm lost for words Brown eyes & blue skies playing on my mind How long must I go on keeping my feelings inside Love is a lonely game unless there are two How long must I go on living, living without you Baby I'm lost for words There is nothing I can say I try to make myself heard but you take my breath away Shut down when communication breaks down in conversation Oh oh baby I'm lost for words Love is a lonely game unless there are two How long must I go on living, living without you
