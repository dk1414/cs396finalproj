Follow that dollar for a long way down Far away from the poorhouse door Either get to hell or to Hadestown Ain’t no difference anymore!Way down Hadestown Way down under the ground Hound dog howl and the whistle blow Train comes a-rollin, clickety-clack Nobody knows where that old train goes Those who go they don’t come back Way down Hadestown Way down under the ground Winter’s nigh and summer’s o’er I hear that high and lonesome sound Of my husband coming for To bring me home to Hadestown Way down Hadestown Way down under the ground Everybody dresses in clothes so fine Everybody’s pockets are weighted down Everybody sipping ambrosia wine In a goldmine in Hadestown Way down Hadestown Way down under the groundLover, tell me, if you can Who’s gonna buy the wedding bands Times being what they are Hard, and getting harder all the time Lover, when I sing my song All the rivers sing along And they’re gonna break their banks for me To lay their gold around my feet All a-flashing in the pan All to fashion for your hand The rivers are gonna give us the wedding band Lover, tell me, if you’re able Who’s gonna lay the wedding table Times being what they are Dark, and getting darker all the time Lover, when I sing my song All the trees are gonna sing along And bend their branches down to me To lay their fruit around my feet The almond and the apple And the sugar from the maple The trees gonna lay the wedding tableHey, little songbird, give me a song I’m a busy man and I can’t stay long I got clients to call, I got orders to fill I got walls to build, I got riots to quell And they’re giving me hell back in Hades Hey, little songbird, cat got your tongue Always a pity for one so pretty and young When poverty comes to clip your wings And knock the wind right out of your lungs Hey, nobody sings on empty Strange is the call of this strange man I want to fly down and feed at his hand I want a nice soft place to land I wanna lie down forever Hey, little songbird, you got something fine You’d shine like a diamond down in the mine And the choice is yours if you’re willing to choose Seeing as you’ve got nothing to lose And I could use a canary Suddenly nothing is as it was Where are you now, Orpheus Wasn’t it always the two of us Weren’t we birds of a feather Hades, my husband, Hades, my light Hades, my darkness If you had heard how he sang tonight You’d pity poor Orpheus!All of his sorrow won’t fit in his chest It just burns like a fire in the pit of his chest And his heart is a bird on a spit in his chest How long, how long, how long How long  Just as long as Hades is King Nothing comes of wishing on stars And nothing comes of the songs people sing However sorry they are Give them a piece and they’ll take it all Show them the crack and they’ll tear down the wall Lend them an ear and the Kingdom will fall The Kingdom will fall for a song What does he care for the logic of kings The laws of your underworld It is only for love that he sings!He sings for the love of a girl Why do we build the wall, my children, my children Why do we build the wall Why do we build the wall We build the wall to keep us free That’s why we build the wall We build the wall to keep us free How does the wall keep us free, my children, my children How does the wall keep us free How does the wall keep us free The wall keeps out the enemy And we build the wall to keep us free That’s why we build the wall We build the wall to keep us free Who do we call the enemy, my children, my children Who do we call the enemy Who do we call the enemy The enemy is poverty And the wall keeps out the enemy And we build the wall to keep us free That’s why we build the wall We build the wall to keep us freeMy mother gave a mighty shout Opened her legs and let me out Hungry as a

daddy's house is the safest of houses He sealed up the windows so no air gets in And there's plenty of Campbell's and beers in the basement In case we can't get to the store or something And my daddy told me some people hate us They even hate me, I'm just a kid So I asked how come, but he didn't answer So I started thinking it was something I did I have a bed with a Superman blanket And he's not afraid of the dark like me Sometimes I can't fall asleep when I'm supposed to I'm thinking about something I saw on T VThere was this house in a field full of houses It was the bad guys living in there And I saw this kid looking out from the window He didn't look bad, he only looked scaredWhen I think about dying I think about children And when I think about children I think about you And when I think about you I feel like crying Crying for my youth And when I think of my youth I think of my freedom And when I think of my freedom I feel so alone And when I feel lonely I want you to hold me Hold me in your arms And when I think of your arms I think about sleeping Sleeping like a baby All through the night And then I think of the night And I feel like weeping Weeping for my life
