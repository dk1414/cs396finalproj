You dig down underground now Through the soil, through the cooling clay As the din fades above you You're moving, you're secret, you're nowhere, it's all good And no lights lead you onwards And no signs point you on your way You're just earth in all directions It's endless, it's mapless, no compass, no North Star You're all gone cause they can't find you You're lost cause they don't know the way They blame themselves, they blame each other They're angry, they're sorry, they're worried, you don't care The shovels scrape somewhere up there They just want to know if you're okay You're morse code tapped with hammers You hear it, you know it, ignore it, you're on your way But at some point, oh, you've gotta come up for air You wipe the rocks and mud, and dirt out of your hair You're blind and queasy with a growing sense of despair You don't know anyone You look around, yeah, trying to find someone you know You put your hand up in the air, you kinda wave hello But if they do care, oh, they're not letting it show This can't be new to youI lost my membership card to the human race So don't forget the face'Cause I know that I do belong here Go down the checklist let's see, feelings are good Dishonesty is bad And keeping it inside is worse still You want a problem  Well, I guess we got one now I really don't know how There's injuns over every goddamn hill What do you want me to say What do you want me to do To let you know that I do mean it What do you want me to say What do you want me to do To let you know that I do mean it What do you want me to say, yeah, yeah I see it coming from a million miles away What else can I say The only way you know that I love you And there's no eye-to-eye, just Moses on the mount Or I'm in for the count You need your man above or below you I cannot cry at will but I do wish I could'Cause it'd do you some good When every joke I make is treason There was a time when you could make me laugh at will And you can do it still But never is it for the right reasons, yeahI got it in the mail one morning There was no return address Just my name in gold leaf on the front There was no time or location There was really no info at all No date no place no time no R SV PBut it said:You are invited By anyone to do anything You are invited for all time I didn’t think much about it It seemed like a really dumb joke But later that week it was Friday once again So I took it down to a disco That wouldn’t have me in a million years I flashed it once and I was inside with a drink I really didn’t stay too long there'Cause no one was having much fun I made my way to a party all the way across town It was thrown by the friend of an ex-thing I wasn’t sure if I should go But when I got in the place there were smiles all up and down I grabbed my ex in the kitchen I told her I was sorry I came But she looked at me with a glazed smile and said:Red wire - right temple Black wire - left temple Red wire - right temple Black wire - left temple Red wire - right temple Black wire - left temple Red wire - right temple Black wire - left temple There are times I think eternal life ain’t such a bad gig Smoke all you want and see the planets If and only if they find a way to cure the longing The distant panic Someday, I’m telling you They’ll make a memory machine To wax our hearts to a blinding sheen To wash away the grief Someday, I’m telling you They’ll make a memory machine To wax our hearts to a blinding sheen To wash away the griefIf I don't have s-s-s-s-s-s-sex by the end of the week, I'm g-g-going to die If I don't feel a p-p-p-p-pair of s-s-s-soft l-l-l-l-lips on my own, oh, I'm going to hang my head and cry If I don't feel w-w-w-warm breath on the n-n-n-nape of my n-n-n-n-neck or feel a nice post-coital sigh C'mon baby, now you can tell the cops why Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Woah-no no, woah-ho no no Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Woah-no no, woah-ho no no Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Woah-no no, woah-ho no no And ya don't kn-kn-kn-know th-th-th-the ice ice c-c-c-cold vice that grips my head And ya don't kn-kn-kn-know th-th-th-the burning, th-th-the burning I feel when I try to get out of bed And ya don't kn-kn-kn-know how these urges, all these urges, all these urges, all these urges can be so very very misread C'mon baby, now was it something I said Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Woah-no no, woah-ho no no Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Woah-no no, woah-ho no no Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Woah-no woah, woah-ho no noShe’s wearing too much lipstick tonight A little black dress a little too tight Tries to make small talk but it drips with spite She knows that he’s coming, it’s really all right Nobody here could know how she feels Not getting drunk and she hates wearing heels She tries to stand, but the room seems to bend and reel Her friends all keep asking why can’t she just deal If she spins fast enough then maybe the broken pieces of her heart will stay together But ain't no gyroscope can spin forever, yeah If she spins fast enough then maybe the broken pieces of her heart will stay together But ain't no gyroscope can spin forever He says it’s over and it’s such a release It’s finally happened and he’s making his peace All the reminders don’t bother him in the least The Jekyll and Hyde shit will finally cease His eyes on fire and his hands kind of shake Like his voice is ready to break You kind of wonder how long this boy’s been awake Or how much less sense one person can makeWell, now I notice the streetlamp's hum The ghosts of graffiti, they couldn't quite erase The blank-faced stares on the subway as people go home The parks lay empty like my unmade bed The streets are silent like my lifeless telephone And this is where I live, but I've never felt less at home So I'm not unsympathetic I see why you left There's no one to know There's nothing to do The city's been dead Since you've been gone Sometimes I stand on my roof at night And watch as something seems to happen somewhere else I feel like the breeze could pick me up and carry me away Out and over the iridescent grid Up and away from the bar fights and neon lights And out and away from everything that makes me what I am So I'm not unsympathetic I see why you left There's no one to know There's nothing to do The city's been dead Since you've been goneThe only thing worse than bad memories Is no memories at all From the age of 20 to 22 I had five friends None of whose names I can recall And as I would walk down K Street to some temping job As winter froze the life out of fall Yeah, I must’ve been having a ball, yeah Different scene outside your window now Same V CR, the same cats Different people at the very same job Similar alley, different rats The trash goes out on a Tuesday now You got to make a note about that Yeah, this time you’re where it’s at, yeah You can’t say it but I know that it’s in there You don’t know it but I know that you’re scared Obvious and lonely—a spider in the snow Now you find the very same pit still yawns Deep down within the very same gut The very same ghosts still seem to haunt you down Down those lines you always tried to cut You thought you just might need a little change And now you find you got nothing but How can a body move the speed of light And still find itself in such a rut There’s a kind of music that reminds me of you It’s all clear expensive drinks and shiny shirts And the click of heels as they descend from the taxi Like the first foot on the moon, oh, and it glows with ache And if it hits me right, oh, it’s almost too much to take And it’s got right angle laser razor thin lines That curve and swerve like perfect sines As we dress to the nines in an attempt to leave it all behind In a search of the moment between the seconds where Everything is just fine That silver thread embedded deep within our spines And I used to be kind of weird about this A fear of dependence on a guilty gilt-edged Hedged transcendence that makes us liars And tense the fear of looking down and seeing That nothing really suspends us But it was never just another Saturday night Not with you in attendance So put your hands in the air And wave them like you just don’t care It’s on a whim; it’s on a dare To shrug away what we can’t bear And we’re going back and forth and back and forth And back and forth and back We’re going back and forth and back and forth And back and forth and backOh, launched all the world's nukes this morning Hoping it would kick-start something Some of them went off course and hit the moon instead It was kinda pretty Well, there hasn't been a whole lot of looting On the other hand, oh, it's fucking freezing Someone on T V said something about going underground I guess we better start digging What were you doing for those eight and a half minutes Was it mean, was it petty, or did you realize you were sorry And that you love them What were you doing for those eight and a half minutes Was it mean, was it cruel, or did you realize you were sorry And that you love them Well, I saw an astronomer break down on C NN He said, "I'm a scientist, not your fucking clergyman!"And no one's going nowhere 'cause their cars are all frozen They give the power plants ten days The sky is like a dome of black metal flake And stars bleed together in phosphorescent lakes And a dead black disk slides silently overhead It's fucking beautiful is what it is
