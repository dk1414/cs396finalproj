How do you cool your lips, after a summer's kiss How do you rid the sweat, after the body bliss How do you turn your eyes from the romantic glare How do you block the sound of a voice you'd know anywhere Oh, I really should've known By the time you drove me home By the vagueness in your eyes Your casual goodbyes By the chill in your embrace The expression on your face That told me maybe you might have Some advice to give On how to be insensitive Insensitive Insensitive How do you numb the skin, after the warmest touch How do you slow your blood, after the body rush How do you free your soul after you've found a friend How do you teach your heart it's a crime to fall in love again You give your hand to me And then you say hello And I can hardly speak My heart is beating so And anyone can tell You think you know me well But you don't know me Mmmmm No you don't know the one Who dreams of you at night Who longs to kiss your lips Longs to hold you tight Oh I am just a friend That's all I've ever been Cause you don't know me I never knew the art of makin' love Though my heart aches with love for you Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by The chance that you might love me too You give your hand to me and then you say goodbye I watch you walk away beside the lucky girl Oh you will never know The one who loves you so Well, you don't know meCould I be your girl Hide your heart under the bed and lock your secret drawer Wash the angels from your head won't need them anymore Love is a demon and you're the one he's coming for Oh my Lord He's bringing sweet salvation, let temptation take you in He's every fear and every hope and every single sin He is the universe, the love you've been imagining Oh my Lord  oh my Lord And I am ashes, I am Jesus I am precious Could I be your girl Could I be your girl Put a chair against the door and turn the lights down low Write a letter to yourself, no one will ever know Tell them all about the girl who just refused to fall Oh my LordGot my suitcase Got my dog I'm packing up my life so far Got my pictures Got some cash I'm getting out of here at last Got my hands on the wheel, got my foot on the pedal Gonna drive til I drop, til the tires turn to metal Gonna sleep when I'm dead, gonna laugh like the devil Gonna find some place where no one knows me Gonna stop when the last drop of gas turns to vapor Gonna ride til I can't even seem to remember Who I was when I left and it don't even matter Gonna find some place where no one knows me Feel the sunburn on my skin I feel the wind whip through my grin Took the rear-view mirror down I wrapped it in my wedding gown Got my hands on the wheel, got my foot on the pedal Gonna drive til I drop, til the tires turn to metal Gonna sleep when I'm dead, gonna laugh like the devil Gonna find some place where no one knows meMany years ago on Christmas Day People came from all around to bow their heads and pray For on that lonely night a babe was born God gave us his only son that He may save the world And He taught us of compassion He taught us how to love He taught us to believe in God above Let know Him know that you are still alive Raise your hands up to the sky Get down on your knees and pray If only for one day Make it Christmas Day Jing-a-ling-a-long Ding Dong Jing-a-long Jing-a-ling-a-long Ding Dang Dong Jing Jing-a-ling Sing along Jing along

and dreaming of the things I'd do My brother lived for huffing gasoline And my mother would pray until her hands were blue That it was not true Was I ever thirteen Was I ever thirteen Was I  Was I  Was I Was I ever sixteen, thinking I'd be beautiful The boys were meticulously mean And I didn't have the wherewithal to find my truth Was I ever sеventeen, hoping for a tender kiss Thеy were never meant for girls like me I'd lie in bed and dream about the love I'd miss Was I ever thirteen Was I ever thirteen Was I  Was I  Was I Where do we go How do we get there How do we know the way the road

Feet on ground, heart in hand Facing forward, be yourself I've, I've never wanted anything No I've  I've never wanted anything so bad, so bad Cardboard masks of all the people I've been Thrown out with all the rusted, tangled Dented God Damned miseries You could say I'm hard to hold But if you knew me you'd know I've got a good father And his strength is what makes me cryBeautiful pain Beautiful hurt Beautiful face Beautiful earth And you my love, most lovely of all Won’t fall Beautiful heart Beautiful words Beautiful loss Beautiful world And you my love, most lovely of all Oh you my love, most lovely of all Won’t fall Wonderful days Wonderful sounds Barely a breath It’s heaven or hell And you my love, most lovely of all Oh you my love, most lovely of all Won’t fall
