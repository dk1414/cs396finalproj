I woke up to the morning sky first Baby blue, just like we rehearsed When I get up off this ground, I shake leaves back down To the brown, brown, brown, brown 'til I’m clean Then I walked where I'd be shaded by the trees By a meadow of green For about a mile I'm headed to town, town, town in style With all my favorite colors, yes, sir All my favorite colors, right on My sisters and my brothers see ’em like no other All my favorite colors It's a good day to be, a good day for me A good day to see my favorite colors, colors My sisters and my brothers, they see 'em like no other All my favorite colors Now take me to the other side Little bitty blues birds fly In gray clouds, or white walls, or blue skies We gon' fly, feel alright And we gon', ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, yeah They sound like ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, yeah And the least I can say, I anticipate A homecome parade as we renegade in the morning, right onI've got your number, lonely October 33 I wear it on my soul’s back Like fair, fair, fair And I can hear the brass ring, I hear it in the nosebleeds Where you once felt a cold breeze Think it was Halloween I've got your number, lonely October 33 That's cold facts, fa, fa, fa Holds me down, like you know how, darlin’Hold me now, like you know my plight Got your number, I do Alone in the back I'm sending love where you are at I do I've got your number, lonely October 33 Your love's my only good thing Like fair, fair, fair So help me hear the bird sing I'll help you capture your dream Let's see it in the present and try to let it beUnder the raging sun's open fire, fire, fire Ain't nothin' new, ain't nothin' new We all have desires I want you to be my woman, babe Every time you get dressed in black You give a grown man a heart attack I pray that good Lord will bring you back You're my sunshine Shoot me down and break my heart It's the black moon rising You brave the sight, I paint the picture And you want to do it'Cause all she wants to do is cruise to the black moon rising Right on, right on, baby, yeah Cruise What's going on Same ol' thing, just a different season One hundred years and the only time she gets dressed in black Taking flight, baby, count you down On your way off without a sound Black moon rising above the clouds You're my sunshineLet's float on, out on this mothership, baby Let's take control of it Get it together Flight of the bumblebee, for my honey baby Make you wanna sing, get up Lock hands and sway with me, fire Filling around the blaze, get it together I can't get comfortable With me listening what the people say I want to know you better I gotta take this time Stop and see the weather I gotta love you right I want to know you better Oh, baby Forward Let us be unified, baby Out of this galaxy, moving Free in the way we move And she'll catch the groove Make me see it through Get it together Light up my fire bank Hold hands Everything's everything Got to get it together Cruise in my lover's lane Now I realize How to really flyI've got a song on my heart, baby She keeps me grooving, steady grooving Got a lover on my mind That keeps me wanting, steady wanting more There’s a fire, call the fireman If you're in pain, baby, call a doctor Don't be afraid to say "I need you"I will understand Baby love, pretty woman, walking down the way If you get tired, use your soul power and you’ll find the way And if there's a fire, call the fireman If you're in pain, baby, call the doctor Don't be afraid to say "I need you"I will understand Help me understand Oh, I long for your lovin', I can't get enough When you tell me I can be there when you love againLife is just, life is keen I put in work, do my thing To keep me merrily on the scene Keep me merrily on the scene"Make me wise, take me far"Says the mind unto the heart Keep me merrily on the scene Keep me merrily on the scene In life's confines, I try In life's confines, I try to let my soul refine But never mind how fast you go We all shine, then burn over Like the stars in the night So cast a dream and watch it glide To keep you merrily on the scene Keep you merrily on the scene'Cause in life's confines We've got to let our souls refine And if this light should burn out May we carry on, child Gently down the streamOld man, the world is on your shoulder And your heart is on your sleeve May you find the pretty things To beat the stormy weather Sunsets over water Show you how to dream in the sweet power of love Sure enough, brother, sure enough, sister The sweet power of love will keep us elevated, baby When the sun don't shine When the clouds come home And we can't go on holding on Ain't no need to worry, baby If you've got soul, then you got fire Ain't no need to worry, baby Let my love take you higher Old man, when your mind is downtrodden By the powers that be Remember where you come from The sweet power of love There's so much lovin'So much coming The sweet power of love will keep us elevated, babyTake me down off your pedestal I've got a name, I've got a name Lovers do what the lovers do I do the same, I do the same Let me touch the sky, brother Let's play the game I do my thing'Til I'm satisfied,
