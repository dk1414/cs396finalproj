Can't count the years on one hand That we've been together I need the other one to hold you Make you feel, make you feel better It's not a walk in the park To love each other But when our fingers interlock Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it'Cause after all this time, I'm still into you I should be over all the butterflies But I'm into you And baby even on our worst nights I'm into you Let 'em wonder how we got this far'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you Recount the night that I first met your mother And on the drive back to my house I told you that, I told you that I loved ya You felt the weight of the world Fall off your shoulder And to your favorite song We sang along to the start of forever And after all this time, I'm still into you I should be over all the butterflies But I'm into you And baby, even on our worst nights I'm into you Let 'em wonder how we got this far'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you Well, some things just, some things just make sense And one of those is you and I Some things just, some things just make sense And even after all this time I'm into you Baby, not a day goes by That I'm not into you I should be over all the butterflies But I'm into you And baby, even on our worst nights I'm into you Let 'em wonder how we got this far'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into youOne, two All that I want Is to wake up fine Tell me that I'm alright That I ain't gonna die All that I want Is a hole in the ground You can tell me when it's alright For me to come out Hard times Gonna make you wonder why you even try Hard times Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry These lives And I still don't know how I even survive Hard times, hard times And I gotta get to rock bottom Walking around With my little rain cloud Hangin' over my head And it ain't coming down Where do I go Give me some sort of sign You hit me with lightning Maybe I'll come aliveHit that, hit that snare I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock It's a matter of time before we all run out When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth I waited eight long months, she finally set him free I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me Two weeks and we caught on fire She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile Woah, I never meant to brag But I got him where I want him now Woah, it was never my intention to brag To steal it all away from you now But God, does it feel so good'Cause I got him where I want him now And if you could, then you know you would'Cause God, it just feels so It just feels so good Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you Looking as innocent as possible to get to who They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right Well, I refuse, I refuse, I refuseWhen I was younger, I saw My daddy cry and curse at the wind He broke his own heart and I watched As he tried to reassemble it And my mama swore that she would Never let herself forget And that was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love if it does not exist But, darling, you are the only exception You are the only exception You are the only exception You are the only exception Maybe I know somewhere Deep in my soul that love never lasts And we've got to find other ways To make it alone or keep a straight face And I've always lived like this Keeping a comfortable distance And up until now, I had sworn To myself that I'm content with loneliness Because none of it was ever worth the riskMan, you really know how to get someone down Everything was fine until you came around And I've been chasing after dreamers in the clouds After all, wasn't I the one who said To keep your feet on the ground Man, you really brought me back down Hold on to hope if you got it Don't let it go for nobody They say that dreaming is free But I wouldn't care what it cost me You got me tied up, but I stay close to the window And I talk to myself about the places that I used to go I'm hoping someday maybe I'll just float away And I'll forget every cynical thing you say When you gonna hear me out Man, you really bring me down Hold on to hope if you got it Don't let it go for nobody They say that dreaming is free But I wouldn't care what it cost meLow-key, no pressure Just hang with me and my weather Low-key, no pressure Just hang with me and my weather Rose-colored boy I hear you makin' all that noise about the world you want to see And, oh, I'm so annoyed'Cause I just killed off what was left of the optimist in me And, ooh, hearts are breakin' and wars are ragin' on And I have taken, uh, my glasses off You got me nervous, I'm right at the end of my rope A half-empty girl, don't make me laugh, I'll choke Just let me cry a little bit longer I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to Hey, man, we all can't be like you I wish we were all rose-colored too My rose-colored boy Low-key, no pressure Just hang with me and my weatherI don't mind Lettin' you down easy, but just give it time If it don't hurt now, but just wait, just wait a while You're not the big fish in the pond no more You are what they're feedin' on So what are you gonna do When the world don't orbit around you  So what are you gonna do When the world don't orbit around you Ain't it fun Livin' in the real world Ain't it good Bein' all alone Where you're from You might be the one who's runnin' things Well, you could ring anybody's bell and get what you want You see, it's easy to ignore trouble When you're livin' in a bubbleNo, sir Well, I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore It's your turn So take a seat, we're settling the final score And why do we like to hurt so much I can't decide You have made it harder just to go on And why All the possibilities, well, I was wrong That's what you get when you let your heart win Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh That's what you get when you let your heart win Whoa-oh-oh-oh I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating And that's what you get when you let your heart win Whoa-oh-oh-oh I wonder How am I supposed to feel when you're not here 'Cause I burned Every bridge I ever built when you were here I still try Holding onto silly things, I never learn Oh, why All the possibilities, I'm sure you've heardI love makin' you believe what you get is what you see But I'm so fake happy, I feel so fake happy And I bet everybody here is just as insincere We're all so fake happy and I know fake happy See, I been doin' a good job of makin' 'em think I'm quite alright, better hope I don't blink You see, it's easy when I'm stompin' on a beat But no one sees me when I crawl back underneath Hey, if I smile with my teeth I bet you believe me If I smile with my teeth I think I believe me Oh, please, don't ask me how I've been Don't make me play pretend, oh, no Oh, what's the use Oh, please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too And if I go out tonight, dress up my fears You think I look alright with these mascara tears See, I'm gonna draw my lipstick wider than my mouth And if the lights are low, they'll never see me frownHow can I decide what's right When you're clouding up my mind I can't win your losing fight All the time Nor can I ever own what's mine When you're always taking sides But you won't take away my pride No, not this time Not this time How did we get here When I used to know you so well But how did we get here Well, I think I know The truth is hiding in your eyes And it's hanging on your tongue Just boiling in my blood But you think that I can't see What kind of man that you are If you're a man at all Well, I will figure this one out
