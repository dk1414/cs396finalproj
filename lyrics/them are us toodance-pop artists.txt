Can't help but look back I'm lost in my memories Caught up with nostalgia Think of what we had You've always been dear to me So I stuck around ya But so long as you’re my one true love I stay hypnotized Holding space for what once was Can’t help but look back I’m lost in my memory Caught up with nostalgia Look through colored glass Creating a fantasy to find eudaemonia But so long as you’re my one true love I stay petrified, dreaming of you I hope that I don’t waste my life away After looking at us from the outside You wonder if I’d be willing to work things out Oh, I can’t say no to that No, I can’t say no to that No, I can't say no to that No, I can't say no to that No, I can't say no to thatHide from you, hide from me Swallow pain, lock, and key I cannot lie, no not again Nothing true, no one clean Learn to see under skin Hard as glass, close as kin How can I push myself away Without form, holdingin Sight unseen Won't hold the hand that guides me Don't want to keep you tied to what you aren't I know your head, I know your heart Don't want to step inside your private soul A secret place that's not for me to knowSlipping slowly backward Across an open floor I should have done much better I should have done much more There was no reason for it No sacred alibi No possibility of Living a perfect lie I should have asked for more I should have asked for more I should have asked for more I should have asked for more I should have asked for more I should have asked for more I wasn’t cut out for this I wasn’t cut out for this I wasn’t cut out for this I wasn’t cut out for this I wasn’t cut oh-oh-out Slipping quickly backward Into a darkened cave Ignore the standards by which We are meant to behave I wish you did not worry I always knew you would A permanent condition To be misunderstood: Kennedy Ashlyn]How'd you seep into my heart How'd you seep into my heart No, I'll try not to fall apart How'd you seep into my heart How'd you seep into my heart How'd you seep into my heart No, I'll try not to fall apart How'd you seep into my heart Oh, our love will drift away Like a picture left out to fade But I hope that when it does, it's because I didn't want you anyway How'd you seep into my heart How'd you seep into my heart No, I'll try not to fall apart How'd you seep into my heart I've not let anyone slip in yet Past anxiety and regret But perhaps it could be you to slip through I wouldn't count on itWhen I was younger I thought of you only I just want to be alone, but I'm just lonely Oh I still have your picture Where I can see it every day Not that I look much I just can't throw it away When I was younger I thought of you only I just want to be alone, but I'm just lonely Oh I still have your picture Where I can see it every day Not that I look much I just can't throw it away Funny how time goes on but you won't leave me Pictures of what once was flashing on repeat Oh you're so inconsistent Don't know how much more I can take Building resilience with every heartbreak Why oh why did I allow myself to sleep Make excuses, rules, and many dates to keep Why oh why did I allow myself to cry Why oh why did I, did I, did I I dream of one of a kind It seems sometimes you're hard to find You're hard to find, you're hard to find You're hard to find, you're hard to I've yet to tire of your eyes The days go by but time it flies The time it flies, the time it flies The time it flies, the times just All I want is the simplest love All I've got is the simplest love There's so much for us to do With no one else, just me and you Just me and you, just me and you Just me and you, there's only All I want is the simplest love All I've got is the simplest loveA single moment Wouldn't I Your arms around me Suicide Please help me, please My fronds are withered Water me Resent me, please I am a willow Let me weep The world we made I Must abide Now so hollow How can I A bond so deep would Never rust I'll try to honor Know I must Please help me, please My fronds are withered Water me Resent me, please I am a willow Let me weepA million ghosts, I hid them I hope you don't despise me I begged you to let me in Now I know, now I know I wanted to be something that I'm just not A thousand lies, a thousand lies We're swimming in the ocean but at whose cost We will die, we will die Well I've been told the melody lingers on How can I  How can I I see you and I see someone I knew before But who am I, who am I, who am I Who am I, who am I Who am I, who am I Flickers of a false crescent moon I was starting to fall deep in love with you Oh what will become of us Oh what will become of us Injuries do nothing to our love But anomalies are what I'm dreaming of Oh what will become of us Oh what will become of us Despite my shortcomings, I'm alright I'm alright Looking at each moment as the past I'm left wondering which one Will be the last Oh what will become of us Oh what will become of us Foolish thoughts For which there are no cure Complicate the things That I once knew for sure Oh what will become of us Oh what will become of us Won't you speak to me, love Why won't you speak to me, love Won't you speak to me, love Why won't you speak to me, love Bittersweet, this being young So bittersweet, this being young Bittersweet, this being young So bittersweet, this being young Ghosting silent as the world Passes me by Waiting for the day I turn Back to life Won't you speak to me, love Why won't you speak to me, love Won't you speak to me, love Why won't you speak to me, love
