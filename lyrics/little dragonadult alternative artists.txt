Twice I turn my back on you I fell flat on my face but didn't lose Tell me where would I go Tell me what led you on, I'd love to know Was it the blue night, gone fragile Was it about the men, in wonder steady going under Was it the light ways, so frightening Was it a two wills  One mirror holding us dearer now Thought I had an answer once But your random away swept me along Colossal signs so I got lost With so many lovers singing songs Was it the blue night, gone fragile Was it about the men, in wonder steady going under Was it the light ways, so frightening Was it a two wills  One mirror holding us dearer nowRitual union's got me in trouble again I was wondering of a white dress And the mistress and a spirit holding my hand Love is sinking in the sand Petals falling on demand My feet are running like the wind I'm sorry, boy, that we sinned Love is not like they say A lie, that it's hard to make it stay I drown my feelings in the sea They dried out over on the beach Ritual union's got me in trouble again I was wondering of a white dress And the mistress and a spirit holding my hand Mother, tell me how it is I know you've been through all of this You ran away so many times Your kids, your heart, a couple of dimes Love is not like they say A lie, that it's hard to make it stay I drowns my feelings in the sea They dried out over on the beachCorridor lies with the river run watery eyes I stand waitin' for my turn, determined to rise The spirits blew around like a hurricane whip The girls who melt like my ice cream drip Somebody from his head said You can turn off and feel better When everything's clear like cold weather Go feel better, feel better Somebody from my heart said I could turn off and never wake up When everything's clear, my breath made Like steam fade, feel better Fallin' apart, apart, apart, apart, apart Finally they called my name The ghost inside come wake us to life Making my chair do flips Giving into this, we’ll be safe every time Fallin' through the floor on my broken butterfly wing Gimme me one more, the girl from the corridor sing, she singThe green mermaid And the wavy mane The California dream Riding a unicone through your Dali The free fantasy That carefree, that beginner's love The sugar don't live up Sailin' on a banana peel Your trophy star Chewing a protein bar You magnify the universe Grab your purse Grab your love Pretty girl, don't get stuck You're aiming for the royal scene The fast luck TV dreams Pretty girl, don't get struck So Bubble Hills, don't you ever burst Never let her down Passing our time on the trailed out crumbs The birds ate their round Hawaiian drinks and a famous face You're posin' innocent Those new lashes don't go to waste But it could pay your rentI guess we'll never get started Let's save the silence all night No need for talking about it Sometimes, the quiet feels so right High Over the north star Sleepless, so far Together, we are High Trapped in the holiday affair A new silence filled the air I rest my head on your shoulder There's nowhere else I'd rather be Right there, a little bit slower Feel free to roll another one for me High Over the north star Sleepless, so far Together, we are High Trapped in the holiday affair A new silence filled the airTwo months ago now Since she came around this house Her answering machine's full He thinks listening could give her doubts But when this girl's made up her mind She's made up her mind, made up her mind Looking out to the horizon No turnin' back, no wastin' time Smooth cat rider Stop bragging 'cause she broke your facade Don't we all want to be stars and all Stop playing with the one that you love Smooth cat rider Stop bragging 'cause it's gone to your head So smooth, but she was smart instead Stop playing with the one that you love A fountain in the hall Big old portraits of himself on the wall A diamond sculpture face This peacock is flying all over the place The tiger's extra claws, no, she's not impressed Your laughs and stupid jokes, the only thing she missed Now you can't stop looking back Leaving messagesI can’t understand what I'm doing Don't understand where we going Please understand where I'm coming from Understand that it's all in me But not plain to see Please Understand that we strumming Why understand where we going I understand life be flowing Dreaming as you be talking to me About where we’ll be I’m wearing your gold You whispering that it’s over to yourself It's creeping up my shoulder I understand where we're coming from Understand my devotion Don’t understand what we're doing Understand that it's plain to see But not clear to me Where the river flow, that’s where I wanna go With you, with you, with you I just know that we are always love, oh-ooh Love our darkness and love our sorrows, oh When it's time for summer I just know that we will always bloomOh my god, it's green  The fire  Go!It's that time to transform To come around, I'm changing Ooh, there's an angel knocking at my window Trying to tell me where to go next This small town without you It feels cold, it's creepin'Moving on, I'll look ahead instead Spirit divide, drift along I waved her goodbye, I carried on Trams pass, my black dress Folded on a big mess I'm changing my next flight to Paris The hourglass, it tick-tock too fast for our destiny I've got a full drawer of letters Remember it was Paris you said we were gonna meet Why your answering machine still on It's the oddest feeling since you're gone A part of me drift away with you And will never returnRather be a bandit than a lover Rather be a man with the other To run the mountain down, run it down Rather be a whisper in heaven Than a daughter locked in your prison So run the mountain down, run it down You are airborne You’ve got silver rays Will it ever float Will it ever soar along Grip the crown like a winner Pretending like a beginner So run the mountain down, run it down You are airborne You got silver rays Will it ever float Will it ever soar along All for the feather Did it all for your feathered hand Will it ever float Will it ever soar along You keep an eye upon my back Rock me in a trance, rockin' my balance I had a taste and it was sweet Almost knocked me dead, in my dreams are wet Won't you help me now 'Cause the night is over And I'm runnin' out I feel it takin' over Won't you help me now 'Cause my night is over And I'm runnin' out I'm losin', I'm losin'I'm losin' my mind I'm movin', I'm movin'I'm movin' in time I'm losin', I'm losin'I'm losin' my mind I give it all for the high Wake me every time, wait to 'til past midnight And if the devil would arrive Play me bittersweet, knock me off my feet
