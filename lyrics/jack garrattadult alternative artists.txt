When I grow old, I'll drink and smoke Like I did when youth stayed, youth stayed'Til the second round When I grow old, the sun will cope Shine on every youth stain, youth stain Never settling down And no wonder I keep you close You're the water to quench my throat And if I never let you go Will you keep me young Keep me young When I grow old, my weathered soul And memories recluse, elusive Help me take them out So keep me young and call my bluffs And help me out when you say, you say There's no room for doubt Say I'm stronger and keep me close And be the water and test my cold And if I never let you go Will you keep me young Keep me youngI wouldn't compliment myself for what I've become Tell her I owe it to her Tell her I owe it to her I wouldn't praise myself for every good thing I've done Tell her I owe it to her Tell her I owe it to her Tell her I owe it to every heartbeat Tell her I owe it to every exhale Tell her I owe it to, owe it to her Hands upon my chest Oh, won't you breathe life into these dead lungs I keep under my coat And keep life warm against the cold night as our bodies grow old I know when to give up and I know when to breathe Believe me, I owe it to her Tell her I owe it to her Tell her I owe it to every heartbeat Tell her I owe it to every inhale Tell her I owe it to, owe it to her Hands upon my chestTake all of the love you're given Through the gap in the wall Seal it tight with light blue ribbon Then unlock the door But your ego won't let you love And your fear is your downfall If you won't take the love you're given Then at least let me go Please let me go, please let me go Please let me go, please let me go Please let me go, please let me go I've been trying to give you my love But you won't let me, won't let me I've been trying to give you some space But you won't let me, won't let me I've been trying to save you the trouble But you won't let me, won't let me I've been trying to give you my love Don't feed the solace within you And allow it to grow Cause when the leaves, the blossom become you They'll turn black and they'll fall I promise you if you're gonna lock me out I will stand as your ghost If you take the love you're given I will leave you alone I will leave you alone I will leave you aloneMy nights are broken up by the sounds of women I’ll never meet And when my eyes are closed I can start to feel you staring at me The right side of my bed has always left me feeling stuck in between Everything I know and all the lies I tell myself so I can sleep Pick apart the pieces you left Don’t you worry about it, don’t you worry about it Try and give yourself some rest And let me worry about it, let me worry about it You came around to say that you’ve been away, like I hadn’t known As if I don’t wake up every single day not seeing you go As if this moon of ours only shines a half to make me feel whole As if I haven’t felt your breath in every step I take when the wind blows Pick apart the pieces you left Don’t you worry about it, don’t you worry about it Try and give yourself some rest And let me worry about it, let me worry about it Pick apart the pieces you left Don’t you worry about it, don’t you worry about it Try and give yourself some rest And let me worry about it, let me worry about itSpeak and open up your mind It's something you should do all the time Keep exploring, seek and find You know you might surprise yourself Talk without a taint to hold The doubts that should embrace your heart The calm and chaos of your soul You know you might surprise yourself Take a pen and write this down Draw something that can't be found And learn to walk again somehow You know you might surprise yourself Lover, if you only knew The times that train has fooled me too And tears me from a place I know It helps me to surprise myself You know you can surprise yourself So let go and surprise yourselfMy love is overdone, selfish and domineering It won’t sit up on the shelf So don’t try to reason with my love My love is powerful, ruthless and unforgiving It won’t think beyond itself So don’t try to reason with my love And when you pray, he will not answer Although you may hear voices on your mind They won’t be kind My love won’t reason, loosen up the chains that bound you Don’t try to reason with my love My love is chemical, shallow and chauvinistic It’s an arrogant display So don’t try to reason with my love And when you pray, he will not answer I know this for I ask him all the time To reassure my mind My love won’t reason, loosen up the chains that bound you My love won’t reason, break away the walls surrounding you My love won’t reason, free you from the pain you’re captive by Don’t try to reason with my loveI'm built to break I give to take Mind, body and soul I feel to burn I heal to hurt Human after all But I can feel I'm far from grace Thirsty for your warm embrace Under my arms But think of all the infinite ways You can think of something to say But fall dumb Give me something, I can't be without Give me reason to follow you down I really want you I really love you Give up, lay down Sink deep in the ground Become the fall But I run and hide Cower from the fight Be still my soulTell me I'm fire, baby Tell me to open up Shield my eyes, baby They've seen so much Tell me you're mine, baby Tell me before I erupt Burn up in the sky, baby Become the dust I can see no use in it Ignoring your burning heart just to calm mine It's such a waste of your time But to love you takes every waking thought I have when daylight comes To relieve the night Give me your fire Give me reasons to learn Give me every excuse to burn Let your flames rise Let your flames riseLower my defences And I'll take all the punches Darling, for you, you Vinegar my wounds now Clean the blood off my brow Darling, for you, you And I'll duck and I'll weave But it's all in vain Cause when the count's ten We'll start this again We'll start this again And I will fall down, baby I will fall for you And feel my lips swell, baby Know that I fell for you Cut, bruised and humbled Punch drunk, I stumble Over to you, you In silence I'm falling The crowds are all calling Out for you, youIf I ever cause you Destruction or pain Fault me for my actions Fault me for my brain For I know, I know All what I do If I ever give you Hurt or distain Fault me for destruction Fault me for your shame For I know, I know All what I do I know, I know All what I do If I ever leave you Your eyes will remain The sweetest comfort In which I could lay But if I could hold you All I would say Is I know, I know All what I do I know, I know All what I do I know, I know All what I do
