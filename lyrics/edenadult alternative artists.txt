One, two, three Yeah, she's in love with the concept As if we're all just how she imagined'Cause we're in love, I just don't know it yet, huh Well, tell me how am I supposed to see the magic 'Cause I don't believe in it no more But I won't tell her'Cause I always imagined It's easier if she thinks she won So I'ma let her, and she said"I don't think I love you no more You never seem to call me lately"Girl, I don't think you know me at all'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this No I don't love you, and I never did Look at us burning down in flames for kicks But just know I'm not singing for your X OI'm just singing 'cause it's over, yeah'Cause I had the best of the worst sides And I had these lungs, ohh And I had too many flashbacks That I just let them burn'Till my chest is on fire And my head just won't die I guess I'm lying 'cause I wanna I guess I'm lying 'cause I don't'Cause I just feel so tired Like it's move or slowly die You say, "You ain't you when you're like this This ain't you and you know it"But ain't that just the point You don't know how to let go Who said this must be all or nothing But I'm so caught below, and I'll never let you know No, I can't tell you nothing'Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes But still I could always be Whatever you wanted But not what you needed Especially when you been needing me'Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes And I'll say what I don't mean Just 'cause I wanted Or maybe I need it Swear lying's the only rush I need'Cause we've been driving so long I can't remember how we got here Or how we survived so long Trying to run from our pride'Till you set fire to my atmosphere And I remember how I spent the twenty-third Feeling six feet under When I'm thirty-thousand feet in the air Chasing that sundown So far east I'm westbound Feeling like the edge of this world is near But you'll feel better when you wake up Swear to god I'll make up Everything and more when I get back someday This is more than just a phase, love Shooting stars all break up And even though it seems like half the world away Things will be better in America Heard the streets are gold there Maybe I could fly you out this place someday Chasing dreams like I'm on Novocaine Screaming through your airwaves Looking back I almost thought I heard you saySo tell me this is who you are, yeah They tell me I've got something more And oh, you could be loved But I don't want the lights to find me When I'm dark and lost, but never on my own'Cause I just wanna swing like Sinatra Singing like I can't stop'Cause I could never rock like a Rolling Stone I just wanna live like the ones before, yeah And maybe I could play guitar like Hendrix or save the world or end it, and Then maybe they'll remember me when I'm gone That's all I could ever want That's all I want So I got ten minutes to be all or nothing to whoever wants to hear And I got ten weeks of talking bullshit on repeat till I'm burnt out and disappear But I owe you nothing And I own my luck Oh, they said, "You'll never be alone again"But I don't think you understand me or what I fear"But you could be loved"But I don't wanna lie to tell myself I'm more than all the mistakes I've outrun'Cause I'm only here for a minuteAnd I said what's up  What you been thinking 'Cause you've been staring at that roof so long, I swear it's come alive And she spoke nine words and now we're sinking But I can't find it in myself to want to lie to keep this thing from going down'Cause that girl took my heart And I ain't want it back No I'm laying down my cards'Cause you said it meant nothing And I should've kept my silence But I guess I'm too attached to my own pride to let you know That all these words meant nothing And I've always been this heartless But we're just having sex, no, I would never call it love But love Oh, no, I think I'm catching feelings And I don't know if this is empathy I feel Just hold on Remember why you said this was the last time I wanted you to be the last thing on my mind I wanted you to be the reason I close my eyes But I can't sleep and, oh, God, I wanted to be your high But everything I said went unheard And everything you saw with eyes straight blurred became our downfall'Cause you say I drink and I smoke and I talk too much But I know, you lie when you said that you just gotta go and save yourself So hear me out You know, everybody talks, girl, and it means nothing till you let it But if you keep second guessing, then there's only gonna be one end You can leave if you really want to And you can run if you feel you have to Now, I'll be fine if you ever ask me I know it's hard, but no one said, it's easy Falling's easy, but there's only one way up So I've been thinking that I think too much And I can't sleep but I can dream of us And I've been seeing shit like horror cuts It's burning down, I gotta drown this out And you said, you need me to let this go But it's who I am or am I just losing it 'Cause you said jump and I went first, but falling's always been my downfallOne, two, three Yeah, she's in love with the concept As if we're all just how she imagined'Cause we're in love, I just don't know it yet, huh Well,
