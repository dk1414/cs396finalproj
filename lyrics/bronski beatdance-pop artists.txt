To your soul To your soul Cry Cry Cry You leave in the morning with everything you own in a little black case Alone on a platform, the wind and the rain on a sad and lonely face Mother will never

turn away, run away, turn away, run away Pushed around and kicked around, always a lonely boy You were the one that they'd talk about around town as they put you down And as hard as they would try they'd hurt to make you cry But you never cried to them, just to your soul No, you never cried to them, just to your soulTell me why Tell me why Contempt in your eyes when I turn to kiss his lips
