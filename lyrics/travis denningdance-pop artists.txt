I probably shouldn't have said hello When I saw you out with your friends I know I should've left it alone When I caught you looking A little smile, a little how you been A little touch, a little reminisce It always starts off innocent But after a few drinks It's always the same thing We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar Then after a few songs The kind that you hold on We find ourselves leaning up against my car Shoulda stopped at one Said goodbye, given up at two If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do After a few Oh, after a few We always take it way too far Where it's too much to resist We always make it way too hard To walk away after that third kissBought it with cash, weeks’ worth of cuttin’ grass From a senior in the parking lot That faded I D looked a little like me But honestly, it’s still a long shot So, I studied every word, memorized every line'Til I worked up the nerve one Friday night Threw a case of beer up on the counter at a Circle K And I became David Ashley Parker from Powder Springs November 27 turnin' 235 foot 9, brown hair, blue eyes Levi’s, tee shirt, all-American guy Made all the right moves, said all the right things Showed up with the smokes and I bought all the drinks Whadn’t who I was but every now and then I got to be David Ashley Parker from Powder Springs That little plastic card got me into

pads popping a mile away Just down the road there’s Kenwood sub Shaking the door of a black half-ton Can’t hear the words, but you can feel that bass Heartbeat of a small town Soundtrack to a sundown Pumpin’ like a freight train Runnin’ through these red-white-’n’-blue-collar veins Southern wind blowin’ through pine trees Coke can poppin’ in the backseat Nothin’ like that middle of nowhere sound Heartbeat of a small town Heartbeat of a small town Cellphone buzzin’ up on the dash Baby sayin’,”Boy where you at ”Goodyears hummin’ down the road to her place And that whiskey whisper says”pull it over”Sound of that gravel when you hit the shoulder Chest poundin’ like that Chevy V8I don't know who bottled it up or who put on that label All I know is I ordered it up and it's sittin' on my table Who knows how many trucks it hitched a ride on How many shelves it spent the night on'Fore they put it on ice And put it on my tab tonight I don't know where that beer's been, but I know where it's goin'Into my hand, up to my lips second I crack it open Gonna tip it, sip it, crush it, kill it, get my sideways showin'I don't know where that beer's been, but I know where I know where it's goin'Could've been brewed in Colorado, Milwaukee, or St  Louie But the only thing on my mind right now is what it's gonna do to me I don't know where that beer's been, but I know where it's goin'Into my hand, up to my lips second I crack it open Gonna tip it, sip it, crush it, kill it, get my sideways showin'I don't know where that beer's been, but I know where it's goin'Down the hatch to my brain 'til I don't know my last name Up in the air, clankin' loud When it's gone, there's another one goin' downI pulled up in that two-tone single cab me and Dad fixed Four by four with a four inch lift Just high enough that I had to help her in Maybe it was that cracked windshield but I couldn't see Where that goin’ nowhere ride would lead I sure didn't think it would end with a kiss'Til it did Could’ve been the right song came on the radio The first time she got to drive off road And got her holdin' on to me that night It could've been the Glasspack twin-stacked tailpipes Still don't know why she fell for my sun beach bench seat Four-wheel-drive don't lie pick-up lines I don't remember those words I said comin' out smooth But I must've been makin’ all the right moves right up to my favorite part Where she said throw it in park Could’ve been the right song came on the radio The first time she got to drive off road And got her holdin' on to me that night It could’ve been the Glasspack twin-stacked tailpipes Still don't know why she fell for my sun beach bench seat Four-wheel-drive don't lie pick-up lines, yeahMy phone buzzed with a "Hey, what's up " and directions to a bonfire party Bring your own beer, everybody's here, yeah, we got a big one started That pallet wood flame's lightin' up the sky Diesel fuel smoke up ten foot high Come on, hop in that Chevy I would, man, but I'm already Sittin' by a fire She's pullin' back her hair You oughta see the spark there in her eyes Man, I ain't goin' nowhere Whatever this is I got my arms around It's burnin' too hot to let it go out And I ain't ever felt the way I'm feelin' right now Sittin' by a fire'Tween that windshield heart she's drawing in the dark The perfume on her skin That red hot kiss coming off her lips It all keeps drawing me in Nah, it ain't ever felt this real Oh, and I ain't ever felt these chills
