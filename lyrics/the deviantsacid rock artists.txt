death's dance And go loot the supеrmarket while we've got the chance The handsome ghetto It walks in flames The ancient curse did raise the stick The wild old girl with carved old eyes The pearls are too dark to hide Come on everybody, come gather 'round friends This is the day civilization ends And let's get together and do death's dance And go loot the supermarket while we've got the chanceSlum lord Slum lord Slum lord Slum lord Someday the world is gonna know the reason I was born Find out truth and stank and seal within the gathering storm See it all coming down the street from afar Overhead I'm standing right like death's a burning star And the world's gone insane, hear famous fortune scream As the old ancient legends walk waking from the dream Slum lord Slum lordWe've Got
