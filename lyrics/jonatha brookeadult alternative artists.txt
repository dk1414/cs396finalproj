I am not a child now I can take care of myself I mustn't let them down now Mustn't let them see me cry I'm fine I'm fine I'm too tired to listen I'm too old to believe All these childish stories There is no such thing as faith And trust And pixie dust I try, but it's so hard to believe I try, but I can't see where you see I try I try I try My whole world is changing I don't know where to turn I can't leave you waiting But I can't stay and watch This city burn Watch it burnIn the gloaming, oh my darling When the lights are soft and low And the quiet shadows falling Softly come and softly go When the trees are sobbing faintly With a gentle unknown woe Will you think of me and love me As you did once long ago In the gloaming, oh my darling Think not bitterly of me Though I passed away in silence Left you lonely, set you free For my heart was tossed with longing What had been could never be It was best to leave you thus, dear Best for you and best for me'Cause in the gloaming, oh my darling When the lights are soft and low Will you think of me and love me As you did once long ago And you say that you're okay You say you don't need anything, or anyone And that you're better off this way You'll be fine no matter what What's done is done Walking through these darkened rooms Filled with empty promises, and your perfume I'll leave the light on I know you'll be back I don't need to know any more than that So don't say a word, don't tell me where you've been I'll be here waiting, just to let you in And you tell me I'm naïve That love is not a fairy tale Maybe so, who would know 'Cause I'm the fool who still believes That there's a happy ending here Oh, that time will tell and love will knowI'm still chasing cars Playing in the undertow Barking at the stars, wondering where you are Thinking that I'll never know I still play with fire Hoping that I might get burned Toying with desire, teasing to the wire Thinking that I'll never learn Some things I earn Some things I steal And there's an angel on my shoulder But the devil's got the wheel I toe the line, but then I fall'Cause heaven knows I like the taste of danger most of all Danger most of all Standing on a ledge Don't you know I wanna jump Not that I would give my desire to live I just wanna try it once I just wanna know What it is to make the leap How the wind would blow, how fast I could go Who would pray my soul to keepI am walking past the sprinklers and the newly painted porches And the lemonade stand girls on a suburban afternoon I am leaving 'cause I love you, I am leaving 'cause I don't And I'm, I'm hoping you will follow And I'm praying that you won't let me go And I am captive in your presence I will melt before your eyes But I still crave your approval And I'm helpless when you criticize, criticize'Cause it's written on your body, it's on the tip of your tongue The look in your eyes in the glare of the sun The touch of your cold fingers when you say goodbye The way that you linger, the way that you lie You saw me through the keyhole of the door that I kept locked But I'd decorate the threshold just in case you knocked What I might feel on the edges you will never come to know And who I might be in the corners I will never ever, ever, ever show Ever show, noAll things being equal Her beauty was not her fault And it was not her only advantage Midst the feast and the novelty The manliness of his charms So was it really such a shock So much history in a kiss Besides they both knew it was over And what do they have to worry about Just privacy and pain And the damage they've done Is this all Can I go now Is this all Is this all Can I go now Is this all Hey, hey Hey So when you sleep do not dream Oh the dreams they weigh you down When you carry them along with you They will wrack your lovely body Report back to your soul With all the sickening sweets of the afternoon As we lose the last of innocence Like some romantic notion Buried by the fashion of disdain You can make the world your apple But take a bite before it sours Or you can make the world your charm or your chainWhen I was a little girl I had desires like you One of everything All the riches How could I help myself I was so naïve Santa Claus, Christmas eve, oh Careful what you wish for Careful what you do Even when you whisper Someone's listening to you Careful what you wish for Careful what you say Careful what you wish for'Cause it just might come true someday Now that I have everything I'm a puppet on a string Someone's got the end and I'm unraveling And here's the thing I would throw it all away If I could only hear you say"Baby I'll stay, baby I'll stay"I never knew what enough was Until I'd had more than my share And I let the darkness in It was then I lost the dare It was then I lost the day There will be no prayers on your return And there will be no party thrown And you will find your inheritance Is the silence that's grown It is the seed that you've sown'Cause you were the one sure thing The one sure thing Maybe I'm not crazy Just inconsolable Inconsolable Ha, hey Ah, hey There is no mystery to be revealed And so we tell the truth and then run I love you because I love you And I did think that you were the one But now I see who you've becomeYou know the tricks of the trade You can hit the soft spots at the center You dish it out and take it back Riding on the wave of your pompous ways Oh, but sooner or later You'll have to wring your lovely hands in dismay You'll go back to the boardroom Add the numbers up and turn the page at the end of the day Where were you at the bleakest of moments Where were you at the hint of success When through the window of opportunity came The glimmer of a day in the sun Glimmer of a day in the sun You took the canvas of a life Torn with the wind and the loss could still pull you along Pocketing images one by one Of the past, toward your future"A penny for your song"Position memories carefully You dust them off at holidays When you'll go back to the boardroom Declare your passion for the new dayI hope you're happy I hope you're happy with your glass half empty Even though you got your share Hope you're happy I hope you're happy with your glass half empty Even though you got your share Kevin you remind me, dot the i's Don't drop the names of those who've come before Ear down to the ground don't compromise Don't close your eyes until you get what you came looking for Kevin you remind me, don't look back, don't second guess Have another go, have another drink, 'cause it won't be long I look down at my hands and saw the violence, so I toss it back It's such a fine line between right and wrong And when you've made your mark They'll take you down And when you've had enough That's when they'll come around
