Old days, don't come to find me The sun is just about to climb up over there'While my heart is sinking I do not want my voice To go out into the air'Did you leave the darkness without me You're always miles ahead And you're standing in tomorrow on the runway Oh, be the music in my head The air around my bed, oh be my rest Replace the small disgraces of The times and places that I never really left Did you leave the darkness without me You're always miles ahead And you're standing in tomorrow on the runway Oh I want to fly, fly forward into the light Be alive, to come alive On the leaf-bright Friday drive Sudden horses at the red light Turn around, see clearer ways to go nowAnd you live life With your arms Reached out Eye to eye when speaking Enter rooms with great joy shouts Happy to be meeting And bright Bright Bright, bright as yellow Warm as yellow And I do not want to be a rose I do not wish to be pale pink But flower scarlet, flower gold And have no thorns to distance me But be bright Bright Bright, bright as yellow Warm as yellow Even if I'm shining Even if I'm shining Here Inside Even if I'm shouting Do you see that I'm Wanting That I want to be so so Bright Bright Bright, bright as yellow Warm as yellowLook for me another day I feel that I could change I feel that I could change There's a sudden joy that's like A fish, a moving light, I thought I saw it Rowing on the lakes of Canada Oh laughing man, what have you won Don't tell me what cannot be done My little mouth, my winter lungs Don't tell me what cannot be done, cannot be done Walking in the circle of a flashlight Someone starts to sing, to join in Talk of loneliness in quiet voices I am shy, but you can reach me Rowing on the lakes of Canada Rowing on the lakes of Canada Oh laughing man, what have you won Don't tell me what cannot be done My milky mouth, my winter lungs Don't tell me what cannot be done, cannot be done Look for me another time Give me another day I feel that I could change Yea in the silver sky Give another day I feel that I could change Rowing on the lakes of Canada Rowing on the lakes of Canada Rowing on the lakes of Canada Rowing on the lakes of Canada Rowing on the lakes of Canada Rowing on the lakes of Canada Rowing on the lakes of CanadaWhen you wake up, sun will shine We will not go under any cloud Let balloons go up in town Ring out every bell Happy birthday, beautiful All the birds of this day sing a song, sing a song Dream of trains carrying you Through the state parks with the cherry flowers When you wake up It will be the beginning of the world Happy birthday, beautiful In the fields of this day, hear a song, hear a song Oh, undeserved sweetness and light, stay by my side We will go out in the morning now A crown of maple leaves, a crown of flowers Circling your sweet head Happy birthday, beautiful In the streets of this day, play a song, play a songDown this street I ride a green bus Early, deep into town If I could speak, if I could be As I would like to be now-And what could I bring you Today in the meantime Fruit from the sunlight Quartz from the bay And where will I find this Perfect and wondrous I look into shops I slip into rain Slip into rain Leaves on leaves I walk through deeply Gold, green, gold For my friend I cannot find a thing Beautiful enough for you Again And what could I bring you Now in the meantime Fruit from the sunlight Quartz from the bay And where will I find this Perfect and wondrous I look into shops I slip into rain Slip into rainThe day is over and still so heavy on the mind In flew glowing, smiling mother, butterfly in yellow To join the frowning cactus crowd Finding flowers even there to flutter round I thought, isn't mother grand  The way she flies and flies Into the sting of the cold and the prick of the barbed wire Isn't mother grand to gladly fly and swiftly fly Into the sting of the cold and the prick of the barbed wire The day is over and still goes passing through the mind:In came glowing, smiling mother, sure and kind To rouse us, to give ourselves out and to cry Birth to warm intentions, worthless otherwise Oh, the lives that brush against us, pass us by and by The friends who may or may not come if we would first invite Oh, to open doors, to always gladly fly and fly Into the sting of the cold and the prick of the barded wireWhen Mac was swimming I was running late Walking around New Orleans looking for a birthday cake It was a great surprise to him so many people came Nobody knows, darling Nobody knows how they are loved Don't worry, my darling, the sun's coming up Let's get up early now, dive clear into the day Let's get out of the car with open arms, not wait to be embraced The flowers that grew, the things that happened since the day you came Nobody knows, darling Nobody knows how they are loved Don't worry, my darling, the sun's coming up Nobody knows, darling Nobody knows how they are loved Don't worry, my darling, the sun's coming up Nobody knows, darling Nobody knows how they are loved Don't worry, my darling, the sun's coming upRowing out into the air Taking blankets to the bay It's the same, and he was fine And, in the first place, was around That was another country That was another country I'm taking these dumb paper lanterns down Yards, no, miles, they strung along And me with them And how was I supposed to know about that That was another country Yeah, that was another country Are you all- are you alright Are you all- are you alright You're my friend Are you alright Rowing out into the air Driving home, home from the bay And we sang, and he was fine And what is more, he was around That was another country Yeah, that was another country Yeah, that was another countryThis dress that I made out of the curtains Was on the line, dancing around Better than I can Now we walk up to the top of the street Once letting go, rain sails us in a leafy boat Down the street And we'll be there before we know There go the lawn chairs Some frogs are racing them To catch up with me Gray buildings go by Violety sky lit up with trees in yellow Once letting go, rain sails us in a leafy boat Down the street And we'll be there before we know Hey, is that you, going by, swimming by Hey, is that you, zig-zagging, whizzing by Sailing up, sailing by Once letting go, rain sails us in a leafy boat Down the street And we'll be there before we knowBy-lo baby By-lo baby By-lo baby By-lo baby, by Mama will love you Mama will love you Mama will love you All my life Daddy will loves you Daddy will loves you Daddy will loves
