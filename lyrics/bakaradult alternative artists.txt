great night The next day she leaves and won't reply to any of my messages I don't hear from her in a while The next day my ex starts messaging me out the blue I haven't said anything to her about anything Haven't spoken to her for months, actually Some sort of guilty conscience I guess I open the messages but don't reply I pay no mind because there'll be no point A week later, a New York girl messages me saying that she feels bad because her ex was there the night we got together She feels bad both ways Says she wants to see me before I go I'm at the airport at this point We're a cycle of
