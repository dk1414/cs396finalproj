Oh yeah Yes he is Well he's a working class manOh Yeah I heard about a person who had a broken heart With nothing to drive him on, no hope no spark no flame He could'nt see at all tears they were blinding him He kept it all inside, the guilt and all the pain You know I say I tried to warn him They had him backed up against the wall I hope I'm not too late No one can tell you exactly what you have gotta be You've got to stand your ground and fight to save your life It may be hard but ooh ooh it's the only way Always remembering there ain't no second prize There ain't no second prize You

without You showed me just enough to fuel my fire My desire, never wanna live without it Both of us need something like we had before We can't keep fighting like this anymore This love affair is breaking my heart All the pushing and the shoving When you know that we ought to be loving And the lying and the cheating When we ought to be loving and squeezing So baby come on Lay down your guns and surrender Baby come on Lay down your guns and surrender Remember days we thought would last forever Nothing better but we let them slip away And in the end we make the bed we lie in Let's start trying What's the point of talking about itWell he's following the broken lines Living on borrowed time Motel rooms and broken hearts all left behind You swear he couldn't close his eyes As he shifts into overdrive He's been up and down this road so many times The man of his own And searching just keeps him proving That only the road Can tame the rebel in his soul It's the rhythm of the highway As he rolls on down And city lights as they fade from sight Drives the man behind the driving wheels Like a cowboy in a rodeo Riding hard but never letting go You'll be wand'ring through the twilight of his life Waylon Jennings on the radio Country music and engines roar Like a shooting star across a desert sky And he's got a home But it's out on the blue horizon Heaven only knows There's still a rebel in his soulKids out driving Saturday afternoon pass me by I'm just savouring familiar sights We share some history, this town and I And I can't stop that long forgotten feeling of her Time to book a room to stay tonight Number one is to find some friends to say "You're doing well After all this time you boys look just the same"Number two is the happy hour at one of two hotels Settle in to play "Do you remember so and so "Number three is never say her name Oh the flame trees will blind the weary driver And there's nothing else could set fire to this town There's no change, there's no pace Everything within its place Just makes it harder to believe that she won't be around Oh, who needs that sentimental bullshit, anyway You know it takes more than just a memory to make me cry And I'm happy just to sit here round a table with old friends And see which one of us can tell the biggest lies And there's a girl, she's falling in love near where the pianola stands With a young local factory out-of-worker, just holding hands And I'm wondering if he'll go or if he'll stay.. You walked in my life, with and angels smile How could I have known, the hunger locked inside We can start a fire, but we can't control the flame Now I just can't wait, to feel that heat again And in the middle of the night you cry     Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me I got a burning heart Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me Just seems like yesterday, I was running alone I turned my back on love, but baby I was wrong Do I miss your touch, do I tell myself a lie Can't get enough, when I'm lying by your side And in the middle of the night I cry   Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me I got a burning heart Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me Shadows moving on the wall Slowly we begin to fall Lying in a pool of sweat Another night I can't forget Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me I got a burning heart Too much ain't enough love to satisfy meEmotions ran high and the words were strong Heard the screen door slam and you were gone You can't win a fight you don't understand And I wake up alone reaching for your hand Like a cold wind in December When we don't see eye to eye I want you to remember I'm still on your side When you need me girl Still on your side As sure as the river runs to the sea There'll have to be times we both disagree Sometimes I feel like shouting It's like a freight train in my heart Make you see they'll be no doubting I'm still on your side When you need me girl Still on your side And I look up to see you standing there But you just look right through me Somebody tell me I'm dreaming Pretend you don't careWhen something is wrong with my baby Something is wrong with me If I know she's worried Oh I would feel that same old misery We've been through so much together We spoke as one and that's what makes it better Oh and just what just what she means to me now Oh you just oh you just wouldn't understand And the people say oh they say she's no good Oh but she's my woman and don't you know I'm her man If she's got a problem oh yeah yeah Oh I know I'm gonna have to help her solve it If she's got a problem oh I know I'm gonna help her You know I'm gonna have To help her somehow Oh sing it again When something is wrong with my baby Oh sure now When something is wrong with my baby oh Then something is wrong with meI pulled into Nazareth Was feelin' 'bout half past dead I just need someplace where I can lay my head'Hey mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed 'He just grinned and shook my hand, 'no' was all he said Take a load off Fanny Take a load for free Take a load off Fanny And..  and..  and...You put the load, put the load right on me I picked up my bags I went lookin' for a place to hide When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side I said 'Hey Carmen, come on let's go downtown'She said 'No, I've got to go But my friend can stick around'Take a load off Fanny Take a load for free Take a load off Fanny And..  and..  and...You put the load, put the load right on me Go down Miss Moses, there's nothin' that you can say It's just old Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the judgement day 'Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee ' He said 'Do me a favor son, won't you stay and keep Anna Lee company'
