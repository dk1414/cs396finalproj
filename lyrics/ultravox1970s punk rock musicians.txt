We walked in the cold air Freezing breath on a window pane Lying and waiting A man in the dark in a picture frame So mystic and soulful A voice reaching out in a piercing cry It stays with you until The feeling has gone, only you and I It means nothing to me This means nothing to me Oh, Vienna The music is weaving Haunting notes, pizzicato strings The rhythm is calling Alone in the night as the daylight brings A cool empty silence The warmth of your hand and a cold grey sky It fades to the distance The image has gone, only you and I It means nothing to me This means nothing to me Oh, ViennaDancing with tears in my eyes Weeping for the memory of a life gone by Dancing with tears in my eyes Living out a memory of a love that died It's five and I'm driving home again It's hard to believe that it's my last time The man on the wireless cries again It's over, it's over Dancing with tears in my eyes Weeping for the memory of a life gone by Dancing with tears in my eyes Living out a memory of a love that died It's late and I'm with my love alone We drink to forget the coming storm We love to the sound of our favorite song Over and over Dancing with tears in my eyes Weeping for the memory of a life gone by Dancing with tears in my eyes Living out a memory of a love that diedGive us this day All that you showed me The power and the glory'Til my kingdom comes CH OR US Give us this day All that you showed me The power and the glory'Til my kingdom comes Give me all the Storybook told me The faith and the glory'Til my kingdom comes And they say that in our time All that's good will fall from grace Even saints would turn their face In our time And they told us that in our days Different words said in different ways Have other meaning from he who says In our time CH OR US Give us this day All that you showed me The power and the glory'Til my kingdom comes Give me all the Storybook told me The faith and the glory'Til my kingdom comesReap the wild wind Reap the wild wind Reap the wild wind Reap the wild wind A finger points to show a scene Another face where mine had been Another footstep where I once walked Take it all You take my hand and give me your friendship I'll take my time and send you my slow reply Give me an inch, and I'll make the best of it Take all you want and leave all the rest to die Reap the wild wind A footprint haunts an empty floor A fading coat that I once wore Oh, a desolation where I once lived I have seen in times gone by I have felt A different shadow on the wall A stranglehold on a certain feelingR Ock Wrok ROck Wrok

Penetration boys in hotel lifts Invitations on sinking ships The whole wide world fits hip to hip In aircraft destroyers and cinema foyers The chaste and the chasers, amazing the neighbours Gay, wild and willing, stripped of graceMy sex Waits for me Like a mongrel waits Downwind on a tight rope leash My sex Is a fragile acrobat Sometimes I'm a novocaine shot Sometimes I'm an Automat My sex Is often solo Sometimes it short circuits then Sometimes it's a golden glow My sex Is invested in Suburban photographs Skyscraper shadows on a car crash overpass My sex Is savage, tender It wears no future faces Owns just random gender My sex Has a wanting wardrobe I still explore Of all the bodies I knew And those I want to knowSomehow we drifted off too far Communicate like distant stars Splintered voices down the phone The sunlit dust, the smell of roses drifts, oh no Someone waits behind the door Hiroshima, mon amour Riding inter-city trains Dressed in European grey Riding out to echo beach A million memories in the trees and sands, oh no How can I ever let them go Hiroshima, mon amour Meet beneath the autumn lake Where only echoes penetrate Walk through Polaroids of the past Features fused like shattered glass, the sun's so low Turns our silhouettes to gold Hiroshima, mon amourAnd just as my eyes start seeing After all the pain The twist in my life starts healing Just to twist again In stillness, in sorrow Returns that softly sighing lament Lament And just as the smile's returning After all the pain The fire inside stops burning Just to burn again In moments of madness Returns that softly sighing lament LamentIn a quiet street washed by the rain the room within the home A lonely man sits cheek to cheek with unique designs in chrome The mellow years have long gone by, but now he sits alone He has a brand new radio, but never turns it on New Europeans Young Europeans New Europeans A photograph of lovers lost lies pressed in magazines Her eyes belong to a thousand girls, she's the wife who's never seen Their educated son has left in search of borrowed dreams His television's in his bed, he's frozen to the screen New Europeans Young Europeans New Europeans On a crowded beach washed by the sun he puts his headphones on His modern world revolves around the synthesizer's song Full of future thoughts and thrills, his senses slip away He's a European legacy, a culture for todayNative these words seem to me All speech directed to me I've heard them once before I know that feeling Stranger emotions in mind Changing the contours I find I've seen them once before Someone cries to me Chorus:O o o o The look and the sound of the voice O o o o They try, they try O o o o The shape and the power of the voice O o o o In strong low tones Forceful and twisting again Wasting the perfect remains I've felt it once before Slipping over me Sweetly the voices decay Draw on the lines that they say I'd lost it once before Now it cries to me
