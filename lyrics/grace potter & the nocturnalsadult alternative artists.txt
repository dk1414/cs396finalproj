I lit a fire with the love you left behind And it burned wild and crept up the mountainside I followed your ashes into outer space I can't look out the window, I can't look at this place I can't look at the stars They make me wonder where you are Stars, up on Heaven's boulevard And if I know you at all, I know you've gone too far So I, I can't look at the stars All those times we looked up at the sky Looking out so far, we felt like we could fly And now I'm all alone in the dark of night The moon is shining, but I can't see the light And I can't look at the stars They make me wonder where you are Stars, up on Heaven's boulevard And if I know you at all, I know you've gone too far So I, I can't look at the starsYesterday, he said my eyes were fading fast away I said, "Well, what do you expect  You asked me not to stay And if it had all been for the best, I wouldn't feel this way"And he said Oh he said it's crazy, how love stays with me You know it hurts me, 'cause I don't wanna fight this war And it's amazing to see me reading through this scene Of love and fear and apologies Apologies My love is like a blanket that gets a little bit too warm sometimes I wanna wrap somebody in it who can hold me in his arms'Cause when it got a little too hot in there He was always stepping out for air and he froze Oh, he froze Oh he said it's crazy, how love stays with me, yeah You know it hurts me, 'cause I don't wanna fight this war And it's amazing to see me reading through this scene Of love and fear and apologies ApologiesUh Oh, yeah Uh, uh You got me down on the floor So what'd you bring me down here for You got me down on the floor So what'd you bring me down here for If I was a man, I'd make my move If I was a blade, I'd shave you smooth If I was a judge, I'd break the law And if I was from Paris If I was from Paris I would say, "Ooh la la, la la la la la""Ooh la la, la la la la la""Ooh la la, la la la la la""Ooh la la, la la la la la"You got me up on your swing So when you gonna shake that thing You got me up on your swing So when you gonna shake that thing Oh, oh-oh Oh, oh-oh Oh, oh-oh You runnin' 'round in circles But you won't find no better than this And after all your searchin'You come back to the place that you missed But I'm closin' up for the season I see you out there, you're freezin'But I'm never lettin' you back in again Oh no, oh no I'll never go

now I'll hold on to you, you hold on to me Ooh I found the heart of a lion In the belly of the beast And I held it in my hand, and I could feel I could feel, feel the beat Gas up the easy rider And head out for Nevada Can somebody let the beast out, baby It's time to meet your maker Make the road your undertaker Can somebody let the beast out, baby Can't stop the beat, can't stop the beat Run, but you can't hide from the heat Life is a record, playing on repeat I'm running wild with the lion, the beast, the beat So don't you try to tame the lion Just ride on the horizon Can somebody let the beast out, baby Yeah, we all hide our desire And then we feel the beat like fire Can somebody let the beast out, baby Take a long, hard look at my face Take away the things I can’t replace Take my heart, go on, take it away I've got nothing to say Take away this sense of regret Take the things I need to forget Take the mistakes I haven't made yet They're all I have left I don't want to be the one who lets you down All I did was run myself around I wish I could have seen through your eyes Maybe then I would have realized I'm the only one who's bleeding For the things I never needed The things I never needed Take a good, long look at yourself Take the weight off everyone else Take the hardest blow that was dealt It's all on your shoulders I don't want to be the one who lets you down All I did was run myself around I wish I could have seen through your eyes Maybe then I would have realized I'm the only one who's bleeding For the things I never needed The things I never neededWe got lost again, drove to the end of the road Met a red-faced man, taught us to do what we're told And on the twenty-third night Things ain't bad, but things ain't right Are we falling or flying Are we falling or flying Are we living or dying I guess we'll never know The air's so heavy, it could drown a butterfly If it flew too high And I get the feeling that the truck driver ain't shy Because he's lookin' at me, but nowhere near my eyes And on the thirty-fifth morning Things ain't good, but things ain't boring Are we falling or flying Are we falling or flying Are we living or dying I guess we'll never know Striking rock or hitting goldI have tried to find my way Make it through to a better day I have cried a mighty song But in the morning, everything was gone So come on, water Sweet water, wash me down Come on, water Sweet water, wash me down I have tried so many times To put out the devil's fire But every time I sit down to pray The devil's charm pulls me away So come on, water Sweet water, wash me down Come on, water Sweet water, wash me down Up in Heaven, they know the rule You’ve got to get down to the bathing pool Everybody, you’ve got to get in line Down at the river, we’re doing fineUn, deux, trois, quartre Oh la la You got me down on the floor So what'd you bring me down here for You got me down on the floor Well what'd you bring me down here for If I was a man I'd make my move If I was a blade I'd shave you smooth If I was crow, then I would caw And if I was from Paris If I was from Paris I would said:Oh-la-la-la-la-la-la, a-oh-la-la-la-la-la-la Oh-la-la-la-la-la-la, a-oh-la-la-la-la-la-la Hey  You got me up on your swing So when you gonna shake that thing Hey  You got me up on your swing So when you gonna shake that thing Cause if I was a man I'd make my move If I was a blade I'd shave you smooth If I was a crow, then I would caw And if I was from Paris If I was from Paris I would say:Oh-la-la-la-la-la-la, a-oh-la-la-la-la-la-la Oh-la-la-la-la-la-la, a-oh-la-la-la-la-la-la If I was a man I'd make my move If I was a blade I'd shave you smooth If I was a crow, then I would caw And if I was from Paris, if I was from Paris I would go: oh-la-la-la-la-la-laYou don't have to ask me why Because I know you understand All the treasures of my life Are right here in my hand Suspended in a moment No more breath to catch If you hold on to your end Maybe we can make this last This is the greatest time of day When all the clocks are spinning backwards And all the ropes that bind begin to fray And all the black and white turns into colors I don't want to build a wall Or draw a line across the sand Because there's room for one and all And this land is our land Oh, I hope this can go on and on and on Before the skipping stone hits the surface of the pond Oh, I know that life is never very long One second, then one minute, and then it's gone This is the greatest time of day When all the clocks are spinning backwards And all the ropes that bind begin to fray And all the black and white turns into colors
