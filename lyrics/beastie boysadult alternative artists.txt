so well It started way back in history With Ad-Rock, M CA,  Mike D Been had a little horsey named Paul Revere Just me and my horsey and a quart of beer Riding across the land, kicking up sand Sheriff's posse's on my tail 'cause I'm in demand One lonely Beastie I be All by myself without nobody The sun is beating down on my baseball hat The air is getting hot, the beer is getting flat Looking for a girl, I ran into a guy His name was M CA, I said, "Howdy," he said, "Hi"He told a little story that sounded well-rehearsed Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst The brew was in my hand, and he was on my tip His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry, he asked me for a sip He said, "Can I get some ", I said, "You can't get none!"Had a chance to run, pulled out his shotgun Quick on the draw, I thought I'd be dead He put the gun to my head, and this is what he said:"Now my name is M CA, I've got a license to kill I think you know what time it is, it's time to get ill Now what do we have here, an outlaw and his beer  I run this land, you understand  I've made myself clear "We stepped into the wind, he had a gun, I had a grin You think this story's over, but it's ready to beginTo Mario C—you can't front on that Well just plug me in just like I was Eddie Harris You're eating crazy cheese like you would think I'm from Paris You know I get fly, you think I get high You
