I think we could do it if we tried If only to say you're mine Sofia, know that you and I Shouldn't feel like a crime I think we could do it if we tried If only to say you're mine Sofia, know that you and I Shouldn't feel like a crime You know I'll do anything you ask me to But, oh my God, I think I'm in love with you Standing here alone now Think that we can drive around I just wanna say How I love you with your hair down Baby, you don't gotta fight I'll be here 'til the end of time Wishing that you were mine Pull you in, it's alright I think we could do it if we tried If only to say you're mine Sofia, know that you and I Shouldn't feel like a crimePolaroid of you dancing in my room I want to remember, I think it was about noon It's getting harder to understand, to understand How you felt in my hands, in my hands And I could be a pretty girl I'll wear a skirt for you And I could be a pretty girl Shut up when you want me to And I could be a pretty girl Won't ever make you blue And I could be a pretty girl I'll lose myself in you I was so blinded by you, now I cry Just thinking 'bout the fool that I was I was such a fool I'm alone now but it's better for me I don't need all your negativity And I could be a pretty girl I'll wear a skirt for you And I could be a pretty girl Shut up when you want me to And I could be a pretty girl I'll never make you blue And I could be a pretty girl I'll lose myself in youTu-tu-ru-tu-tu Tu-ru-tu-tu-tu Tu-tu-ru-tu-tu Tu-ru-tu-tu-tu Tu-tu-ru-tu-tu Tu-ru-tu-tu-tu Sometimes I feel like I just wanna go back to my old ways You're telling me I'm silly It's no fun in the old days I'm such a romantic I never remember how things really happen I guess you're attractive Or something Live in the moment That's what they tell me But what ever happened To when you would hold me And hold me And hold me Girlfriend or girl that's a friend It's easy just to pretend That we don't have something realEvery second counts I don't wanna talk to you anymore, and All these little games You can call me by the name I gave you yesterday, yeah Every minute counts I don't wanna watch T V anymore, yeah Can you figure me out Just doin' this to waste more time on the couch Can you see me  I'm waiting for the right time I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine Can you see me using everything to hold back I guess this could be worse Walking out the door with your bags Walking out the door with your bags Walking out the door with your bags Walking out the door with your bags Pour your glass of wine Mitchell told me I should be just fine Cases under the bed Spill it open, let it rush to my head I don't wanna be forward, I don't wanna cut corners Savor this with everything I have inside of me I'm not the type to run I know that we're having fun But what's the rush  Kissing, then my cheeks are so flushedSorry I didn't kiss you But it's obvious I wanted to Bubble gum down my throat and it's a curse But my luck couldn't get any worse'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb Pink flowers grow from my skin Pepto Bismol veins and I grin You look so nice in your shirt It's sad because it just hurts I'd do anything for you But would you do that for me, too 'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb Oh, pink flowers grow from my skin Oh, Pepto Bismol veins and I grin Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, ohBetween the gaps, I was swimming laps Got close to some epiphany I'll convince a friend to join deep ends Have your toes touch the lack of cement Gather to one corner of the woods Echo chambers inside a neighborhood And centerfold, humility shown You're not as good as what your mama's sewn Aren't you glad that you reside in a Hell and in disguise Nobody yet everything, a pool to shed your memory Could you say you even tried You haven't called your family twice I can hope tonight goes diffеrently But I show up to the party just to leavе Between the gaps, keep it under wraps How I got to some epiphany I'll convince myself when it turns to twelve The photos keep the sentimentAha, ayy, aha Man, come on, man, don't leave, fuck What the fuck  Why you leave me on read I don't like this, fuck, ahh If I told you what I'm thinkin' 'bout It's hard to say to you, but I just know that I need some time alone It's all I think about at night I need some time away from you Can't even be in the same room I think I'm going crazy Been home and lonely lately What do you think about me Can you fight or will you flee Call me, you got my number Don't let me go yet, lover You're gone, I'm done, I'm all alone You know that I know That you're not comin' home These days, I’m lost, you left me to drown To drownSome things just aren't that simple You called me wondering why I changed Or why I don't look the same Why I think so differently now Is it ever gonna change  Am I gonna feel this way forever Are you gonna be around for me to count on Is it ever gonna change  Am I gonna feel this way forever Are you gonna be around for me to count on  Count on On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on Some things just never seem to fade I'm thinking about how we were on our first date You understood the words I was saying I knew I'd never let you get away Hold you tight, squeeze you right, tell you what I want Put me in your bedroom and I'll sing a little song Hold you tight, squeeze you right, give you all I've got See you in the morning, over coffee, we'll talk, ohHello Are you into me, like I'm into you Do you wanna do the things I wanna do with you You're so close, and yet so far I wonder how you look when you're in the dark You're just one click away, click away, click away From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake You're just one click away, click away, click away From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake Played you D OO M, man, you play Drake You left crumbs all on my face Taste like Ri Ri, taste like Bey Bought you Fenty, took his place Rolled your weed and kissed your face Man, wanna smoke you out like all-day Man, wanna do a quickie in the hallway, can You be all down for the boy, no mass Hot jump, skip rope, twenty-three years old Made a hundred grand and went broke, I'm an asshole Clairo, will you be my real or my fake though Pesos, cashing out checks when I say so Frame my life and take my soul Make me crazy, make me old Save me roses, text my phone Fake like rappers, fake like jokes I knowHere we are, quiet at your kitchen table With courtesy to little pet peeves Napkins on laps, strands pulled back I hang the scarf and my mom's anorak Why do I tell you how I feel When you're just looking down the blouse It's something I wouldn't say out loud If touch could make them hear, then touch me now If touch could make them hear, then touch me now Talking to some who laugh and others scorned I guess humor could help me after all It's funny now, I'm just useless and a whore But I get a cosign from your favorite one-man show Why do I tell you how I feel When you're too busy looking down my blouse It's something I wouldn't say out loud If touch could make them hear, then touch me now If touch could make them hear, then touch me now If touch could make them hear, then touch me now Now
