Tell me what you thought about when you were gone And so alone The worst is over You can have the best of me We got older But we're still young We never grew out of this feeling that we won't give up Here we lay again On two separate beds Riding phone lines To meet a familiar voice And pictures drawn from memory We reflect on miscommunications And misunderstandings And missing each other too Much to have had to let go We turn our music down And we whisper"Say what you're thinking right now"Tell me what you thought about when you were gone And so alone The worst is over You can have the best of me We got older But we're still young We never grew out of this feeling that we won't give upLet's sail away Find our own country We'll build a house and beds out of palm trees Let's get away Let's push our lives aside I'll sport a smile Take in some color Under the stars I'll be your lover With no distractions, I'm gonna treat you right When it seems like things are only getting better When it seems like we can never catch a break Just a keep a hold on me, don't let go If you float away, if you float away Waiting too long for a ship to come Don't you float away, don't you float away Let's go to bed Let's stop debating Look at the time We're always waiting But we're in love And that should be just fineI got the talk when I was younger And understood as I recall They hadn't mentioned this at all My heart was racing like a sprinter That tripped and fell In love with a girl just for tonight and that's all I've got big, big plans And they've got to mean something more Than just once But I just don't know what I want I'm gonna tear your ass up like we just got married And you're all mine now Tonight is the night we've been waiting for all our lives Or maybe for just tonight I got the call when I was older Yeah and I understood If it happens then it happens and that's all My arms the hose and you're the fire Out of control and I've got put you out Before there's nothing left at all I've got big, big plans And they've got to mean something more Than just once But I just don't know what I wantI can't wait for this to end And leave tonight behind us I'm unsettled letting go of you And sleeping the night in silence And this laptop falls along with me Onto my bed while rolling over Break my heart or break my fall Don't kiss him or cover all Memories you had of me The last time I saw you You were standing by his side The last time you saw me Was through your closed eyes as I waited by the phone He loves you Who loves you more To let you go He loves you Who loves you more To let you go I can't wait until my heart mends So I can finally go outside And I tell myself, well Ken It's better to have lost love than Paint a smile and pretendA better slumber Was in your arms Spent tangled up in you A sudden morning Crashed in the room With an uninvited sudden change in you What can I say Where's that girl from last night Who's stuck outside And looks just like you too You can sleep in your own bed tonight Sleep away as summer came screaming out my name You can sleep in your own bed tonight I hope for your sake that you don't wake up as broken as I am For the lack of better Words to say All I said was goodnight Once again, in self defense I won't sleep a wink To prevent dreaming of you You can sleep in your own bed tonight Sleep away as summer came screaming out my name You can sleep in your own bed tonight I hope for your sake that you don't wake up as broken as I am Sleep in your own bed tonight I that some day you will wake up as lonely as I amHere it goes and this won't take long Just let me dedicate a song To a girl who turned this boy to stone And you know who you are Here's a hint, she doesn't have a car Or the time to be in love with me Why did you say This feeling has to stay Left me to wait for so long You don't have to stay But I hoped you would anyway All you did was up and go Excuse me, but this won't take long I'm sorry for writing you this song But just what do you think you deserve Because when you had the chance for romance You burnt it at both ends I guess I'm not sorry in the leastWell I've been given a lot of time To get my life set straight and my head on right I assumed that I could do no harm Until I started to lose my charm I've got to go and put it all away But I can't help but think about it almost everyday I was anxious right before your eyes But I was sure to always wear my smile I know we've only got a lot of pain Cause it's so hard to be a human in so many ways Overthinking most of my life I should be swallowing all of my pride I've had a lifetime to wait Such a magnificent drain on my energy I want another one I'll wait Until the right words fall into place Anyways Anyways Now I've been moaning an entire month Over a couple troubled thoughts I've got to rise above They'd be disappearing with no time If I could only leave my mindGetting close to whatever matters Whatever it happens to be You're thinking to yourself You're thinking to yourself I know you do They used to have you surrounded All the sudden where can we be You left yourself alone You left yourself alone You know you did On hard times, waiting for all our luck to turn Somehow it is On hard times, waiting for all our luck to turn Somehow it is It is!They used to take you for granted Some of it was harder to see You do it to yourself You do it to yourself You know you do, you know you doWhat's my name R-U-L-E Blowing back on mary jane And analyzin' the game The game done chose me To bring the words I can't say, it's one in the same Ever since you told me There's only room for two, I'll be makin' less room for you Only God can hold me Judge me, the only man that help is above me, holla I've met so many men and It's like they're all the same My appetite for lovin'Is now my hunger pain And when I'm feelin' sexy Who's gonna comfort me My only problem is Their insecurities Tired being alone Sick of arguin' on the phone Tellin' all your friends But your man don't understand my loveTell me what you thought about when you were gone And so alone The worst is over You can have the best of me We got older But we're still young We never grew out of this feeling that we won't give up Here we lay again On two separate beds Riding phone lines To meet a familiar voice And pictures drawn from memory We reflect on miscommunications And misunderstandings And missing each other too Much to have had to let go We turn our music down And we whisper"Say what you're thinking right now"Tell me what you thought about when you were gone And so alone The worst is over You can have the best of me We got older But we're still young We never grew out of this feeling that we won't give up
