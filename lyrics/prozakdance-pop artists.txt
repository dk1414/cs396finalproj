You see, every day remains the same for me I often wonder what it takes to just set me free I stare into this dark abyss that I know is my life No where to run, no where to hide, no way to cope or strife And everything I see is drained, all the colors are gone They slowly fade away into the lyrics of the song Searching for sanctuary peace of mind, but something's wrong I lost myself along the way and its been far too long Somebody tell me where's my kindred spirit And all I catch is interference Hoping that someone can hear this I think I'm finally thinking clearest Things will never ever be the same again I hope that you will understand the pain I was in I wanna thank you for the times of being a friend Sorry I've reached the end, maybe I'll see you again Things will never ever be the same again I hope that you will understand the pain I was in I wanna thank you for the times of being a friend Sorry I've reached the end, maybe I'll see you againAfterlife deserved Is it really real anyway Wish I could find a better way That I would lay me down And give my life to you There's nothing left to do The inner story, the purgatory What does it all mean The Good Book says and I don't really think they be wolfin' and if you already get tooken I shook those fears, and I don't really believe and I should, and now the book got me lookin'Seem like some all types of hopes, folks, copes and what they lovin' the most I had the weirdest dreams and guttural screams and demons were seen from coast to coast for the last time, sniff as if you deserve it if you don't know by now, you just made it real permanent inside the golden gate, somewhere everyone hates you ain't no savin', no face or nowhere to escape to Eyes is wide shut but I gotta go visit The automatism, the vision inside of my gut Life is like "what !", whatever you make it Don't waste it 'fore your time is up till the peace of you That you can see knee deep, tryna sweep 'em Keep 'em from peepin' you And when the streetsweep keep Sinkin' 'em, ain't nobody speak of you And that's purgatory Yeah And the question is why Prozak, Saginaw what up Tech N9ne, Kansas City what up Twista, Chi-Town what up And we do it like this How can somebody explain to me Why we been followed by evil for so many centuries Locked in prison the world is a penitentiary Such a catastrophe and it follows our destiny But crackhead mothers and fathers are beating their children Suicide bombers are crashing our planes into buildings While H IV is spreadin' and killin' off millions And down in New Orleans there’s several abandoned civilians They're spillin' the blood of other people for barrels of oil The bodies are burning and scattered all over the soil Feeling the tension as tempers and temperatures boil Strikin' the soul is a serpent that rattles and coils God, tell me what has now became of us Shame on us for becoming a race so dangerous And even with hate in us You never did stray from us Instead of forsaking us You have forgaven us Why Living in these dark times, it’s hard to stop these dark rhymes It seems that we have lost before we’ve even crossed the start line Metaphor for human race what’s in store for heaven’s sakes Watching ourselves dissipate and even worse participate In our own demise think about it read between the lines Damn we must be blind to see the signs we’re almost out of time And reality might not always be what you might hope Sometimes you’re really feeling like you’re walking across a tightrope Above a sea of uncertainty and certainly it hurts worse to be Coerced because of loss of freedom hurts worse than a third degree Burn let the ashes fall yearn pick up the pieces y’all Gotta learn to hear the call turn before you hit the wall Sink or swim make it count Trust your friends when in doubt Make amends take a vow Opposition take them out Never let nothing get between you and your hope and your dreams We’ve suffered long enough now it’s time they hear our screams If we could start all over a million miles from here Could we eliminate the hate inside and all our fears Or would you keep it going our self-inflicted hell We gotta reach for peace before history can repeat itself If we could start all over a million miles from here Could we eliminate the hate inside and all our fears Or would you keep it going our self-inflicted hell We gotta reach for peace before history can repeat itselfOur lives are all about chances and circumstances And hopes that it will advance us Maybe one day we can have the answers What is life, what is death and what comes after that And why do they call life a gift if it gets taken back So contradictive our existence to be specific The need to be prolific Superseeds our goal of coexistence It's kind of ironic fueled by grief of valued possessions And in the end we decompose back to nothing, it's senseless You'd figure by now we would get it, leave it, cease and desist it With every instance exhibit ignorance with persistence Would our creator take credit creating all of us Or would our God rather just refrain and remain anonymous To tired to move on, too far to turn back To late to right wrongs, you better move fast Proverbial sands fall through the hourglass As time becomes our emphasis nemesis as the hours pass We're looking for the savior All alone we roam in the land of the haters Everybody wanna raid us, rape us Forsake us, tame us, man it's so heinous Acts of aggression, blasting the weapon Hey let me ask you a question, will a lack of affection Dissipate, eliminate, obliviate all in reflection Sink back to obscurity straight to the bottom of the depths In this mess of all purity As our insecurities Surely, purposely gotta stop prematurily Ain't nowhere to go but cast down bellow When the flames burn high and your heart has froze cold Never really thought about the path you chose Left to die in misery alone You gotta make a change while you can Because time is flying and it waits for no man Keep sole control of your whole life span And it holds the roll of Psalms in it's right hand Try to make amends make it right with friends Make use of the time you spend And never look back at the past again Can you get your soul back, well it just depends x2 I can see it in your eyes See right through your lies Everything you pretend to be And it comes as no surprise Hater in disguise That you are my enemy Just look at you, I see you staring all green with envy You wishin' upon a star hoping, that one day you can end me Bitch, look deep into my eyes, you don't know truth from lies And it comes as no surprise, I'm not the kind to empathize Retaliation  annihilation A violation guaranteed to make your skull crush A savage assassin, it belongs to a fandom like Manson Attacking at random by sellin' your soul for ransom Tall dark and handsome, 300 pounds and then some I come equipped with 'bout four clip inside of me handgun And if you really want it with me, then you can have some But I suggest you listen to the words inside this anthem So can you back it up, but there's no place you can run Hitchcock of Hip-Hop, lights camera, action!In terms of intellect, it's simple that my shit is pure It makes me wonder how the fuck you got so insecureWe don't ever want no trouble We don't wanna have to fight But disrespect Is unacceptable So it's not our fault after it goes down If you came to us with some bullshit There's no limit to what can happen As the peace barrier has been broken by ignorance People find themselves impaled in hell and it's Evil devouring now there's how they're down there You're in my town nigga!Pick up the pilly and put the hype down nigga!Because you wanna run your mouth Some to the lungs, we killas'll gun you out You better get ghost, backpack You don't want the shit to go brrat cat Your mother put you in a permanent knapsack Because I can't go out like that It'll go down, when a stupid nigga come in your town In a bar with a pocket full of dough now A lot of ho's 'round and he throw frowns Cur with a perv, that is not us Dishonorable nigga, we gonna lock up You don't know, dead bodies 'bout to pop up Steppin' in my face like what Even though the world's around me I feel lonely like I'm the only one Even though the world has found me It can drown me, it feels just like nothing Even though the world's around me I feel lonely like I'm the only one Even though the world has found me It can drown me, it feels just like nothing Maybe there's a reason I feel I'm the only one I walk amongst 7 billion understood by none A lost soul walking down the cross-roads Searching for some sanctury, some peace of mind just to grab hold Man overboard in the darkest sea of reality Desperately trying to keep himself from sinking And he's frantically panicing, there's no sign of land Can he manage to be that man that can handle this damage and get back up on his feet again 'Cause somewhere deep inside his abdomen he feels the burn and purpose to defeat these inner demons that seem to submerge him That always seem to surface and cause a diversion that swerves him to crash and burn on his course to destiny's purpose Even though the world's around me I feel lonely like I'm the only one Even though the world has found me It can drown me, it feels just like nothingYou know it's funny…Every time you get to the last song on your album It kinda makes you wonder like What if this W AS your last song And if it was, then what would you say I close my eyes, but it won’t go away Am I a passenger aboard this life Or am I just a stowaway Sometimes I feel my soul’s a throw away;Inside is so cold and grey Just hope that I can cope and don’t explode today Surrounded by these broken shards from the past I sit and try to analyze these racing thoughts as they pass Friends turn into foes And foes turn into friends It makes you wonder for what purpose we serve All in the end we’re falling And thus continues the cycle of our humanity So hard to watch our dreams just dissipate into reality So this goes out to those who feel like me And refuse to walk the beaten path to fight for their own destiny An alien inside my own skin;No matter what I’ve tried to do in this life, I can’t fit in I know there’s reasons for things and things for reasons The black sheep: alone in this world since I’ve been breathing Alien inside my own skin No matter what I’ve tried to do in this life I can’t fit in I know there’s reasons for things and things for reasons The black sheep: alone in this world since I’ve been breathingPeople tell me that I never really smile maybe If they knew me ever since I was a child they'd be Understanding the reason for my withdrawal lately It's been worse than it has in a long while You see my brain just thinks a lot Often lost in thought Often spaced I just cannot Seem to get it together been losing my patience a lot Hope for the better whatever anything to make it stop If you're feeling like me then you'll understand And if you don't I apologize in advance But on the other hand I don't really give a damn Take it or leave it, I am who I am Just another person trying to find his way Trying to figure it out trying to find my place Either lead, follow or get out of the way Life is too short, too fast to turn the page Turn the page Audio barricade Brea-Breakdown Audio
