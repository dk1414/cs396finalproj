I think it's bad news for the English game We're not creative enough, and we're not positive enough It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming Football's coming home It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming Football's coming home It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming Football's coming home It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming Football's coming home Everyone seems to know the score, they've seen it all before They just know, they're so sure That England's gonna throw it away, gonna blow it away But I know they can play, 'cause I remember Three lions on a shirt Jules Rimet still gleaming Thirty years of hurt Never stopped me dreamingWe still believe, we still believe We still believe, we still believe It's coming home, it's coming home It's coming, football's coming home It's coming home, it's coming home It's coming, football's coming home Tears for heroes dressed in grey No plans for final day Stay in bed, drift away It could have been all songs in the street It was nearly complete, it was nearly so sweet And now I'm singing Three lions on a shirt Jules Rimet still gleaming No more years of hurt No more need for dreaming Talk about football coming home And then one night in Rome We were strong, we had grown And now I see Ince ready for war Gazza good as before, Shearer certain to score And Psycho screamingNighttime slows Raindrops splash rainbows Perhaps someone you know Could sparkle and shine As daydreams slide To colour from shadow Picture the moonglow That dazzles my eyes And I love you Just lying smiling in the dark Shooting stars around your heart Dreams come bouncing in your head Pure and simple every time Now you're crying in your sleep I wish you'd never learnt to weep Don't sell the dreams you should be keeping Pure and simple every time Dream of sights Of sleigh rides in seasons Where feelings not reasons Can make you decide As leaves pour down Splash Autumn on gardens As colder nights harden Their moonlit delights And I love you"I think it's bad news for the English game""We're not creative enough, and we're not positive enough"It's coming home It's coming home It's coming Football's coming

be the guiding light Swim to me through stars that shine down And call to the sleeping world as they fall to Earth So here's your life We'll find our way We're sailing blind But it's certain nothing's certain I don't mind I get the feeling You'll be fine I still believe that In this world We've got to find the time For the life of Riley From cradles to sleepless nights You breathe in life forever And stare at the world from deep under eiderdownYou're lying again Say you don't, but then you do I'm trying again To build a wall around your heart Then break it through to you You make it happen Everything's blue now Oh, lucky you There's nothing to lose And if it's really true Oh, lucky you You're chasing the moon Reaching out to touch the stars But you land too soon What will it take to make you see The way things really are You've got this far So let it happen Everything's blue now Oh, lucky you There's nothing to lose So if it's really true Oh, lucky youI'm flying high on something beautiful and aimless It's got a name but I prefer to call it nameless It comes and goes and leaves me on a bed of splinters Feels like I'm living in a town closed down for winter The taste of love The more you get The more you want And all because The only reason is just because It all makes sense When you're near It all makes sense I'm standing high on tiptoes looking over fences Waiting for somebody like you to kiss me senseless I've had a bellyfull of faces drawn in sadness I want to jump deep into tides of loving madness The taste of love The more you get The more you want And all because The only reason is just because It all makes sense When you're near It all makes senseYou showed me how to do Exactly what you do How I fell in love with you It's true, I love you You showed me how to say Exactly what you say In that very special way It's true, you fell for me too And when I tried it I could see you fall And I decided It's not a trip at all You taught it to me too Exactly what you do And now you love me too It's true, we're in love, we two We're in love, we two We two You showed me how to do Exactly what you do How I fell in love with youThe world is full of fools Who never get it right You don't know what to do So you do anything you like Oh, you're a silly thing You're such a pretty thing You're never going to be like all those fools You're going out tonight There's nothing to lose You're going to give it all a try Don't ever change Don't ever change No, never change Never change You better say your prayers A whisper to the wise And thank your lucky stars For coming out tonightI don't care what songs you sing Or how you think of all those pointless things Sweet nothings what you bring So fly away on sugar coated wings I'm sinking deep, I'm going under That sugar coated iceberg tastes so sweet Until you tumble, those sugar coated lies All those tricky things you said On angel wings they're flying around my head You were cheap but I was sold I should forget you but I won't be told I'm sinking deep, I'm going under That sugar coated iceberg tastes so sweet Until you tumble, those sugar coated lies Sweet and sour, as gold and coal A sugar iceberg stole my soul And hid it deep inside my heart Threw it through me like a poison dart
