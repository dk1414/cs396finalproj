Love to hear itDe mi tierra bella, de mi tierra santa Oigo ese grito de los tambores Y los timbales al cumbanchar Y ese pregón que canta un hermano Que de su tierra vive lejano Y que el recuerdo le hace llorar Una canción que vive entonando De su dolor, de su propio llanto Y se le escucha penar La tierra te duele, la tierra te da En medio del alma cuando tú no estás La tierra te empuja de raíz y cal La tierra suspira si no te ve más La tierra donde naciste No la puedes olvidar Porque tiene tus raíces Y lo que dejas atrás La tierra te duele, la tierra te da En medio del alma cuando tú no estás Siguen los pregones, la melancolía Y cada noche junto a la luna Sigue el guajiro entonando el sonMambo Cabana, oh-oh Mambo Cabana, oh-oh-oh The plane leaves in the morning Soon the world will see you shining And I wish I could go with you But your journey isn't mine And the world will soon adore you As I learn to live without you Every melody is for you Every song I write about you And this fear that keeps me by the door Shouldn't interfere with you wanting more I am here, just on another shore Always in your corner watching you soar When your plane lands on the runway Keep this song inside your heart Oh-oh, when the road goes only one way Keep this song inside your heart Oh-oh, when the years pass but thе love stays Keep this song inside your heart Oh-oh, I'll bе with you when the song plays All along inside your heartHere we are, face to face We forget, time and place Hold me now, don't let go Though it hurts and we both know why The time we spend together's gonna fly And everything you do to me is gonna feel so right Baby when you're loving me I feel like I could cry'Cause there's nothing I can do to keep from loving you Here we are, all alone Trembling hearts, beating strong Reaching out, a breathless kiss I never thought could feel like this I want to stop the time from passing by I wanna close my eyes and feel your lips are touching mine Baby when you're close to me, I want you more each time And there's nothing I can do to keep from loving you There's nothing I can do I'm helpless in your arms Oh baby what you do I'm in love, this is it There's no turning back this time No, no, no1-2-3-4 Come on, baby Say you love me5-6-7 times They tell me you're shy boy But I want you just the same Don't play innocent with me You know it's not just fun and
