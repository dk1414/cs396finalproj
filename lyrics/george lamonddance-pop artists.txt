Magic fills the air whenever you are near I can finally see the mystery of love in your eyes It's got me hypnotized You made me believe our love was meant to be Now somehow things have changed You're mentioning his name But I don't wanna hear That you've let someone new into your heart It's tearing me apart But, darling, I've just got to know Where does that leave love Where does that leave us What about the promises and dreams that mean so much Where does that leave me Living without you How can I go on when you are telling me we're through Darling, if it's true Where does that leave us Where does that leave love Holding back the tears Holding back the fears That you would really go And leave me here to live all alone No meaning in my life Now all that is left is a dream that's half alive I still need you so I just can't let you go Can't you find in me What you have found in somebody new After all that we've been through If I am about to lose youBecause you're bad of the heart How could you be so cruel You treat me like a fool After all I did for you You cut me like a blade My trust is slowly fading Now I don't know what to do I thought that when you came along My life would start to change Instead I saw that I was wrong My life was rearranged How I wonder why You just put my love aside You threw me in the gutter And you left me there to lie Bad of the heart You never wanted to start'Cause you're just bad of the heart You never played the game too smart'Cause you know you're bad When I was by your side You kissed and told me lies You hurt me each and every day I made it through the night Lying to myself Why did it have to be this way It's been so long, girl, since I felt this way So many times you stole my heart away Before I say the things I want to say I need to know that you will be the one for, one for me I'd like to know how far this love will go I want to be the one who's glad to know That this won't only be a memory Just tell me what you see, just what this love can be Just look into my eyes And tell me what you see Promises were broken Now it's you, girl, that I need Just look into my eyes You'll see a rainbow we can share Please don't let this be another lie Just look into my eyes Just look into my eyes As I count the hours of the day Just tell me what I need to hear you say I want to play those games I used to play Baby, can't you see just what you do to, do to me It's hard enough to find a love that's true How heaven knows, girl, I wanted to be with you So now the times I've left it up to you Just open up your heart and, girl, just turn the keyLove can be so right But things can go so wrong The clouds come rolling in Love may not last very long But I know as for me Our love will always be'Cause what we share together Can weather any storm Ooh, I love you, girl We'll get through I promise you No matter what the world may do to us No matter what may try to tear our love apart It won't get through to us We'll never change what's in our hearts No matter what Life can be so hard The world can be so cold And everybody says we won't last But they don't know That for my whole life through I'll keep on loving you You're such a part of me I could never let you goThere's no one who could ever love me like you loved me I remember how it used to be There was no stronger love And now I can't believe I was only too blind to see That your love is inside of me And now I don't have anything at all Every night I think as time just passes by Why I left your love and how it made me cry Now that I find I don't know what to do My life feels so empty, so empty, alone without you Without you, without you I don't know what I'll do without you, girl Without you, my love is in your hands There's nothing left to live for There's nothing left to do without you Every night that I sleep, I sleep with a fantasy That you're here, it's just you and me Just like it always was But then I'm left to see that it was only a memory And what's left is for me to be Alone without your love Every night I think as time just passes by Why I left your love and how it made me cry Now that I find I don't know what to do My life feels so empty, so empty, alone without youBaby, I believe in you Hope that you believe in me, girl Baby, I believe in you And every little thing you do Every time we kiss It always feels like this I believe in you Oh, maybe I might sound crazy For the way I feel about you Baby, you're just so amazing That I'm so in love, girl I believe in you I believe in you There's something about you Baby, I believe in us And every little inch of our trust Whether I'm around You never let me down I believe in youDistant heart, girl, I need you right now Torn apart and I can't live without your love Keep the feeling alive Distant heart, won't you come back to me I don't wanna know why you walked away from me I don't wanna know who's holding you now All I've ever dreamed, girl, and all I'll ever be Lives inside your heart, I've got to make you see If I could, I would be by your side But, girl, you are so far away All I have left is the hole deep inside The miles between us will fade Distant heart, please come back to my side Torn apart, something beautiful's dying Our love, can't we keep it alive Distant heart ?I see you on the street, you stop and say hello Though I try to smile, inside, I'm dying You talk about your life, I'm about to lose control Better get away before the tears begin to fall If I could, I'd find words that would say How your touch makes me feel deep inside Girl, you're so close, but you're so far away I've got to cross over that line, yeahWe got to turn, we got to turn We got to turn, we got to turn We got to turn, we got to turn Turn this world around We got to turn, we got to turn We got to turn, we got to turn We got to turn, we got to turn Turn this world around First start with your own heart Learn to love yourself Then take it over to your next-door neighbor Don't keep it on a shelf Into the street where you can start them singing Yeah, we'll be jamming from New York to England Love's contagious Gotta spread it all around Love's contagious Love's contagious Gonna turn this world aroundCan you see me standing You know my eyes are open wide I've heard people talking They've been keeping me outside I've said don't break my heart You are a part of me Someday I'm sure you'll understand Stop that girl Tell her that my heart's in danger She treats me like a total stranger Stop that girl Even if she says it's over Try to understand and lay it on the line If you hear me calling Will you come into my life Without you, I'm falling And it cuts me like a knife Ooh, these dreams can last forever You will see If she will only change her mindSi pudiera estar contigo para siempre Como estamos hoy, sería una bendición Pero tú te vas, dejándome a mi suerte No me dejes, quiero darte amor No debes irte, debes esperar Tú necesitas conocerme un poco más Saber como soy, sentir mi calor Tú junto a mí, yo junto a ti Yo sé que así puede suceder Que se despierte tu amor por mi Y entrе mis brazos, flotando, el cielo te daré Ooh, еl cielo te daré Estoy convencido que vas a quererme Ya esto lo viví, esto es un déjà vu Para que el amor sea algo intranscendente Pero temes entregarte más No debes irte, debes esperar Tú necesitas conocerme un poco más Saber como soy, sentir mi calor
