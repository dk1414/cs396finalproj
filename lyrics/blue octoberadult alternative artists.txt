I have to block out thoughts of you so I don’t lose my head They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I’m alone Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain An ounce of peace is all I want for you; will you never call again And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face And will you never try to reach me It is I that wanted spaceThere will be days when you're falling down There will be days when you're inside out There will be days when you fall apart Someone else will break your heart They're never gonna hold you back I'm always gonna have your back So try to remember that I hope you're happy I hope you're good I hope you get what you wish for And you're well-understood And now I'm standing here, looking at you I wonder what the hell you're gonna do With those Dr  Pepper eyes and your bubble gum hair Yeah, I'm standing right here I remember how I held you so right I remember that Saturday night Do you There will be days when you're falling down There will be days when you're inside out There will be days when you fall apart Someone else will break your heart They're never gonna hold you back I'm always gonna have your back So try to remember thatI'll smile if I want to I'm not afraid, gonna flaunt it too What a glow when you're living true Yeah I'm living for the right now I had a few friends show me how I take a deep breath and blow it out Let it go But listen, I I can't wait to see what's around the corner I can't wait to soar Baby, I lie awake and I watch you sleeping, thinking It's the little things that make a home Like dancing in the kitchen in the pale moonlight Only care in the world is that our kids are alright Daddy loves momma and momma loves him Tomorrow, we get to do it over again So smile at me, baby, take my breath away With the good Lord willing, I'll be happy to say That daddy loves momma and momma loves him Tomorrow, we get to do it over againI'm just a normal boy That sank when I fell overboard My ship would leave the country But I'd rather swim ashore Without a life vest, I'd be stuck again Wish I was much more masculine Maybe then I could learn to swim Now floating up and down I spin, colliding into sound Like whales beneath me diving down I'm sinking to the bottom of my Everything that freaks me out The lighthouse beam has just run out I'm cold as cold as cold can be Be I want to swim away but don't know how Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean Let the waves up take me down Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah Let the rain of what I feel right now come down Let the rain come downYou wear black hair, I have Blue You look sadder than most girls

underwater All I am, getting harder A heavy weight, I carry around Today I don't have to fall apart I don't have to be afraid I don't have to let the damage consume me My shadows see through me, 'cause Fear in itself, will reel you in and spit you out Over and over again Believe in yourself, and you will walk Fear in itself, will use you up and break you down Like you were never enough I used to fall, now I get back up I'm up here I'm looking at the way down there I'm staring through the I don't care It's staring back at me The beauty is I'm learning how to face my beast Starting now to find some peace Set myself freeThe first time I felt rain The first time I felt pain You took that away The first time you opened up The first time you closed up I feel that everyday I'm sorry for the things I did to you I'm sorry for the shit I put you through Let's go back to when we both knew How to dance in time Maybe in another lifetime I'll find the strength to say these words to you I should've been a better man But a should've could've would've Isn't what a better man would do Sarah my sweet Yeah, Sarah my heart Yeah, Sarah my heart Yeah, ah ah ah ah ah The first time I felt mist The first time that we kissed I want that back again What I'm asking you is hard'Cause I know I broke your heart But if you'll please let me inBack on the train to find me another one Charcoal and steam and you on my mind You see I find you in places like sunsets and melodies In cold winter storms, you're my summer fire But if breathing's harder  as we get farther Forecast weather, divine But if waiting's torture , I'll take another one For you I'll take another one You're still on my mind I'm halfway asleep I feel you right next to me The sound of your heartbeat, keeps me awake Oh baby just as you are, God you're a sight to see And every part of me is wanting you more But if breathing's harder as we get farther Forecast weather, divine But if waiting's torture, I'll take another one For you I'll take another one You're still on my mindYour baby is a monster You don't know the things I've done The sky that I sleep under You don't know what I've become Well, I think of you as comfort I tell my head that's who you are So take another little picture Could you love me Could you love me All in all I'm not the same And I try to tell you everything All of the things I've done But you never come back home All in all I'm not the same And I'm scared to tell you everything All of the things I've done Would you let me come back home I wanna come back home I wanna come back I wanna come back home Oh I need to tell you thank you'Cause I think that you're the one You don't see what goes on in me Or all the damage that I've done
