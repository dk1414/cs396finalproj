I feel sweet Do you feel sweet It's amazing I have no skin And I feel everything It's amazing I feel good When you feel good I knew I would And it's amazing I've wanted this for so long Now the deed has been done We shall rise with the sun And spend our time as one Now there is no sin In anything And it's amazing I love life I hope you do too'Cause I love everything It's all amazing I feel new Do you feel new I understand When they say we're born again'Cause I feel born again I'm born again And it's amazing And it's the best thing And it's glorious It's life changing This feeling Is amazing It's the best thing It's glorious It's life changing This feelingYou've been my queen for longer than you know My love for you has been Every step I take, every day I live, everything I see And if I get things wrong Don't want you to think that I'm running away But I heard from Jo about this guy and I want to know What did he say He called me baby, baby, all night long What did he do He called me baby, baby, all night long Why  Why  Why did you need him  Where was I Just how close to you is he Every smile you gave, every touch you made, every word you said And it hurts beyond hurt It was a love that blinds and a love that stings When I heard from Jo about this guy and I want to know What did he say He called me baby, baby, all night long What did he do He called me baby, baby, all night longYou might not be the chosen one Still you wait for your time to come Still your faith has taken a tumble And your pride is shaken and humble now You must know nothing's set in stone You must know that you're not alone Try not to ever hate But can't help but over compensate There's a smile says everything's rosy Maybe ten percent that it's mostly hell You must know nothing's set in stone You must know that you're not alone You dream of another world Where the guy always gets the girl But your life is not like the movies You can shoot your way to heroes should we Some time for the underdog We should take some time for the underdog The calm ones who get it done And it's the brave that will overcome Should you listen to your voices When they lie And give you no more choices Frame what you gonna do In this phase that you going throughSlip off my skin-fall into bed, I'm stayin' in With you-with you inside my head Mail me a sample-phone me a kiss-I'm in a dream Get me out of this And of all the creatures under the sky There is you and I, you and I You and I, you and I It's all too much, you're in every little thing I touch It's all too real, you're in every little thing I feel It's all such a waste, you're in everything I taste Come on, come on Come on, come on Be strong Think of a time-you name the place I'll close my eyes...we're face To face-I see your smile, I feel your kiss I'm in a dream, get me out of this The only thing I've never tried Is leaving here and suicide And of all the creatures under the sky There is you and I, you and I You and I, you and IOne eskim O -
