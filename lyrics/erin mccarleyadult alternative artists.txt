I hate it I wonder where you're drinking some tequila combination The color I illuminate I can feel it fading I'm gonna lose it I hear the thunder I'm not over you I'm not over you I'm not over you I'm not over you Over you I'm breaking down Bleeding out I heard about it Who is she Driving myself crazy I've got lightning inside me I fear I'm gonna lose it What if I can't wake upI dug the moon into the ground Turned this bedroom upside down tonight Took my faith and I breathed it out Walked right through a cloud of flashing lights Bright lights Pain takes my heart's place The love we made, we can't erase it Don't wanna face it Pitter pat, the angel on my shoulder Is haunting me tonight Tick tock, the clock is getting louder Ready for me to decide I've lost my sense of right and wrong Well justified my soul to carry on It feels so damn good to write off the rules But when a new day breaks I'm left a fool I'm such a fool Pain takes my heart's place Your sweet, sweet love, oh I can taste it But still can't face it Pitter pat, the angel on my shoulder Is haunting me tonight Tick tock, the clock is getting louder Ready for me to decideHard to grip what we're in This new reality Red eyes; strong neck We came too far to sit back Swallow  hollow  words  lie I sink into your quicksand Get it outta my throat But I want I want I want I wanna be sexy  electric  respected I wanna be taken to that highest place Where no one's gonna bring me down Ooo higher oh I wanna be sexy  Electric  Respect  Respect  Respected See through fake shit Expose struggle Struggle Swallow  hollow  words  lie I sink into your quicksand Get it outta my throat But I want, I want, I want I wanna be sexy  electric  respected I wanna be taken to that highest place Where no one's gonna bring me down Ooo higher oh I wanna be Sexy  Electric  Respect  Respect  RespectedI cannot begin to even understand Those tears in your eyes took you by surprise Nothing I could say can make it go away I know it's hard to sleep, you can lay your head on me It's okay to cry How can I let you know I got love, I got you, love I'll never go away, I'll never go away I got love, I got you, love I'll never go away, I'll never go away I know you never thought you could hurt this much Losing what you love, you lost yourself, you're numb Even though it's dark, there's a light somewhere inside you Let me hold your hands, I'll help you find your feet again It's okay to cry Want me to let you know I got love, I got you, love I'll never go away, I'll never go away I got love, I got you, love I'll never go away, I'll never go away I got love, I got you, love I'll never go away, I'll never go away I got love, I got you, love I'll never go away, I'll never go awayCome on, come on Put your hands into the fire Explain, explain As I turn and meet the power This time, this time Turning white and senses dying Pull up, pull up From one extreme to another From the summer to the spring From the mountain to the air From samaritan to sin And it's waiting on the air Come on, come on Put your hands into the fire Explain, explain As I turn and meet the power This time, this time Turning white and senses dying Pull up, pull up From one extreme to another
