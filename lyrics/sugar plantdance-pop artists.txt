Everytime I sing a song, I wish it rains'Cause I need you to keep me sane Here rain comes You make me lighter I can run higher Up to the sky where I'm covered with the light When I see a spiral in the mirror I found that something's going down Here rain comes You make me lighter I can run higher Up to the sky where I'm covered with the lightYou and I like the cats We lay together and smoke all day You and I have same faces We dream together and trip all day The great sun cures us So we need no synapse The stars are moving fast So we need no synapseYou don't know how much cold my limb is Do you make me warm in your wings I wish you to see the stars in my mind And do you make me warm I know everyone won't talk about Eating those stars, sweet sweet stars Let me taste yours I know everyone won't be killed Suddenly by thunder But I like it so muchPale blue light is my friend Where is my quiet bed Heavy head makes me down, so down I hate morningLet me catch your eyes Let me touch your face When have we forgot Saying so Might have left some precious thing But I have something better now I don't know how I can Prove this If I were simple I'd wait for forgiveness If I were simple I would smile to you and cry for joy Let me catch your eyes Let me touch your face I believe one day I might get it If I were simple I'd wait for forgiveness If I were simple I would smile to you and cry for joySo far away, you just in my mind So far away, you sing just on my C DI heard you're crossed in love So let me talk about my cross with the strings And drive me to Ohio See black bubble gum I puff out with the cross Is like a darkness after the light you smoke And tastes licoriceHave you ever been under the water I'm so afraid I couldn't find time The only thing I see is a memory I cannot change Have you ever seen the world in the sea I'm so afraid I couldn't find me The only thing I want is an entity I can touch and feel I wanna rise to the surface I wanna rise to be born, not to die I wanna rise just to see you I've got to rise to prove it I gotta riseEverytime I sing a song, I wish it rains'Cause I need you to keep me sane Here rain comes You make me lighter I can run higher Up to the sky where I'm covered with the light When I see a spiral in the mirror I found that something's going down Here rain comes You make me lighter I can run higher Up to the sky where I'm covered with the light
