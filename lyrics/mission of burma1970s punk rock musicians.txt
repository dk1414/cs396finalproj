Walk into my room Ask me jerky questions Don't mean what you say Immaculate protection Play by the rules So close to the vest Hope that all's not lost And this is not a waste Stay just as far from me As me from you Make sure that you are sure Of everything I do'Cause I'm not not not not not not not not Your academy Your academy The halls smell like piss The rooms are underlit Still it must be nice
