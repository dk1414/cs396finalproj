just living to be heard Future generations, riding on the highways that we built I hope they have a better understanding Going to work on Monday Got yourself a family All utility bills have been paid You can't tell your best buddy that you love him Where does our time go Got a brand new house in escrow Sleeping with your back to your loved one This is all that we've learned about happiness Forgot to say hello to my neighbors Sometimes I question my own behavior Talking about the girls that we've seen on the sly Just to tell our souls we're still the young lions Getting too drunk on Saturdays Playing football with the kids on Sundays Soaring with the eagles all week long And this is all that we've learned about living This is all that we've learned about livingWell, I was born in a small town And I live in a small town Probably die in a small town Oh, those small communities All my friends are so small town My parents live in the same small town My job is so small town Provides little opportunity Educated in a small town Taught to fear Jesus in a small town Used to daydream in that small town Another boring romantic, that's me But I've seen it all in a small town Had myself a ball in a small town Married an L.A  doll and brought her to this small town Now she's small town just like me No, I cannot forget from where it is that I come from I cannot forget the people who love me

And I come out grinnin'Well, I fight authority, authority always wins I call up my preacher I say, "Give me strength for round 5."He said, "You don't need no strength, you need to grow up son."I said, "Growin' up leads to growin' old and then to dyin'Ooo, and dyin' to me don't sound like all that much fun."And so I'll say I fight authority, authority always wins Well, I fight authority, authority always wins Well, I've been doing it since I was a young kid I come out grinnin'Well, I fight authority, authority always winsScarecrow on a wooden cross Blackbird in the barn Four hundred empty acres That used to be my farm Grew up like my daddy did My grandpa cleared this land When I was five I walked the fence while Grandpa held my hand Rain on the scarecrow Blood on the plow This land fed a nation This land made me proud And son, I`m just sorry There`s no legacy for you now Rain on the scarecrow Blood on the plow Rain on the scarecrow Blood on the plow The crops we grew last summer
