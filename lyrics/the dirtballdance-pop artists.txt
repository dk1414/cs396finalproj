mushrooms all done with my mind Shrooms I won't decline, wash them down with wine My life goes better with a mushroom I seem like I'm in a better mood when I'm on a mushroom Clouded up when I'm packing a boom clack, clack, kaboom Get the maniac sounds of I wanna fucking shrooma It's bound to do ya, all I gotta say is oh no I'm staring at a gobo But it ain't my name I don't know my name so Why the fuck am I even tryna get a witness Nobody hangin' out with a weird muothafucker like this Like this, everybody make a fist That be the size of the shroom that I ate I am so high that I intoxicate, anybody looking at me in another way Gonna get a watermelon thrown at them, yep, yep I got em Oh f*ck can't feel my nose I can't feel my toes I'm gonna lay down on them, I'm in a full meltdown tripping on the way The tree blows and the way the wind caught them It's time to come to grips I got a long time til I hit bottom, bottom Bottoming out on the trip and psychotically flowing on all the ju ju I'm not them, I'm proud enough to get up out of this chair I'm proud enough to stop pulling my hair I'm proud enough to get another mushroom outta my backpack Yo sitting right there, gonna sit back close my eyes For I gotta get a move on back to life This is the re-up and now is the time Mushrooms on my mindWell good morning my friends, today we shall discuss the mushrooms  How

strong, I know that I must She the goods, need the perfection, the perfect selection Crafted by my hand and you won’t see no protesting Cause all the neighbours know I make a mean batch They swill it
