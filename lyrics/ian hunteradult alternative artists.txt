Well the times gettin' hard for you little girl I'm a hummin' and a strummin' all over God's world You don't remember when you got your last meal And you forgot just how a woman feels You didn't know what Rock 'n' Roll was Until you met a drummer on a Greyhound bus I got there in the nick of time Before he got his hands across your state line Well in the middle of the night on the open road And the heater don't work and it's oh-so cold You're gettin' tired, you're lookin' kinda beat The music of the street, drive you off your feet You didn't know how rock 'n' roll looked Until you caught your sister with a guy from the group Half-way home in the parking lot By the look in her eyes she was givin' what she got Once bitten twice shy, babe Once bitten twice shy, babe Once bitten twice shy, babeThree, four Three, four Three, four All this energy calling me Back where it comes from It's such a crude attitude It's back where it belongs All the little kids growing up on the skids Go Cleveland rocks!Cleveland rocks!Jumping Jene Jene is movie James Dean Starring Cleveland rocks!Cleveland rocks!Cleveland rocks!Cle-eveland rocks!Cleveland rocks!Cleveland rocks!Cleveland rocks!Cle-eveland rocks When I was just sixteen I stood waiting for a dream At Barker Street bus station every night When I tried to get it on she just looked at me with scorn My courage turned to dust and I took flight For those looks they seemed to say you ain't nothing, go away You're just a face in the crowd so I went home and I vowed I'm gonna be somebody someday Her name was Irene Wilde, oh such beauty for a child When she started dating boys I nearly died For I could not barely stand seeing someone hold her hand I felt I had to crawl away and hide Oh in my mother's living room I composed so many tunes All the same, just a frame for her name, and just to say I'm gonna be somebody someday Wilde as your name, I soon left that country town I been around, I've seen some fame, seen some ups and seen some downs Smile through your shock as you hear your name aloud It's that face in the crowd, I didn't dig it, much too proud When I was just sixteen, I stood waiting for a queen A Barker Street bus station non-affair At the time it seemed so sad, but it did not turn out bad If you hadn't messed me up I'd still be there And I think most folks agree, a little put-down makes them see They ain't no chain, they're just a link and that's why you made me think Gonna be somebody, be somebody Be somebody somedayWe used to call it Camelot With all them ladies of Shalott The people liked to Lancelot At the Bed of Roses And what went on behind the scenes Was way beyond your wildest dreams Life was burstin' at the scenes In the Bed of Roses And the band played all night long The band played all night long Song after song after song after song In the Bed of Roses The boy stood on the burning deck The strap was buriеd 'round my neck My fingers bleeding on the frеts At the Bed of Roses We slept on blankets on the floor A grumbling drummer saddle sore Seven hours and sometimes more At the Bed of Roses And the lamps sway side to side The lamps sway side to side If the lamps don't sway you just died At the Bed of RosesGenocidal tendencies are silly to extreme After all you're still quite small you don't know where you've been You was only swearing yesterday Oh you want to win the world away But now you got nothing to say-ay-ay Boy you're getting out of hand You've got to make a stand So put the coke away Boy you got to do the show Got to let the people know You've got the strength to stay I can see you run I can see you hide Oh your heart is aching Lost in a dream of what might have been You're the guide You're the number one And your knees are shaking Stand and deliver in an endless dream Schizophrenic, photogenic, aggravates me so Only yes-men Have a guess man Watch the spirit go Batman zips the monster as he bleeds And gets off on the buzz he needs And a kid on the street just reads And reads and reads and reads And reads and reads and readsSee lonely shadows Silver needles Abandoned in the evening war Lost children of the night Come catch the candles bright I hear a hollow sound Falling to the ground She's lost before she's found Sad broken angels taking rainbows Out on the street for all to see If we are the chosen few Whatever happened to All those things we knew If this is being free I'd rather search for me You nearly did You nearly did You nearly did You nearly did me in You nearly did You nearly did You nearly did You nearly did me in You nearly did You nearly did You nearly did You nearly did me in I need some place to lay My weary anger downSomething is happening, Mr Jones My brother says you're better than the Beatles or the Stones Saturday night and Sunday morning You turned us into heroes, can you hear the heroes sing ?Dandy, you're the prettiest star There ain't no life on Mars but we always thought there might be Dandy, you opened up the door You left us wanting more, and then we took the last bus home Who let the genie outta the lamp And little Lord Fauntleroy, who let him out of his amp Saturday night and Sunday morning Well Trevor's getting bolder, and Woody loves to hit things Dandy, this world was black and white You showed us what it's like to live inside a rainbow Dandy, you thrilled us to the core You left us wanting more, and then we took the last bus home You beat up Goliath, you had it all The voice, the look, the songs that shook The gift of the gab and the gall Saturday night, Sunday morning When all we had to look forward to was the weekend You made our lives worth livingBilly said this town is dying It's dying just to be like me He was fighting everything in sight Died when he was 23 I used to meet him down at his cafe He had one eye on the door And the other on the writing on the wall He'd get restless and angry and we'd all laugh'cause we weren't really scared We was his friends, he wouldn't hurt us at all And all he'd say was rain, rain, rain Rain, rain, rain Rain, rain, rain Rain, rain, rain We gotta leave this town And Glover was a dancer Imitating Eddie Cochran by the jukebox In the corner of the room'till he was lost Barry 'n me, we used to escape, playing I Go Ape Wearing Italian clothes drinking cider talking in the blues Hey babe, come over here, let me buy you a beer, what's your name She said "Boy, it doesn't really matter, don't you see You ain't what I want, you ain't what I need You ain't what I fancy, you ain't what I dream of" 'n I'd silently agree—he was ugly!Rain, rain, rain Rain, rain, rain Rain, rain, rain Rain, rain, rain I gotta leave this placeHunter Up in the morning, unsteady on my feet I can't seem to focus, didn't get much sleep last night Look in the mirror, what do I see There's a ghostly shadow of a man starring back at me I'm the one that walked away from love Couldn't take that chance, I don't know what I was thinking of But if you want to know what love is If you want to know what love is These are my arms, these are my legs These are my thoughts running around in my head I want to be where you are, I want to do what you do'Cause nothing really matters but you You are my illness, you are my disease You're up there on that pedestal and I'm down here on my knees You are my obsession, every waking hour All I do is think of you, wondering where you are I'm the one watching from a distance, can't believe You're smiling without me If you want to know what love is If you want to know what love isWell the times gettin' hard for you little girl I'm a hummin' and a strummin' all over God's world You don't remember when you got your last meal And you forgot just how a woman feels You didn't know what Rock 'n'
