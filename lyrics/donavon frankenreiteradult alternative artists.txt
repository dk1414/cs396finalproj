what we are We are justJust say what's on your mind What'cha know about love You said our love would be You said you were my girlfriend Some girl you turned out to be I guess you know about leaving Loving and leaving me You left me for no reason But you led me to believe Sometimes your life can crumble Sometimes your soul might make a stumble But you can't drown in your sorrow Cause you might be found You might be found tomorrow What'cha know about living When you've been treated like a queen But a queen don't know about giving I ain't looking to receive Sometimes your life can crumble Sometimes your soul might make a stumble But you can't drown in your sorrow Cause you might be found You might be found tomorrowI never thought it'd happen to me I've been looking all my life just to be Be next to someone I could call my own You know it feels so good not to be alone But you know I never Thought I would find A girl like you I could call all mine I said I never Thought I would find A girl like you I could call all mine My girl's just so sweet I never thought I could ever meet But now it's you I can't live without If you ever left I'd be down and out But you know I never Thought I would find A girl like you I could call all mine I said I never Thought I would find A girl like you I could call all mine I'd call all mineYou and I, girl, are like a sun and moon Lately you ve

what they wanted and fake it They said they'd be shocked if I could find another place to go And you know they said if I left I'd just be all left alone And then a friend said Don't stop doing what you belive in Don't let them put you on a shelf You've got to move by yourself, move by yourself tonight You've got to move by yourself, move by yourself tonight Sometimes they can't forget Forget just what you've got But don't ever be no, no Somebodu that you're not When there's a choice you've got to make Do what you feel, don't hesitate You know I will never, never forget what a friend said
