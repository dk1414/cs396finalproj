'Nother'Nother'Nother You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down You, you enchant me even when you're not around If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down I'm latching on, babe, now I know what I have found I feel we're close enough I wanna lock in your love I think we're close enough Could I lock in your love, baby Now I've got you in my space I won't let go of you Got you shackled in my embrace I'm latching on to you Now I've got you in my space I won't let go of you Got you shackled in my embrace I'm latching on to youI'm feeling something, something different When you left, my picture changed I was blinded, I'd not envisioned The same face in a different frame It's an omen, caught my baby crying Saw the silver lining It must be an omen Needed you to show me, without you I am lonely My mind would rule my heart I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark It left me torn apart But now I see your tears as an omen Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, omen You were waiting, I was vacant You left before  my eyes Then it hit me, you're relocating And I need you by my sideNever really felt bad about it As we drank deep from the lie'Cause I felt melting magnets, babe The second I saw you through half-shut eyes Smoke and sunset, off Mulholland He was talking, I was wonderin' 'bout You and that girl, she your girlfriend Face from heaven, bet the world she don't know Pretty girls don't know the things that I know Walk my way, I'll share the things that she won't Uh-oh, dancing past the point of no return Let go, we can free ourselves of all we've learned I love this secret language that we're speakin'Say it to me, let's embrace the point of no return Let's embrace the point of no return Let's embrace the point of no return Never really thought we would make it We be thinking about what could have been But we've had a record summer, can't turn it down, oh Now I don't wanna see the end beginGonna be you and me It's gonna be everything you You've ever dreamed It's gonna be who and me It's gonna be everything Gonna be you and me Gonna be everything you You've ever dreamed Gonna be who and me Gonna be everything Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh Be, eh, eh Have you gone off your love Eh-eh, eh-eh Have you gone off your love Eh-eh, eh-eh Have you gone off your love Eh-eh, eh-eh Have you gone off your loveTalk to me, and watch me crumble You will see me come undone Faithfully I will look over There I'll find what you've become You help me lose my mind And you bring me something I can't define Help me lose my mind Make me wonder what I felt before Keep biding my time How much longer have I been waiting for Jealousy will be washed over Carefully we will come through Could it be easy to start over Somehow I will bring you to You help me lose my mind And you bring me something I can't define Help me lose my mind Make me wonder what I felt before Keep biding my time How much longer have I been waiting for When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread She gon' bring that attitude home Who don't wanna do nothing with their life When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread She gon' bring that attitude home Who don't

So you've got your love locked up instead But somethin' better's waitin' at your door You don't know your worth All the things I know that you deserve Say it's not real if it doesn't hurt Find someone you know will put you first Find someone who loves you at your worst Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up Who puts you first Find someone who loves you at your worst Don't forget the words I said Picking you up when you're feelin' down You get strung on thoughts left in your head When you lose hope, soon you will be foundStreet lights, turn on one by one My hope is, descending like the sun Try to tell myself there's freedom in the loneliness Always restless, story of my life Disconnected, body clock's not right Try to tell myself that I'mma get some sleep tonight Found myself where I started, this isn't where I want to be The time that I find hardest, always comes eventually My shadow doesn't show in the dark The night time is inclined to my heart The emptiness I felt from the start Will follow me 'till I fall apart Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal My demons are blocking out the light And my mind is about to lose the fight Why can't I find peace, when a caracal could sleep tonight  Your absence isn't something that I choose But the truth is you were never mine to lose Spending half my life just tryna get away from you I’ll be giving up, oh Home is where the heart is And I gave it to you in a paper bag Even though it’s tarnished You told me it’s the best you ever had You got my secret combination And I don’t be giving that out easily With my deepest dedication You can tell that you were brought the same for me So please don’t let go, cause you know exactly what we found So please don’t let go my darling You keep me locked up underground It’s gonna be you and me It’s gonna be everything you’ve ever dreamed It’s gonna be who and me It’s gonna be everything and everything, we’re meant to be We’re meant to be Rolling with the punches So they won’t get inside our happiness Love is always hunted But your arrows are soaring through my chest Cause you know you give me something Yeah you give me exactly what I need Got my blood pumping You know you always draw more blood, I bleed'Nother'Nother'Nother You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down You, you enchant me even when you're not around If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down I'm latching on, babe, now I know what I have found I feel we're close enough I wanna lock in your love I think we're close enough Could I lock in your love, baby Now I've got you in my space I won't let go of you Got you shackled in my embrace I'm latching on to you Now I've got you in my space I won't let go of you Got you shackled in my embrace I'm latching on to you
