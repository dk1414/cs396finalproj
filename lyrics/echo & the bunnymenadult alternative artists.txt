Under blue moon I saw you So soon you'll take me Up in your arms too late to beg you Or cancel it, though I know it must be The killing time Unwillingly mine Fate Up against your will Through the thick and thin He will wait until You give yourself to him In starlit nights I saw you So cruelly you kissed me Your lips a magic world Your sky all hung with jewels The killing moon Will come too soon Fate Up against your will Through the thick and thin He will wait until You give yourself to himCutter Cutter Cutter Who's on the seventh floor Brewing alternatives What's in the bottom drawer Waiting for things to give Spare us the cutter Spare us the cutter Couldn't cut the Mustard Conquering myself until I see another hurdle approaching Say we can, say we will Not just another drop in the ocean Come to the free for all With Sellotape and knives Some of us six feet tall We will escape our liesJimmy Brown, made of stone Charlie Clown, no way home Bring on the dancing horses Headless and all alone Shiver and say the words Of every lie you've heard First I'm gonna make it Then I'm gonna break it Till it falls apart Hating all the faking And shaking while I'm breaking Your brittle heart Billy stands all alone Sinking sand, skin and bone Bring on the dancing horses Wherever they may roam Shiver and say the words Of every lie you've heard First I'm gonna make it Then I'm gonna break it Till it falls apart Hating all the faking And shaking while I'm breaking Your brittle heartShe floats like a swan Grace on the water Lips like sugar, lips like sugar Just when you think you've caught her She glides across the water She calls for you tonight To share this moonlight You'll flow down her river She'll ask and you'll give her Lips like sugar Sugar kisses Lips like sugar Sugar kisses She knows what she knows I know what she's thinking Sugar kisses, sugar kisses Just when you think she's yours She's flown to other shores To laugh at how you break And melt into this lakeI want it now I want it now Not the promises of what tomorrow brings I need to live in dreams today I'm tired of the song that sorrow sings And I want more than I can get Just trying to, trying to, trying to forget I'd walk to you through rings of fire And never let you know the way I feel Under skin is where I hide The love that always gets me on my knees And I want more than I can get Just trying to, trying to, trying to forget Nothing ever lasts forever Nothing ever lasts forever Nothing ever lasts forever Nothing ever lasts forever I want it now I want it now Don't tell me that my ship is coming in Nothing comes to those who wait Time's running out the door, you're running inIn an ice-capped fire Of burning wood In our world of wire Ignite our dreams Of starry skies And you and me As realized Our bigger themes Oh, take me internally Forever yours Nocturnal me Take me internally Forever yours Nocturnal me Do or die What's done is done True beauty lies On the blue horizon Who or why What's one is one In pure disguise Of vulgar sonsAll at sea again And now my hurricanes have brought down this ocean rain To bathe me again My ship's a-sail Can you hear its tender frame Screaming from beneath the waves Screaming from beneath the waves All hands on deck at dawn Sailing to sadder shores Your port in my heavy storms Harbours the blackest thoughts I'm at sea again And now your hurricanes have brought down this ocean rain To bathe me again My ship's a-sail Can you hear its tender frame Screaming from beneath the waves Screaming from beneath the waves...All hands on deck at dawn Sailing to sadder shores Your port in my heavy storms Harbours the blackest thoughtsI chop and I change and the mystery thickens There's blood on my hands and you want me to listen To brawn and to brain when the truth's in the middle Born of the grain like all good riddles B-b-burn the skin off and climb the roof top Thy will be done B-b-bite the nose off and make it the most of Your king- kingdom kingdom kingdom You kill when you talk and the enemy weakens Your words start to walk when you're not even speaking If my heart is a war its soldiers are bleeding If my heart is a war its soldiers are dead B-b-b-burn the skin off and climb the roof top Thy will be done B-b-bite the nose off and make it the most of Your king- kingdom kingdom kingdom Do do do do do do do, do do do do do do do Do do do do do do do, do do do do do do do Do do do do do do do, do do do do do do do Do do do do do do do, do do do do do do doAh ah, ah ah Ah ah, ah ah You set my teeth on edge You set my teeth on edge You think you're a vegetable Never come out of the fridge C-c-c-cucumber C-c-c-cabbage C-c-c-cauliflower Men on Mars April showers Oh oh, oh oh You are a dying breed You are a dying breed You once was an Inca Now you're a Cherokee C-c-c-cucumber C-c-c-cabbage C-c-c-cauliflower Men on Mars April showersIf I said I'd lost my way Would you sympathize Could you sympathize I'm jumbled up Maybe I'm losing my touch I'm jumbled up Maybe I'm losing my touch But you know I didn't have it anyway Won't you come on down to my Won't you come on down to my rescue Things are wrong Things are going wrong Can you tell that in a song I don't know what I want, anymore First I want a kiss and then I want it all Won't you come on down to my Won't you come on down to my rescue Rescue, rescue, rescue
