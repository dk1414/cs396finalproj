Look inside, look inside your tiny mind Then look a bit harder'Cause we're so uninspired, so sick and tired Of all the hatred you harbour So you say it's not okay to be gay Well, I think you're just evil You're just some racist who can't tie my laces Your point of view is medieval Fuck you , fuck you very, very much'Cause we hate what you do And we hate your whole crew So please, don't stay in touch Fuck you , fuck you very, very much'Cause your words don't translate And it's getting quite late So please, don't stay in touch Do you get, do you get a little kick out of being small minded You want to be like your father, it's approval you're after Well, that's not how you find it Do you, do you really enjoy living a life that's so hateful 'Cause there's a hole where your soul should be You're losing control of it And it's really distastefulOh, he treats me with respect He says he loves me all the time He calls me fifteen times a day He likes to make sure that I'm fine You know I've never met a man Who's made me feel quite so secure He's not like all them other boys They're all so dumb and immature There's just one thing that's getting in the way When we go up to bed you're just no good, it's such a shame I look into your eyes, I want to get to know you And then you make this noise and it's apparent it's all over It's not fair and I think you're really mean I think you're really mean, I think you're really mean Oh, you're supposed to care, but you never make me scream You never make me scream Oh, it's not fair and it's really not okay It's really not okay, it's really not okay Oh, you're supposed to care, but all you do is take Yeah, all you do is takeI suppose I should tell you what this bitch is thinking You'll find me in the studio and not in the kitchen I won't be bragging 'bout my cars or talking 'bout my chains Don't need to shake my ass for you 'cause I've got a brain If I told you 'bout my sex life, you'd call me a slut When boys be talking 'bout their bitches, no one's making a fuss There's a glass ceiling to break, uh-huh, there's money to make And now it's time to speed it up 'cause I can't move at this pace Sometimes, it's hard to find the words to say I'll go ahead and say them anyway Forget your balls and grow a pair of tits It's hard, it's hard It's hard out here for a bitch It's hard for a bitch For a bitch, it's hard It's hard out here for a bitch It's hard for a bitch For a bitch, it's hard It's hard out here If you're not a size six, then you're not good-looking Well, you better be rich or be real good at cooking You should probably lose some weight'Cause we can't see your bones You should probably fix your face or you'll end up on your own Don't you want to have somebody who objectifies you Have you thought about your butt  Who's gonna tear it in two We've never had it so good, uh-huh We're out of the woods And if you can't detect the sarcasm, you've misunderstoodWhen you first left me I was wantin' more But you were fucking that girl next door What'cha do that for  When you first left me I didn't know what to say I never been on my own that way Just sat by myself all day I was so lost back then But with a little help from my friends I found a light in the tunnel at the end Now you're calling me up on the phone So you can have a little whine and a moan And it's only because you're feelin' alone At first, when I see you cry Yeah, it makes me smile Yeah, it makes me smile At worst, I feel bad for a while But then I just smile I go ahead and smileBeen here before, so I'm prepared Not gonna lie, though; I'm kinda scared Lace up my gloves, I'm going in Don't let my kids watch me when I get in the ring I'll take the hits, roll with the punches I'll get back up, it's not as if I've never done this But, then again, the game is changing Can't just come back, jump on the mic, and do the same thing There goes the bell, I know that sound I guess it's time for me to go another round Oh, wish me luck, I'm gonna need it I'll see you on the other side if I'm still breathing Ri Ri isn't scared of Katy Perry's roaring Queen B's going back to the drawing Lorde smells blood, yeah, she's about to slay you Kid ain't one to fuck with when she's only on her debut We're all watching Gaga, L OL like haha Dying for the art, so really, she's a martyr And second best will never cut it for the divas Give me that crown, bitch I wanna be Sheezus I'm ready for all the comparisons I think it's dumb, and it's embarrassing I'm switching off, no longer listening I've had enough of persecution and conditioning Maybe it's an instinct, we're only animal Maybe it's healthy, maybe it's rational It makes me angry, I'm serious But, then again, I'm just about to get my period Periods, we all get periods Every month, yo, that's what the theory is It's human nature, another cycle Be nice to me, I'll make you one of my disciplesI wanna be rich and I want lots of money I don't care about clever, I don't care about funny I want loads of clothes and fuckloads of diamonds I heard people die while they're trying to find them And I'll take my clothes off and it will be shameless'Cause everyone knows that's how you get famous I'll look at The Sun and I'll look in The Mirror I'm on the right track, yeah, I'm on to a winner I don't know what's right and what's real anymore And I don't know how I'm meant to feel anymore And when do you think it will all become clear 'Cause I'm being taken over by the fear Life's about film stars and less about mothers It's all about fast cars and cussing each other But it doesn't matter 'cause I'm packing plastic And that's what makes my life so fucking fantastic And I am a weapon of massive consumption And it's not my fault, it's how I'm programmed

I felt the earth beneath my feet Sat by the river and it made me complete Oh simple thing, where have you gone I'm getting tired and I need someone to rely on I came across a fallen tree I felt the branches of it looking at me Is this the place we used to love Is this the place that I've been dreaming of Oh simple thing, where have you gone I'm getting old and I need something to rely on And if you have a minute why don't we go Talk about it somewhere only we know This could be the end of everything So why don't we go Somewhere only we know Somewhere only we knowOh, oh deary me My little brother's in his bedroom smoking weed I tell him he should get up 'cause it's nearly half past three He can't be bothered 'cause he's high on T HC I ask him very nicely if he'd like a cup of tea I
