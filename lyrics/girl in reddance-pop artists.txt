I've been hiding for so long These feelings, they're not gone Can I tell anyone Afraid of what they'll say So I push them away I'm acting so strange They're so pretty, it hurts I'm not talking 'bout boys, I'm talking 'bout girls They're so pretty with their button-up shirts I shouldn't be feeling this But it's too hard to resist Soft skin and soft lips I should be into this guy But it's just a waste of time He's really not my type I know what I like No, this is not a phase Or a coming of age This will never change They're so pretty, it hurts I'm not talking 'bout boys, I'm talking 'bout girls They're so pretty with their button-up shirts They're so pretty, it hurts I'm not talking 'bout boys, I'm talking 'bout girls They're so pretty with their button-up shirtsOh, Hannah, I wanna feel you close Oh, Hannah, come lie with my bones Oh, Hannah, don't look away Oh, Hannah, just look at me the same I don't wanna be your friend, I wanna kiss your lips I wanna kiss you until I lose my

at the stars Admiring from afar My girl, my girl, my girl You will be my girl My girl, my girl, my girl You will be my world My world, my world, my world You will be my girl Smoking cigarettes on the roof You look so pretty and I love this view Don't bother looking down We're not going that way At least I know, I am here to stay We fell in love in October That's why, I love fall Looking at the stars Admiring from afarI'm running low on serotonin Chemical imbalance got me twisting things Stabilize with medicine There's no depth to these feelings Dig deep, can't hide From the corners of my mind I'm terrified of what's inside I get intrusive thoughts Like cutting my hands off Like jumping in front of a bus Like how do I make this stop When it feels like my therapist hates me Please don't let me go crazy Put me in a field with daisies Might not work, but I'll take a maybe Oh, been breaking daily But only me can save me So I'm capitulating, crying likе a fucking baby I don't wanna miss it, ba-da I don't wanna be sick, ah-da I don't, la-ba-deh-deh-ba-dеh Da-da-da-brah-la-da-daIt was a bad idea calling you up Was such a bad idea 'cause now I'm even more lost It was a bad idea to think you were the one Was such a bad idea 'cause now everything's wrong You put your hands under my shirt Undid my bra and said these words"Darling, you're so pretty, it hurts"You pushed me up against my wall Threw my clothes down on the floor"Darling, are you ready for more "It was a bad idea calling you up Was such a bad idea, I'm totally fucked It was a bad idea to think I could stop Was such a bad idea, I can't get enough It was a bad idea meeting you so late Was such a bad idea 'cause I can't think straight It was a bad idea to bring you back home Was such a bad idea, I need to be aloneDe-de-de-depression Teenage suicidal Why girls Emotional Social anxiety Pretty face with pretty bad dreams No one knows I cry in my sleep Waking up feeling like shit It's a normal thing to feel like this I don't care I'm feeling down I wanna stay home Never go outside Summer depression comes every year I just want to disappear Summer depression There's so much time to question my life Summer depression It's my Summer depressionI remember you couldn't stop crying You found me when I thought I was dying Believe me when I say I tried so hard to change All the crazy shit I made you do The long nights you held me through Believe me when I say I could never be saved Be saved Yeah, I tried To get it off my mind To leave it all behind Don't wanna make it worse I'm gonna make it work Yeah, I tried To get it off my mind To leave it all bеhind Don't wanna make it worse I'm gonna make it work I rеmember you stayed up all night To make sure I was alright Believe me when I say I would have done the same I hate the way my brain is wired Can't trust my mind, it's such a liar Believe me when I say I can't carry the weight The weightWhen I see you with her It only gets worse And, oh, how it hurts I can't say'Cause I'm all out of words Lost on this Earth Just floating around Someone help me down It's been so hard Ever since you broke my heart But I'll never tell Honey, I'm not doing so well It's not your fault I could've done more Like being upfront Honest about what I want But it's not like me To just say what I feel Though I feel it, it's real Oh-ohI know I don't want to Be the one that you run to When you got nowhere else to go When you need some love I know I'm the last one You try to call but I always give in To give you it all Oh-oh I can't be your midnight love Oh-oh-oh When your silver is my gold Oh-oh-oh In this light, I swear I'm blind Oh-oh-oh In this light, I swear you're mine I hope that the right time one day arrives So I'll be willing to let this die Able to look you right in the eyes Say I'm not your consolation prizeOne, two, three, four Empty bottles everywhere People sleeping on the stairs Got something stuck in my hair No idea how it got there This is the morning after The house is such a disaster But there's someone outside That caught my eye There's a dead girl in the pool There's a dead girl in the pool There's a dead girl in the pool I don't know what to do I'm the dead girl in the pool I'm the dead girl in the pool I'm the dead girl in the pool I can't stop staring at my face My summer tan has begun to fade Is this real or is this fake A creepy dream I can't escape
