Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you And by now, you shoulda somehow realised what you gotta do I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now And backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now And all the roads we have to walk are winding And all the lights that lead us there are blinding There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how Because maybe You're gonna be the one that saves me And after all You're my wonderwall Today was gonna be the day, but they'll never throw it back to you And by now, you shoulda somehow realised what you're not to do I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you nowSlip inside the eye of your mind Don't you know you might find A better place to play You said that you'd never been But all the things that you've seen Slowly fade away So I start a revolution from my bed'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head Step outside, summertime's in bloom Stand up beside the fireplace, take that look from off your face You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out And so, Sally can wait She knows it's too late as we're walkin' on by Her soul slides away But "Don't look back in anger," I heard you say Take me to the place where you go Where nobody knows if it's night or day Please don't put your life in the hands Of a rock 'n' roll band Who'll throw it all awayHow many special people change How many lives are living strange Where were you while we were gettin' high Slowly walking down the hall Faster than a cannonball Where were you while we were gettin' high Someday you will find me caught beneath the landslide In a champagne supernova in the sky Someday you will find me caught beneath the landslide In a champagne supernova, a champagne supernova in the sky Wake up the dawn and ask her why A dreamer dreams she never dies Wipe that tear away now from your eye Slowly walking down the hall Faster than a cannonball Where were you while we were gettin' high Oh yeah Maybe I don't really wanna know How your garden grows'Cause I just wanna fly Lately, did you ever feel the pain In the morning rain As it soaks you to the bone Maybe I just wanna fly Wanna live, I don't wanna die Maybe I just wanna breathe Maybe I just don't believe Maybe you're the same as me We see things they'll never see You and I are gonna live forever I said maybe I don't really wanna know How your garden grows'Cause I just wanna fly Lately, did you ever feel the pain In the morning rain As it soaks you to the bone I need to be myself I can't be no-one else I'm feeling supersonic, give me gin and tonic You can have it all, but how much do you want it You make me laugh Give me your autograph Can I ride with you in your B MW You can sail with me in my yellow submarine You need to find out'Cause no-one's gonna tell you what I'm on about You need to find a way for what you want to say But before tomorrow'Cause my friend said he'd take you home He sits in a corner all alone He lives under a waterfall Nobody can see him Nobody can ever hear him call Nobody can ever hear him call You need to be yourself You can't be no-one else I know a girl called Elsa, she's into Alka-Seltzer She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train And she makes me laugh I got her autograph She done it with a doctor on a helicopter She's sniffing in a tissue selling the Big IssueMade a meal and threw it up on Sunday I've got a lot of things to learn Said I would and I'll be leaving one day Before my heart starts to burn So what's the matter with you Sing me something new Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know They only seem to come and go away Times are hard when things have got no meaning I've found a key upon the floor Maybe you and I will not believe in The things we find behind the door So what's the matter with you Sing me something new Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know They only seem to come and go away Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be Stand by me, nobody knows Yeah, nobody knows, the way it's gonna beHold up Hold on Don't be scared You'll never change what's been and gone May your smile Shine on Don't be scared Your destiny may keep you warm'Cause all of the stars Are fading away Just try not to worry You'll see them someday Take what you need And be on your way And stop crying your heart out Get up Come on Why're you scared  You'll never change What's been and goneAll your dreams are made When you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade Today's the day that all the world will see Another sunny afternoon Walking to the sound of my favourite tune Tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know too soon Need a little time to wake up Need a little time to wake up, wake up Need a little time to wake up Need a little time to rest your mind You know you should so I guess you might as well What's the story, morning glory Well You need a little time to wake up, wake up Well What's the story, morning glory Well Need a little time to wake up, wake upSlide away and give it all you've got My today fell in from the top I dream of you and all the things you say I wonder where you are now Hold me down all the world's asleep Need you now you've knocked me off my feet I dream of you and we talk of growing old But you said, "Please don't!"Slide in baby, together we'll fly I've tried praying but I don't know what you're saying to me Now that you're mine We'll find a way of chasing the Sun Let me be the one that shines with you In the morning we don't know what to do Two of a kind We'll find a way to do what we've done Let me be the one who shines with you And we can slide away Slide away Slide away AwayToday is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you And by now, you shoulda somehow realised what you gotta do I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now And backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now And all the roads we have to walk are winding And all the lights that lead us there are blinding There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how Because maybe You're gonna be the one that saves me And after all You're my wonderwall Today was gonna be the day, but they'll never throw it back to you And by now, you shoulda somehow realised what you're not to do I don't believe that anybody feels
