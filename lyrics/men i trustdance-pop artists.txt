Show me how you care Tell me how you were loved before Show me how you smile Tell me why your hands are cold Show me how I’m turning around, I’m having visions of you But then I understand The friend I’m dreaming of is far away But I’m here, I’m here Show me how you’re proud Tell me how you reach the moon My thoughts err away tonight My heart fell to love again Show me how I’m turning around, I’m having visions of you But then I understand The friend I’m dreaming of is far away And doesn’t feel my love But I do, I doThere’s a voice I always trust Its friendly helping hand tells me leave, I must Cause I can’t stay forever, Cause I can't stay forever, By my window Cause I can’t stay forever Cause I can’t stay forever Rather chase a gentle breeze Set my thoughts by taller trees Cause I can’t stay forever, Cause I can't stay forever, By my window Cause I can’t stay forever Cause I can’t stay foreverI hope to be around The day we grasp in truth The nature of mind Befriending time, in truth In a midway I stand where many stood Only to come home again Walking through these streets I know too well But my thoughts stray away I dream of my future Remote from time bounds Becoming myself without any end I dream of my future Remote from time bounds Becoming myself in truth I wonder at this light Enclosed in our soul, in truth And bid our clay remain Soft as it is, in truthI’m happy as I am Cause I’m leaving Days will be the same In a different way Going to a place Where I used to stay Writing something new In this home I know We’ll be all right Stay here some time This country dog Won’t die in the city We’ll be all right Stay here some time This country dog won’t die in the city We’ll be all right Stay here some time This country dog Won’t die in the city We’ll be all right Stay here some time This country dog won’t die in the cityMy friend, you know you had your time a while But I'm willing to give you mine Few things we both have keep us alive My life and our true love is all we need All we need It's all we need It's all we need I don't want to feel a world against our love I don't want to grow old alone and broken heart We need It's all we need It's all we need It's all we need All we need All we need All we needSay, can you hear Is there a meaning to your grief Where there is pain you see grace As if sacrifice was a meaningful end in itself Your trial and error is error and error Staying at the end of a hallway Dozens of doors you never tried to open Narrow vision, you’re the scapegoat Try to fix things that have never been broken You’re self-absorbed Raving about your cryptic ways Aren’t willing to change Old grudges Hoping for your turn All the basement stories you heard Waiting for the world To bend around you Staying at the end of a hallway Dozens of doors you never tried to open Narrow vision, you’re the scapegoat Try to fix things that have never been brokenBae, you’re leaving again It’s rainy outside, you know Don’t wanna get cold Bae, you’re leaving again It’s rainy outside, you know Don’t wanna get cold“Bye, I’m running late”Didn’t say where she went God knows Bae, you’re running away Lost in the eye of men You’re roaming your way And he waits While she is so close to home Warmed up so that she stays His bae He told her "Bae, the porch is unlocked Even if no one else Comes by the front Now, I sense why the men Who live in these empty lands Don’t use them"Let’s lay down our masks And be true So that our eyes Be bound in affection Aware of our lust And our shared trust We can know each other And hear nature’s words My dear friend But let’s not talk this through Cause long words widen gaps between lovers We ought to be lone, my home’s your own Until we have each other we’re strangers I know there’s a reason We use such curves Riddles in smiles Rather than small talk I know we both want Things to be done In a truthful manner There lies our rest My dear friendYou wrap my feet in coloured blankets So I stay here all night You keep the one with many moons and stars It’s always for my shoulders So I stay here till waking hours Tell me how do you make everything feel a little easier So I stay here till waking hours Who could ever be this good to me I just can’t help but wonder You put a shirt on the ceiling light So the room won’t be too bright You give me time to be what I can be You’re never ahead, never behind me So I stay here till waking hours Tell me how do you make everything feel a little easier So I stay here till waking hours Who could ever be this good to me I just can’t help but wonderNight loots us of our time Hints of defeat through me Yielding to one final pun And shared flashing glaze But our will stays cloaked As we take a step back Our hearts talking low A fading Morse code But our will stays cloaked As we take a step back Our hearts talking low A fading Morse code"Quick!", says a darting bird Fierce is nature’s way Trophies bared up high Strong men do have firm grips And though I seize the high-prized advise Distracted by labor and wraiths I just can’t set my mind with it Keeping me away from heap
