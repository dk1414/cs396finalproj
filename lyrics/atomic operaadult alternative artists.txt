We try and explain All the bad things we survive Jesus This is Winter Land Jesus This is Winter Land I think it's strange How faith is a blind thing And there's no one we trust I think it's strange When it's always cold But it's never Christmas Strange...We doubt what we know Try and believe in ourselves Jesus This is Winter Land Jesus This is Winter LandI stopped and asked a strange old man Who was looking to the East If perchance he knew the time of day Looked at me so suddenly And with such a fiercesome gaze That I could see the wisdom in his eyes"Having eyes to see," said he"can you not read the signs That are written in the sky and on your soul For now the sky is burning red And there's just one thing left unsaid:Apocalypse isn't future tense Apocalypse is now Apocalypse in the present tense Apocalypse is now Apocalypse is now Apocalypse is now."All I ever wanted Was something huge Unmeasureable Not this Crumb of crusty bread Starched, whited linen Altar Grave Ungraving Not the here Most equal of shoulders pewed Pressed together and crowded Rising in unison In a perfect world We'll find the questions In a world without end Arched beams stretched over us Like ribs Sheltering Caging This common sense of surface Refracted light of windows paned This procession of vows Hovering in the rebreathed air This numbering of days For these two thousand years Eclipse This amen Not This This cupIt didn't have to be obscene To stop my heart with fantasy It's beautiful, but All I want is you It didn't have to be so complete You could have left Some room for Mystery When I turn out the light All I see is you I can hardly wait In the place where I've been waiting From the start Will I find a place to Stop my heart You didn't have to be so mean You could have held me as I Searched for meaning When I reach for the sky All I see is you You didn't have to be so cold When I look in the mirror I feel so old It's all meaningless But I believe in youThere's more silence than words Space and emptiness It's at the base of all of us It's the answer to our questions It will remind you of nothing Like life Love and death But silence was before all It fills their every breath Why is there so much pain Why is there so much violence The word of God is silence I need to hear I long to Please stop this silence Can not be Traced to anything Can't be replaced by anything Is not exchanged with anything Is the base of everything came and right away We're lost we're all alone and lost It's easy to say—so I've noticed It's better to say that you don't believe November came and right away We're lost we're all alone and lost It's easy to say—so I've noticed It's better to say that you don't believe A few half lies, if you survive The winter came with a bitter rain and washed away the reason I Turn away from me again I Turn away from Heaven The seasons change—and so they say It all remains the same anyway It's easy to feel like it's no good It's better to fall than to stand in The Way When one half truth is our whole lives The morning came with a darkening shame And blinded me with reasonI do hate evil And I do hate sin I do hate divorce And I hate this state we're living in I do hate rebellion And I do hate greed I do hate most religious men And I hate this hating hateful killing I Am the God of Hate And My hate is a Holy Flame I Am the God of Hate And my hate is a perfect thing I do hate Esau And I do hate death I do hate violence And I hate your whining, wasted breath I do hate the darkness And I do hate pain And I do hate the burning stench I hate My Love when used in vain I Am the God of Hate And My hate is a Holy Flame I Am the God of Hate And my hate is a perfect thing
