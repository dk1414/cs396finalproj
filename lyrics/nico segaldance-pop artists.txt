How was your day Yeah  I love youWell, like-like-like I stammer You used to be my wife-wife-wife But somewhere in the middle I got caught up in rehearsals In between the sheets, a riddle But I kid you not these days Because all I know is Kids These Days And it covers nights where you wish I could pull covers over you And I wish "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" would really come true So I could be with a girl like you, and you, and you And still make love to music Because muses call me to her cradling neck And arms like a crib And we make love just like a baby Passion and pain don't compare to you fashion and flame You are my fire, my water, even when you complain Or bite your lips and breath heavy Love sits in your chest, heaving, heavy, heaven You are the open gates of beauty and serenity And spoken, floating on ecstasy The places where we dwell For all's well that ends well Though both our loves might swell And burst It'll always be worth every moment, starting with the first My slice of pie The apple of my one-eyed caterpillar We shake pillars when we dance Hands grasping, folding our every glance Holding on strong to every second All we need is the art we make We are artisans, working at a craft We are soldiers, fighting for our dreams We are honorable, worthy of heavy metals Hanging around our cradling necks Cradling our hearts, arms like cribs We'll rock each other to sleep every night Being the rock star that you are Of all the galaxies, you are The one we focus Shows our dopeness Shows our closeness Come closerBaby it's alright I don't need your love no more I wish you knew What you meant to me The things you do They got me goin' crazy I know you're not mine And trust me that's just fine I'm not a bucket on a line to pull But baby it's alright I know that I'm better than before I'm a brand new And you don't need to understand It's all because of you I'm dragging my feet through the sand But I know you're not mine And trust me that's just fine You
