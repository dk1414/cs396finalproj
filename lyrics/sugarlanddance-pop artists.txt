What a shame Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah Big mistake, broke the sweetest promise That you never should have made I'm here on the kitchen floor You call, but I won't hear it You said "No one else"How could you do this, babe You really blew this, babe We ain't gettin' through this one, babe This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe This is the last time, this is the last time This is the last time, I'll ever call you "babe"What a waste Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe I break down every time you call We're a wreck, you're the wreckin' ball We said, "No one else"I've been sittin' here starin' at the clock on the wall And I've been layin' here prayin', prayin' she won't call It's just another call from home And you'll get it and be gone and I'll be cryin'And I'll be beggin' you, baby, beg you not to leave But I'll be left here waitin' with my heart on my sleeve Oh, for the next time we'll be here Seems like a million years and I think I'm dyin'What do I have to do to make you see She can't love you like me Why don't you stay I'm down on my knees I'm so tired of bein' lonely Don't I give you what you need When she calls you to go There is one thing you should know We don't have to live this way Baby, why don't you stay Where do we start How 'bout right here where we are You've been carryin' this weight around Walk in the door and lay it down Life goes fast It's been a while, I have to ask Where have you been  How did that feel Where are we now  'Cause that's what's real, yeah All the space and the time between us Man, you should have seen us This ain't no mystery Our future is our history I feel alive, and can we try To leave it better than how it came Don't be afraid to change Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same And here we are , we've come so far Let's leave it better than how it came Don't be afraid to change Our love is still the same, still the same, still the sameShe'll take you in, feed your friends Her open arms are welcoming She'll rub your back all night when you're crying She'll listen to you tell your story Hold your fear and all your worries Help you find the truth when they're all lying Even when it's hopeless, she keeps trying She's your mother, you love her There won't be another place like her again that you call home She stands here to help you, there's nothing she won't do As long as she's alive, you're not alone, you've got each other That's your mother She fixes all the broken things When you're in love, she's got a ring To give to you, she hopes you'll give away She don't care who you give it to Where they're from, if they pray like you As long as they are good to you, that's enough First thing she taught you was love is love She's your mother, you love her There won't be another place like her again that you call home She stands here to help you, there's nothing she won't do As long as she's alive, you're not alone, you've got each other That's your motherMmm, better Mmm, better Absolutely no one that knows me better No one that can make me feel so good How did we stay so long together When everybody, everybody said we never would And just when I, I start to think they're right The love has died There you go making my heart beat again Heart beat again, heart beat again There you go making me feel like a kid Won't you do it and do it one time There you go pulling me right back in Right back in, right back in And I know, oh I'm never letting this go I'm stuck on you Whoa-oh, whoa-oh Stuck like glue You and me, baby, we're stuck like glue Whoa-oh, whoa-oh Stuck like glue You and me, baby, we're stuck like glueThey say this town The stars stay up all night Well, I don't know, can't see 'em For the glow of the neon lights And it's a long way from here To the place where the home fires burn Well, it's two-thousand miles and one left turn Dear Mom and Dad, please send money I'm so broke that it ain't funny Well, I don't need much, just enough to get me through Please don't worry 'cause I'm alright See, I'm playin' here at the bar tonight Well, this time I'm gonna make our dreams come true Well, I love you more than anything in the world Love, your baby girl Black top, blue sky Big town full of little white lies Well, everybody's your friend, you can never be sure They'll promise fancy cars and diamond rings And all sorts of shiny things But, girl, you'll remember what your knees are forPeople walkin' around like the world's about to end And if you’re asking me, my mind would agree These days we all feel small, my friend It’s getting harder and harder to hold our heads up high Baby, let’s circle the wagons Show all the dragons they don’t own the sky We know how to fly Gravity can’t hold us down We're moving at the speed of sound Past the point from here on out There’s no going back'Cause we were born for better days We’ll find a way, yeah We’re gonna be bigger Don't give up, you’re more than enough Believe me love, yeah You’re gonna be bigger Lookin' at everybody else And you hate yourself And it hurts your heart Yeah, it’s easy to let it Make you forget it You are perfect the way you areYesterday hell rained down Another kid, another school, in another town Think about how to tell my son Think about how that one got a gun There are mysteries down where the blood meets the bone The loneliness there, wouldn't leave him alone But what if we try to reach him with words What if we looked in his eyes and asked "where does it hurt "Would he find all he was worth Monday was hoping But Tuesday's broken On the bed, feet up on the wall Her eyes are red, and wet, and she wants to end it all Easy to be mean on the screen, cowards call you names She reads the lies and multiplies the hurt and shame Man, it's a numbers game There are mysteries down where the blood meets the bone The loneliness there, it won't leave her alone But what if we try to reach her with words What if we looked in her eyes and asked "where does it hurt "Would she find all she was worth Monday was hoping But Tuesday's brokenGot my hands in my pocket Got a heart like a rocket Man, a train couldn't stop it today I got a smile like the sunshine Eyes close, keeping time My feet know the beat and the way Can't hold this down We own this town Done walkin' 'round From now on...I'm on a roll, babe Watch me go, babe I'm solid gold, babe Of good things getting better Life is short, but so sweet So cut the cake and let's eat Right next to me is where you wanna be I just can't stop I'm on a roll I'm on a rollMissed my alarm clock ringing Woke up, telephone screaming Boss man singing his same old song Rolled in late about an hour No cup of coffee, no shower Walk of shame with two different shoes on Now it's poor me, why me, oh me, boring The same old worn out blah blah story There's no good explanation for it at all Ain't no rhyme or reason No complicated meaning Ain't no need to over think it Let go laughing Life don't go quite like you planned it We try so hard to understand it The irrefutable, indisputable fact is Pshh it happens My trusty-rusty had a flat I borrowed my neighbors cadillac"I'll be right back," going down to wally world That yellowed light turned red too quickly Knew that truck the moment it hit me Out stepped my ex and his new girl"Sorry 'bout your neck baby"But it's poor me, why me, oh me, boring The same old worn out blah blah story There's no good explanation for it at all
