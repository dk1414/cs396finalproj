I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear I keep forgettin'Everytime you're near Everytime I see you smile Hear your "hello"Saying you can only stay a while Hey, I know that it's hard for you To say the things that we both know are true But tell me how come I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear I keep forgettin'Everytime I hear How you never want to live a lie How it's gone too far And you don't have to tell me whyHe came from somewhere back in her long ago The sentimental fool don't see Tryin' hard to recreate What had yet to be created once in her life She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale Never coming near what he wanted to say Only to realize it never really was She had a place in his life He never made her think twice As he rises to her apology Anybody else would surely know He's watching her go But what a fool believes, he sees No wise man has the power to reason away What seems to be Is always better than nothing Than nothing at all Keeps sending him somewhere back in her long ago Where he can still believe there's a place in her life Someday, somewhere She will returnNo more running down the wrong road Dancing to a different drum Can`t you see what`s going on Deep inside your heart Always searching for the real thing Living like it's far away Just leave all the madness in yesterday You're holding the key when you believe it Shine, sweet freedom Shine your light on me You are the magic You're right where I want to be Oh, sweet freedom Carry me along We'll keep the spirit alive On and on We'll be dancing in the moonlight Smiling with the rising sun Living like we've never known Going all the way Reaching out to meet the changes Touching every shining star The light of tomorrow It's right where we are There's no turning back from what I'm feelingIt was so right, it was so wrong Almost at the same time The pain and ache a heart can take No one really knows When the memories cling and keep you there'Til you no longer care And you can let go now It's wrong for me to cling to you Somehow I just needed time From what was to be, it's not like me To hold somebody down But I was tossed high by love I almost never came down Only to land here Where love's no longer found Where I'm no longer bound And I can let go nowMaybe it's true what they say about Maybe we can't make the ends meet Maybe we'll all have to do without Maybe this world's just incomplete Well, we all look for truth in this life Searching with hope inside If it's so hard living in a desperate world We all do the best that we can Some people see a change Some will remain the same Others will live their lives under the gun Some see the road as clear Some say the end is here They say it's a hopeless fight But I say I gotta try now Oh, I've got to try, baby Maybe it's too much to think about Maybe there ain't nothin' left to say But if our time is really runnin' out Then this ain't no time to run awayI have come from so far away Down the road of my own mistakes In the hope you could hear me pray Oh Lord, keep me in your reach How I've longed through these wasted years To outrun all the pain and fear Turned to stone from my uncried tears And now it's Your grace I seek Love won't compromise It's a gift, it's a sacrifice My soul renewed, and my heart released In You I'll find my peace Oh wondrous child of whom the angels sing Know my joy, feels my suffering Shining star make this love you bring So bright that I may believe That my way will not be lost From now on, 'til that river's crossed My soul renewed, and my spirit free In You I'll find my peaceWhen desire moves from head to heart You may lose the luxury To have your fun and play it smart Take your pleasure and still be free Oh, the loneliness at the end of every dream Don't you know that there's more to this Let go of all your reasons And find something to believe You gotta find it in your heart You'll only find it in your heart now baby Love's the truth that sets us free You'll only find it in your heart Now you found someone who cares You got your life all figured out But the truth is you're not really there'Till you give in beyond a doubt Let go of your fantasies And start looking for something real Your best thinking is what got you here Illusion will be shattered by the truth that love reveals You better find it in your heart You'll only find it in your heart now baby Love's the key that sets us free Oh girl, get out of your headWhy'd you tell me this While you look for my reaction What do you need to know Don't you know I'll always be the one You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers I've got lovin' eyes of my own You belong to me In this life Anyone could tell Any fool can see who you need I know you all too well You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers I've got lovin' eyes, and I can tell Tell him Tell him you were foolin'Oh, girl, you belong to me Tell him he's a stranger You belong to me, girlUsed to think I wore myself out on you Trying to measure up Now I know I just grew tired of forgiving you, baby For not loving me enough Now I realize it's in my nature To want to hold on to what I thought it was Just as long as I'm still just strong enough I never had the sense to surrender Or the grace to walk away Always hoping against all hope You'd have a change of heart someday Oh, but ain't it only human nature To want to love and be loved Just as long as I'm still just strong enough Though you're my greatest weakness I keep carrying that weight I keep looking for completeness, baby I tell myself it's not too late Not as long as I'm still just strong enough With a heart that still remembers And a love that won't give up No, not as long as I'm still just strong enoughI know that there is more to life Than this little piece that I've broken off and keep suspended Safe behind these four walls But have I just blocked out the sky That fills that old river with pure water Of love stronger than pride Honest emotion So hard to come by Once it hurts you enough to last a lifetime With honest emotion Would honest emotion even know me if I walk through this door I'm a skater on the lake of love Always gliding on the surface of deeper feelings But never falling through On my blades of flash and steel Between the sky and deep blue clear crystal Waters of pure love Honest emotion So hard to come by Once it hurts you enough to last a lifetime With honest emotion Would honest emotion even know me if I walk through this door
