I had a dream so big and loud I jumped so high, I touched the clouds Wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh I stretched my hands out to the sky We danced with monsters through the night Wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh I'm never gonna look back, whoa I'm never gonna give it up, no Please don't wake me now2, 3, 4â€¦This is gonna be the best day of my life My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife This is gonna be the best day of my life My li-i-i-i-i-i-ifeI'm born to run down rocky cliffs Give me grace, bury my sins Shattered glass and black holes Can't hold me back from where I need to go Yellow hills and valleys deep I watch them move under my feet Stranger things have come and gone To see the world and take the throne Don't hold back Oh, I won't hold back I'm gonna live my life like I'm gonna die young Like it's never enough, like I'm born to run I'm gonna spend my time like tomorrow won't come Do whatever I want like I'm born to run I wanna see Paris, I wanna see Tokyo I wanna be careless even if I break my bones I'm gonna live my life like I'm gonna die young Like it's never enough, like I'm born to run A winding road where strangers meet To feel the love of a warm drink My body moves, it's speaking loud Don't have to say what I'm thinking nowIt comes and goes in waves It always runs back but it's never quite the same Well I think there's something wrong with me Got nothing to believe, can't you see it on my face I was going for the title, got hit by your tidal wave, uh Can't stay in the shallows, please tell me I won't wash away When it pulls me under, will you make me stronger Will you be my breath through the deep, deep water Take me farther, give me one day longer Will you be my breath through the deep, deep water Ain't even scratched the surface Thinking I deserve the dream but I don't deserve the hurting I want the flame without the burning But I can't find my purpose when I don't know what my worth isSome say if you don't go Then you won't know how to let go When you gotta let it swerve Some say if you don't try Then you won't know how to get by No one said it wouldn't hurt Oh, no If I knew then what I should've known now Up and down, jump off the deep end Wreck this house, I should've left with you, with you No way out, I met your best friend, she went down I should've made my move, with you I shoulda, I woulda, I coulda, but I didn't Hit it Some say if you break down, and you touch ground Then you dropped out still you got a lot to learn But I say take it back up Throw it on now, make it stack up'Cause tonight we're gonna burn it downI drive a beat-up car, a caravan, the color blue Reminds me of your eyes and all the places we've been to We're tethered to the leather, searching for a better view It's interstellar when it's me and you We're taking off We're taking off This is what I live for Baby, you're my open road You can take me anywhere the wind blows Right into the great unknown We can throw our hands up out the window This is what we live for We look up at the stars, a perfect night to dream with you Got 90's retro on the radio, our favorite tune I put the pedal to the metal just to laugh with you It's interstellar when it's just us two We're taking off We're taking offAll I need is a head full of hope And a love, and a home, and a car, and a loan And I wish I had a pocket full of gold All I need is a laugh And a drink, and a couch, and a shrink, and a moment to think And I wish I had a pocket full of gold So throw your sticks and throw your stones'Cause you ain't gonna break my bones, yeah If I'm a sinner Then I don't feel ashamed Life goes on, and if I'm wrong I guess I'll burn in flames Been up the river And I've been down the drain But life goes on, and if I'm wrong I guess I'll burn in flames All I need is a hand I could hold And a crowd at the show, and a rhyme, and a flow And I wish I had a pocket full of gold All I need is a job that I love And some friends at the pub, and a night full of fun While I'm searching for a pocket full of goldMy home don't feel the same Last year flew by; goodbye to the good vibes What we thought were the best times Nights out with the people I love Now I'm lost in the neighborhood That raised me, praised me, made me who I am But my father was twice the man And now that pain's resurfacing Brooklyn don't feel the same Maybe I'm the one who's changed or the one to blame Another drink down the drain Ten more before I get on that plane I swear I knew just what to say It's all there on the tip of my tongue But I don't feel good enough for anyone But I won't fold I know cause I-I-I-I got this feeling I ain't never giving up, I ain't never ever, I ain't never ever giving up my pride I ain't never letting go, I ain't never ever, I ain't never ever gonna sell my soul I-I-I-I got this feeling I-I-I got this feeling I ain't never giving up, I ain't never ever, I ain't never ever giving up my prideHow can we make amends When we said all we said I call and you don't pick up How can I say instead That I hope it's for the best I won't, and I won't give up I'm sorry mother I know I let you down I'm sorry for how I up and left this town How can we push aside All the bad and make it right Now you got me all choked up I'm sorry brother I know I let you down I'm sorry for how I up and left this town But please, just listen'Cause I don't ask for much I am my own man I make my own luck How can we both take sides When we know nothing's right Open up the door that's shut How can I have my pride And drink away my soul tonight Sorrows filling up my cupI'm just a believer, that things will get better Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go I'm just a believer, that things will get better Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go I'm a little bit sheltered I'm a little bit scared I'm a little bit nervous I'm going nowhere I'm a little bit jealous I'm a little bit slow I'm a little bit hurtful And I don't wanna let it go No, and I don't wanna let it go I'm a little bit angry, when everyone's around But I get a little lonely, when no one's out I feel my demons misleading me I'm just a believer, that things will get better Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go I'm just a believer, that things will get better Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it goNo I can't take it anymore I bang my head against the door I'm going out, I, I, love it, love it The doctor said I need to sleep But I go crazy counting sheep I'm going out, I, I, love it, love it Let's get wild and make a memory Hey ya, I wanna go out I wanna go out, I wanna-na Hey ya, I wanna go out Out of my mind Hey ya, I wanna check out Step off of my cloud Hey ya, I wanna go out Out of my mind Oh I'm a zombie, I'm a corpse Every day is so boring I'm going out, I, I, love it, love it I'm jumping out the window Smilin' down at the world below I, I, love it, love it
