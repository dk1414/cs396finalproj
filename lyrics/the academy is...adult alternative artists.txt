One song about a girl Can't breathe when I'm around her I wait here everyday in case She scratched the surface She'll never notice I'm not in love This is not my heart I'm not gonna waste these words about a girl Last night I knew what to say But you weren't there to hear it These lines so well rehearsed, tongue-tied And overloaded You never notice I'm not in love This is not my heart I'm not gonna waste these words about a girl I'm not in love This is not your song I'm not gonna waste these words about a girlClose the door and take the stairs Up or down, ups and downs Well, don't pretend you've never been there You kiss me like an over-dramatic actor Who's starving for work With one last shot to make it happen You've won the role, you've played your part You've been cordially invited But I'm not impressed, and I'm definitely not excited'Cause the film runs a shallow budget And the writer's subject script isn't any deeper So dive right in Hollywood hills and suburban thrills Hey you, who are you kidding I'm not like them, I won't buy in Hollywood hills and suburban thrills Hey you, who are you kidding Don't quit 'til 47 Then we'll turn it up, and we'll play a little faster Take back everything you ever said You never meant a word of it You never did Take back everything you said You never meant a word of it You never didMy eyes can't believe what they have seen In the corner of your room you've stockpiled millions of my memories Oh, doctor, doctor I must have gotten this sick somehow I'm going to ask you a series of questions And I want them answered on the spot Right now"Is it serious ""I'm afraid it is""Am I gonna die ""Well, son Death is gonna catch up to all one day But yours is coming quicker than ours, than ours"Some things I may have taken for granted again and again Well, here's what was said then Hold your head high, heavy heart So take a chance and make it big'Cause it's the last you'll ever get If we don't take it When will we make it I make plans to break plans And I've been planning something big Planning something big PlanningSo listen up I worked in daylight feeding fashion to housewives For just this once I'll take my chances on truck stops and state lines Go ahead and tell them again Well, I think that I know they won't remember Go out and tell them twice Yeah, twice is nice But three times is just right Hey, hey Now we're almost home I'm missing you to death But it's all for the best I know Hey, hey We're not far from home And I've got my pride And I'll let you sleep tonight So listen up My old friends have been dropping like houseflies The smoking gun still sits in my pocket and I know how to use itAttention, attention May I have all your eyes and ears to the front of the room If only, if only for one second This table has taken a turn for the worse Rock bottom and over the edge Well, it's not like it hurts that much anyway Upside down and inside out When I leave here I'm going alone Well, it's not like it Not like it hurts much anyway Attention, attention May I have all your eyes and ears to the front of the room If only, if only for one second Will you hear what I have to say Oh, did I mention when I see you it stings like hell Due to the fact that we could have something that'll never happen Will you hear what I have to This balance has weighed out our heart’s desire I’m trying to make it alone Well, it’s not like it hurts that much anyway Upside down and inside out When I leave here I’m going alone But I’m dying, I’m dying to touch And it’s not like it Not like it hurts much anywayYou were the only face I'd ever known I was the light from the lamp on the floor And only as bright as you wanted me to be But, I am no gentleman, I can be a prick And I do regret more than I admit You have been followed Back to the same place I sat with you drink for drink Take the pain out of love and then love won't exist Everything we had, everything we had Everything we had, everything we had Is no longer there It was the only place I'd ever known Turned off the light on my way out the door I will be watching wherever you go Through the eyes of a fly on the wall You have been followed Back to the same place I sat with you drink for drink Take the pain out of love and then love won't exist Everything we had, everything we had Everything we had, everything we had Is no longer there, longer there Well you saw for yourself, the way it played out For you, I am blinded For you, I am blinded, for youI’ve got that lefty curse Where everything I do is flipped And awkwardly reversed You’re seldom known and barely missed I always put myself In destructive situations I need oxygen To be exposed where no one goes, where no one’s been When it all comes crashing Now we’ve got a big, big Mess on our hands tonight Sing it Now we’ve got a big, big Mess on our hands tonight Somebody get my phone So I can throw it in a public Pool and watch it float And as it slowly sinking down Become a social ghost Inside a box, cut at the top To let some light shine in To remind me what I’ve done and where I’ve been When it all comes crashingMy life reads like the classifieds Pages of what's for sale What's on the auction block Attention, bidders It's Lot 45 He's got a decent voice He's got that crooked smile Hold on You haven't heard the best yet He writes good story lines He's got those honest eyes So take him home for just $9.95 He'll sing the songs you like He'll keep you warm at night, at night Back down, cash out That's the city for you Break down, back out And get what's coming to you When you said you were falling apart I thought you meant that you were falling apart I'm not the type to forget about Nights like this When every single move that I make Is documented and scored for style points The once ambitious one now holds the smoking gun And if I die in my sleep Are you still willing to be Everything you promised you would be We're crashing cars we used to share With summer girls with summer hair We're driving around, chasing the stars But the party's busted up before it ever starts I'll never let you go Don't ever forget Tell me you'll remember Forever young I'll never let you fall It's not over yet You and me forever Forever young We're forever young Stop making plans, start making sense Don't you believe any word they said Sparked up, sparked up like a book of matches Falling through the night and rising from the ashes I'll never let you go Don't ever forget Tell me you'll remember Forever young I'll never let you fall It's not over yet You and me forever Forever young We're forever youngSo there you are And here I stand As far as I remember You weren't half bad Your bedroom behavior was never more than checkmarks on bedposts The more I remember we never had Get me out of the rain You get me out of my clothes Hope I don't make a sound You hope that nobody knows Get me out of the rain Get me out of my clothes Hope I don't make a sound You hope that no one So suck your so-called pity down It's not so bad, is it So take your cold, cold heart and drown And don't forget to take deep breaths So suck your so-called pity down It's not so bad, is it So take your cold, cold heart and drown And don't forget to take deep breaths
