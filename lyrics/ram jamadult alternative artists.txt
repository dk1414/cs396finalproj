Carry on now, goin' strong Carry on now It's a magical wheel that you try to conceal To prove it for real that's she's back in the grand illusion But the words that come out are just frustrated doubt A definite cloud and a stop in the solutionI heard your best friend say he shouldn't have treated you that way He could've been a little bit kinder He didn't give you no gift, didn't send you no smoke You didn't even get a reminder It's too bad , it's too bad It's too bad on your birthday Too bad , too bad Too bad on your birthday You were my lover once, it lasted several months And I was in love, even blinder When you left me, I cried, my tears haven't dried So I'll leave you this little reminder Too bad , it's too bad It's too bad on your birthday Too bad , it's too bad It's too bad on your birthday Check it, baby Too bad, too bad Too bad on your birthday Too bad , too bad Too bad on your birthday I was feelin' low down, almost level to the ground You know I needed someone to come around I was so lonely, I was so lonely Just in time, my baby came to me Said, "What you get is what you see"And now she, she my one and only No one can do what you do to me, honey You're right on the money No one can do what you do to me, honey You're right on the money I ain't rich, I got no fancy car But I got your lovin' and my guitar That's all I need, a-that's all I need When you're doin' what you

in the place where my love was lost in Oh baby, what's it costin' me Looked for your face in the railway station Thought it was you, but now I'm mistaken Where do I look in this great big nation for you Stuck on the turnpike It's taken me days to hitchhike Ain't no love like me and you Stuck on the turnpike It's taken me days to hitchhike Ain't no love like me and you I was a clown in your circus parade You were the tamer, I was the tamed You were the one that started the flame Why can't the love that we had be the same Ridin' the southside ferry I'm holdin' my soul with a bottle of sherry Oh baby, don't you bury me Telephone calls that I made to Boston Have you returned to your home in Austin Oh baby, how it's costin' meI'm the midnight masher, gonna walk you home Force myself upon you 'cause I'm all alone Gonna find madness in a silver spoon Throw my sadness and a-shoot the moon I don't know just what is wrong with me I just want you to make love to me, yeah I'm the master of your love disaster'Cause I wanna find love, wanna find love Wanna find love Wanna find love, wanna find love Wanna find love I'm the reckless spender and it's plain to see All my money can't buy love for me You know that I'm the master of your love disaster'Cause I wanna find love, wanna find love Wanna find love Wanna find love, wanna find love Wanna find love Wanna find love, wanna find love Wanna find love Wanna find love, wanna find love Wanna find love
