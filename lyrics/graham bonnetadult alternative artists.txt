Verse:See the man on the busy street He's almost incomplete He takes his pleasure in strange ways And the lady in the liberty She's just like you and me You wouldn't know her at all She takes a train up to the great big city She knocks a door and steps right in He's just a fool that some would like to pity They work to out in the house of sin Chorus:Night games, they pay for their Night games, they work to numbers They' don't use names it says in the rules It's strictly for cools to play their night games They pay for their night games Always play one last frame Games of the night Verse:Every room is a different scene Every one has a dirrefent dream They make it anyway they choose You can get anything you need Anyone if the price's agreed And nothing left for you to lose It's entertainment for the lost and lonely And cabaret for those who dare The last attainment of the one and only It's got to be to get you thereOh Come to me baby, I got something to say I've been changing your direction every step of the way I bring you motion and I bring desire And I bring the potion to set you on fire I know you need me, there can be no doubt You've got me held inside your love and I can't get out We must surrender to the powers that be The angel in you and the devil in me Warm ride, war-are-arm ride Baby that's the way you are Warm ride, war-are-arm ride We can reach the highest star Now I warn you woman, we are two of a kind And we both know what's comin', we got one thing in mind I give the pleasure, satisfaction you learn And I got the strength to make you burn, burn, burn Warm ride, war-are-arm ride Baby that's the way you are Warm ride, war-are-arm ride We can reach the highest starVerse:I feel so lonely, even though you're around You're putting me down baby, and it's all over town They're calling me bad, they say I ain't got no heart But that ain't true babe, and it's tearing me apart, tearing me apart Chorus:I ain't a fighter, but I'm a man I'm a lover, just doing the best I can I ain't a fighter, but I'm a man I'm a lover, just doing the best I can Solo:Verse:And I ain't trying, to do no body no wrong So if you want some loving, please come along Give me your courage, and give me your pride I'll give you loving, that can't be denied, can't be denied Chorus & repeat---A stranger in town, strutting around, he's so impeccably dressed Suited up to succeed Asked if I knew where he'd find work teaching kids His twisted smile gave me the creeps as he said that Was it the work or a child that he needs Say have you met “Uncle John ”That's what the kids lovingly called him Save them before they are gone Down the dark path to the predator's sanctuary I'd seen his face, somewhere, some place, was it the nеws of the world Or one of those Sunday rags This can't bе him, let me look, wait a minute, it is!He taught in schools, subjects diverse Hiding so well his perverted curse Say have you met “Uncle John ”That's what the kids lovingly called him Save them before they are gone Down the dark path to the predator's sanctuary His persona divine, disturbingly sweet He's perfected his craft Hiding lust and deceit And the innocents suffer As he has his wayWho is the man that stares at me Shaving my face electric Could it be the mirror glass Somehow became defective He's an aging imitation of the man I am He can't be me, he's unwelcome So get out, be gone!Who are you, pretender now I can see The stranger reflecting, that man is me!We made a promise to ourselves We would be young forevеr Growing old's for someone elsе Age is just a number As we watch the number climbing We all want to hear Someone say “my God, you look good”After all these years Who are you, pretender now I can see The stranger reflecting, that man is me!Who are you, pretender now I can see The stranger reflecting, that man is me!The long lost summer left us Worn autumn skin That tanned physique, a badge of honorDriving the Russian countryside The sky was so clear and sunny Herds of horses running free Some far off dogs were barking There goes a fox on the hunt Fields were planted, flowers grow After we burned a few more miles The sky and earth were silent No birds were flying, no dogs were barking No signs of life around us It was like all nature died There's nothing growing Where did we go to on that aftеrnoon Was it a day out in nowhere Was this the dark sidе of the moon Can't be, the sun is shining Are we the last people here on earth Ahead we saw city lights burning As we drove into town The people were alive and well Where did we go to on that afternoon Was it a day out in nowhere Rarely have we seen a person fail that has thoroughly followed our path  Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program  Usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves Bill W, I'm confused as I scan these rules A game you play step by step Twelve steps before me, to master them all And reach a goal I've never met I thought I could do this easy All on my own No one can tell me how No one told me it's not easy, now that I know Oh, how it hit me hard Will I connect, in this sobering quest Some players took this road and fell Losing the way, when this game was too hard Misunderstanding, so to fail I thought I could do this easy All on my own No one can tell me how No one told me it's not easy, now that I know Oh, how it hit me hardHis girlfriend showed him a latex rubber suit She told him let's try something new Shining black, like her body is soaking wet Head to toe, a statue in jet Stunned and frozen like headlights on a deer Her looks excite him, disturbingly clear With strut stiletto, she straddled her prey He was taken, won't push her away Times have changed, where is that so sweet girl He showed the way, now she is the one who's leading Come into brave new world, see what you have missed Break the bond that ties you down, put all your fears to rest Life for him was just black and white Straight ahead, no turn left or right His comfort zone is permanently changed You bet your life he won't go back again Times have changed, where is that so sweet girl He showed the way, now she is the one who's leadingWhat to say on this peaceful day When the sky begins screaming The throat of a lion The ground will shake from the sound it made What are we hearing The sky begins screaming Has there awakened something from its sleep Or is the whole planet crying How can we hide from a thing we can't see The sound that we hear brang a warning The sky is alive I hear it breathing The sky is alive What are we hearing Here wе stand in a crowd alone There's safеty in numbers But what are we facing Beyond the blue and beyond the moon Is something watching, something is waiting The sound that we hear like a heavy machine Twisted in pain from its labor Are we in danger of something unseen Destined to haunt us foreverYou got to be crazy, you gotta have a real need Gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street Got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking And after a while, you can work on points for style Like the club tie and the firm handshake A certain look in the eye and an easy smile You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to So that whеn they turn their backs on you You'll get thе chance to put the knife in You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder You know, it's gonna get harder, harder, harder as you get older Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south Hide your head in the sand Just another sad old man All alone and dying of cancer And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around So have a good drown, as you go down all alone Dragged down by the stone
