You could have been all I wanted But you weren't honest, now get in the ground You choked off the surest of favors But if you really loved me, you would have endured my world Well if you're just as I presumed A whore in sheep's clothing, fucking up all I do And if so here we stop Then never again will you see this in your life Hang on to the glory at my right hand Here laid to rest is our love ever longed With truth on the shores of compassion You seem to take premise to all of these songs You stormed off to scar the armada Like Jesus played letter, I'll drill through your hands The stone for the curse you have blamed me With love and devotion, I'll die as you sleep But if you could just write me out To neverless wonder, happy will I become Be true that this is no option So with sin, I condemn you, demon pray, demon outIt begins with them, but ends with me, their son, Vaxis Hey  Hey  Hey  Hey!Hey  Hey  Hey  Hey!Hey  Hey  Hey  Hey!Hey  Hey  Hey  Hey!Here, emotions behold You've entered a Hell where the Devil is made of gold Please, don’t run your mouth The questions before have no place in this haunted house Reveal your selfish pleasure One more time 'round for good measure In the answer you hold Time would be better off if our souls had been sold Here where the light only dies to remember In the place where the blind truly can see Hear my voice, dearly departed, I beg on my knees It’s been my pleasure to serve your disease Welcome home Shed your skin and expose your bones Take my hand And follow us into the black So far that we can’t get backIs there a word or right to say Even in this old-fashioned way Go make your move, girl, I'm not coming home Would things have changed if I could've stayed Would you have loved me either way Dressed to the blues, day to day, with my collar up Decision sits, so make it quick A breath inhaled from an air so sick I cursed the day that I learned of the web you spun If it was up to me I would've figured you out Way before the year clocked out Oh, I hope you're waiting If it was up to me I would've never walked out So until the sun burns out Oh, I hope you're waiting Would we have lived as a child would care With this vial to drink, I dare Only to cry all alone with your taste on tongue Should we try this again, with hope  Or is it lost  Give up the ghost And should I die, all alone, as I knew I would A broad incision sits across the evening The victim to our fathers' lost war The restless children sit and mourn the graves Of those they've never seen before Will they be buried here, among the dead In the silent secret The pioneers In dealing with it, they'll march for dawn Of Will and worthy The truth be told, the child was born Man your own jackhammer!Man your battle stations We'll have you dead pretty soon And now Sincerely written From my brother's blood machine Man your battle stations We'll have you home pretty soon And now Awake through motion, with curious to curtain your first move Over arms length, they'll break protocol Jealous envy for the youngest one To be the hero is all I'll ask Can I be buried here, among the dead With room to honor me here in the end You'll be better off too soon You'll be better off when you get homeYour eyes tell the stories of a day you wish you could Recall the moments that once have Retract the footsteps that brought us to this favor I wouldn't ask this of you Good eye, sniper Here, I'll shoot, you run The words you scribbled on the walls With the loss of friends you didn't have I'll call you when the time is right Are you in or are you out For them all to know the end of us all Run quick, they're behind us, didn't think we'd ever make it This close to safety, in one piece Now you wanna kill me in the act of what could maybe Save us from sleep and what we are Good eye, sniper Now I shoot, you runWe were young and had it all figured out She was the quiet one and I had the mouth Until she fell to me We escaped through the alley in the back Judge told me, "Creature, don't you dare go back!"But I couldn't dodge the ringing in my head Her lonely, subtle voice, through the echoes as it said"Please don't leave me here, my love"Oh, pretty angel Swinging from your cable I fear, my dear, the end is near So run, run, run, run, run like a son of a gun Did anybody treat you better To obey and follow to the letter I fear, my dear, the end is here So run, run, run, run, run like a son of a gun There was something I forgot to tell her then Between the kiss and, "Knock 'em dead, kid""There will be no other like you" Now I can't keep the guilt from my heart These stuttering emotions keep me fixed to fall apart And I know I'm leaving all this sweat in our bed A broken heart bleeding with a gun to my headOver my dead body The stars will let you know It's over Now, if I had my way I would leave you here to waste your final days Buried beneath Oh, please rest assured This was not my fault and time is getting short So, I'll be here if you want me Oh, my darling, can you hear My words so pure they burn your lying ears And so the story goes When I leave Will you let me go When the words stop coming And the fear starts setting in slow Don't let me find you hiding under the covers It's your last chance, honey, better All hope is lost Down in the gutterI can feel it in the way your blood and heart beats Or is it in the way your body moves The words I drag out from your mouth speak In her vision, I have given company Believer, you'll leave her in leaving them all Like anything you do, as anyone you are Believer, you'll leave her in leaving them all Like anything you do, as anyone you are If written wrote me even chance and the choice to save you I wouldn't answer if it even had to ask In her figure, I've instilled a taste of my own To make it easier to take what life I'm owedHey, what became of my head The beats in my heart, the jokes that I said I guess all these false starts Of a puzzle you can't finish 'cause you're missing the best parts And don't you fear, I'm bringing you home Out of this pit where I left you alone In this horrible mess that I made But I guess that's what you get when you're not paying attention So baby, welcome back to the man you've been missing Baby, welcome back to confusing, perplexing We all go up in flames Going out in style And Heaven help us Hope that Hell will let us rest for just a little while, yeah We all go up in flames Going out in style Am I out of my head to think The world could start believing me when I am dead I was a mess of a man with washed up excuses I know, I know part of the confusion is me We both agree That I wasn't the man that you needed me to be But, oh, how I changed and oh, how I've grown But could she believe me when I've got nothing to show My everything, she needs to see The choice is hers to believe in meWe carried on, unnoticed Thinking that all dreams were ours for the taking And out of that, we found ourselves back at the start of it all So scarred and incomplete Only now, I've come to this moment in my life Fitting pieces to a puzzle with no regrets But if I had just one chance left I'd hold on to her close, with what little confidence I have And make no mistakes, as your life's surely about to change For the better half Now, on your marks, get set, clock starts to count'Cause boy, everything's about to go down So sleep tight, little Atlas'Cause when your daddy goes off, just you know That you're the weight of his anchor The love that is guiding him home The love that's guiding him home Oh, I've had my share of leaving this retreat But never did it once feel anything Like you, you see And if there's one good thing that comes from my away It's that you won't be anything like me Oh, and so better for it, you will be
