I'm hearing the light from the window I'm seeing the sound of the sea My feet have come loose from their moorings I'm feeling quite wonderfully free And I think I will travel to Rio Using the music for flight There's nothing I know of in Rio But it's something to do with the night It's only a whimsical notion To fly down to Rio tonight And I probably won't fly down to Rio But then again, I just might There's wings to the thought behind fancy There's wings to the thought behind play And dancing to rhythms of laughter Makes laughter the rhythm of rain And I think I will travel to Rio Using the music for flight There's nothing I know of in Rio But it's something to do with the night It's only a whimsical notion To fly down to Rio tonight And I probably won't fly down to Rio But then again, I just mightWell you and I Travel to the beat of a different drum Can't you tell by the way I run Every time you make eyes at me Yes, you cry and moan And say it'll work out But honey child I've got my doubts You can't see the forest for the trees Now don't get me wrong It's not that I knock it It's just that I am not in the market For a girl who wants to love only me And I'm not saying that you ain't pretty All's I'm saying's that I'm not ready For any person place or thing To try and pull the reins in on me Well I feel pretty sure that you'll find a man Who will take a lot more than I ever could or can And you'll settle down with him And I know that you'll be happy So goodbye, I'm a-leavin'I see no sense in you cryin' and grievin'We'll both live a lot longer If you live without meHer name was Joanne And she lived in a meadow by a pond And she touched me for a moment With a look that spoke to me of her sweet love Then the woman that she was Drove her on with desperation And I saw as she went A most hopeless situation For Joanne, and the man, and the time That made them both run She was only a girl I know that well, but still I could not see That the hold that she had Was much stronger than the love she felt for me But staying with her And my little bit of wisdom Broke down her desires Like a light through a prism Into yellows and blues and a tune That I could not have sung Though the essence is gone I have no tears to cry for her And my only thoughts of her are kindBeyond the blue horizon Waits a beautiful day Goodbye to things that bore me Joy is waiting for me I see a new horizon My life has only begun Beyond the blue horizon Lies a rising sun Beyond the blue horizon Waits a beautiful day Goodbye to things that bore me Joy is waiting for me I see a new horizon My life has only beguin Beyond the blue horizon Lies a rising sun Beyond the blue horizon Lies a rising sunSee the lazy windmill slowly turning Cutting up the marble canyons of the sky See the dust around my feet go churning Moving with the winds down the highways of goodbye Standing in the lonely light of the silver moon Looking over maps of memories for the road Standing in the lonely light of the silver moon With the unexpected destination of my home Half the thoughts I'm thinking speak in sighs As that same old wave of loneliness returns And I can see you when I close my eyes Speaking very softly as you turn Standing in the lonely light of the silver moon Looking over maps of memories for the road Standing in the lonely light of the silver moon With the unexpected destination of my home Now I must go Go and let goYou can't try to walk down two different roads And look to both of them to bring you home You must take your own way, though it is the long way And sometimes you find yourself alone I know, for this all happened once before Sometimes you think, "I'll wait,"But he who hesitates is lost, this is not just a game It's the problem of creation, and only meditation Can make your mind and age the same I know, for this all happened once before Go, Red!You'd better move along, don't wait and let the dawn And its friendly sunrise catch you at rest Do what you must, no man can criticize you As long as what you're doing is your best I know, for this all happened once before I know, for this all happened once beforeI've known for a long time The kind of girl you are Of a smile that covers tear drops The way your head yields to your heart Of things you've kept inside That most girls couldn't bear I've known you for a long time But I've just begun to care I've known of all the heartache And I've known of all the pain I've seen you when the sun shines And I've seen you when it rains I've seen you make a look of love From just an icy stare I've known you for a long time But I've just begun to care I know I've been blind To not have loved you all this time But the image of you wasn't clear I guess I've been standing too near Oh, it's taken me a while But I have finally found What you are to me And that's what really counts"Dance between the raindrops,"Were the last words that he said As I tumbled headlong into the storm So rising to the challenge I wrestled with the door Using what I thought was my good arm But there is no way in To where you already are There is no way out of everywhere No satisfaction can come To that which is fulfilled And all the lies will fall away with the cares Leave the door closed loosely So the messenger will know That it's all right to just walk in This fear that you've been feeling Has no substance of its own And though the battle rages fiercely, you will win Oh, there is no way in To where you already are There is no way out of everywhere No satisfaction can come To that which is fulfilled And all the lies fall away with the caresRight in the middle of the 10 cent scenery Shuffled and stacked on a postcard rack There's a cute little girl with a Shetland pony She smiles at me, but I can't smile back Cactus Jack drinks coffee black And tells me it's my lucky day Five o'clock in the Texas morning And I've come a long, long way Five o'clock in the Texas morning And I've come a long, long way She left me cold on a Winter's morning And cold it's been for a long, long time She told me Texas was where she's goin'And I came looking, but she's so hard to find Cactus Jack drinks coffee black Tells me it's my lucky day Five o'clock in the Texas morning And I've come a long, long way Five o'clock in the Texas morning And I've come a long, long wayI was overland touring in my new Ferrari At just about a hundred and ten I was on my way home from a sophisticated party Where I got a little drunk on gin And as the headlights cast a glow on the road I heard a voice inside of me It said, "You lost the light And now you're moving through the night Running from the grand ennui Running from the grand ennui"Well, I reached in my pocket and I pulled out the Omega That was never one second behind I knew the horse that I was running at the Southern Talladega Had won for the twenty-second time And then the countess I was with bent over with a kiss And put a jeweled hand on my knee I knew I'd lost the light And I was moving through the night Running from the grand ennui Running from the grand ennui Well that night passed in a blaze of glory With the countess and the car both mine And each day passes with the same old story But the countess has a brand new line
