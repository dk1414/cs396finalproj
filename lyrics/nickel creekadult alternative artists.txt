You don't owe me One more minute of your wasted time You act like it's all fine But all the years I gave you Thinking you knew that you wanted me I wanted to believe I've gotta make a destination Find where I belong This time I've got no hesitation And I'll be movin' on To where I belong I'll be movin' on I'm tired of trying To describe what you will never see How good we could be You gave up and lost it Now you're looking for a little grace Well look at my face I've gotta make a destination Find where I belong There ain't no time for hesitation I'll be movin' on To where I belong I'll be movin' on Over the line I've drawn I'm already gone I wish you out of the woods And into a picture with me I wish you over the moon Come out of the question and be If this is gonna Run 'round in my head I might as well be dreaming Run 'round in my head I roller coaster for you Time out of mind must be heavenly It's all enchanted and wild It's just like my heart said it Was gonna be If this is gonna Run 'round in my head I might as well be dreaming Run 'round in my headI am a lighthouse, worn by the weather and the waves I keep my lamp lit, to warn the sailors on their way I'll tell a story, paint you a picture from my past I was so happy, but joy in this life seldom lasts I had a keeper, he helped me warn the ships at sea We had grown closer, 'till his joy meant everything to me And he was to marry, a girl who shone with beauty and light And they loved each other And with me watched the sunsets into night And the waves crashing around me, the sand slips out to the sea And the winds that blow remind me Of what has been, and what can never be She'd had to leave us, my keeper he prayed for a safe return But when the night came The weather to a raging storm had turned He watched her ship fight But in vain against the wild and terrible wind In me so helpless, as dashed against the rock she met her endFlow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes Flow gently, I'll sing thee a song in thy praise My Mary's asleep by thy murmuring stream Flow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream Thou stock-dove whose echo resounds through the glen Oh, ye wild whistling blackbirds in yon thorny den Thou green-crested lapwing, thy screaming forebear Oh, I charge you disturb not my slumbering fair Oh, how lofty, sweet Afton, thy neighbouring hills Far marked with the courses of clear winding rills There daily I wander as noon rises high Oh, my flocks and my Mary's sweet cot in my eye How pleasant thy banks and green valleys below Where wild in the woodlands the primroses blow There oft as mild evening sweeps over the lea The sweet scented birch shades my Mary and me Oh, thy crystal stream, Afton, how lovely it glides And winds by her cot where my Mary resides How wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave As gathering sweet flowerets she stems thy clear waveYou got to leave me now, you got to go alone You got to chase a dream, one that's all your own Before it slips away When you're flyin' high, take my heart along I'll be the harmony to every lonely song That you learn to play When you're soarin' through the air I'll be your solid ground Take every chance you dare I'll still be there When you come back down When you come back down I'll keep lookin' up, awaitin' your return My greatest fear will be that you will crash and burn And I won't feel your fire I'll be the other hand that always holds the line Connectin' in between your sweet heart and mine I'm strung out on that wireOne day you'll see her and you'll know what I mean Take her or leave her, she will still be the same She'll not try to buy you with her time Nothing's the same as you will see when she's gone It's foreign on this side And I'll not leave my home again There's no place to hide And I'm nothin' but scared You dream of colors that have never been made You imagine songs that have never been played They will try to buy you and your mind For only the curious have something to find It's foreign on this side And the truth is a bitter friend Reasons few have I To go back again Your first dawn blinded you, left you cursing the day Entrance is crucial and it's not without pain There's no path to follow once you're here Climb up the slide and then you'll slide down the stairsHelena don't walk away Before you give me back my heart If it were mine it would be yours to take I'm sorry I let down my guard Oh Helena you looked so sweet I should have seen While I was playing for fun You were playing for keeps You win, I lose Is there some way you can leave me in your debt So my girl and I can live to die another day On that day I won't forget you Helena you'll look so sweet waiting for me While I wait for her to give me any reason to leave Don't waste your pretty sympathy She's gonna be just fine And Helena so will we So will everything in time Helena don't walk away Did you hear one word I said Oh well I never really liked us anyway And I forgot her I'll forget you Helena You're not that sweet and neither is she Go ahead and tell her anything you want'Cause Helena guys like me Never sleep alone at night I don't need your sympathy'Cause I'll always be just fine Yeah I'll always be just fine Yeah I'll always be just fineWhat will be left when I've drawn my last breath Besides the folks I've met and the folks who know me Will I discover a soul-saving love Or just the dirt above and below me I'm a doubting Thomas I took a promise But I do not feel safe Oh me of little faith Sometimes I pray for a slap in the face Then I beg to be spared cause I'm a coward If there's a master of death I bet he's holding his breath As I show the blind and tell the deaf about his power I'm a doubting Thomas I can't keep my promises Cause I don't know what's safe Oh me of little faith Can I be used to help others find truth When I'm scared I'll find proof that it's a lie Can I be led down a trail dropping bread crumbs To prove I'm not ready to dieLonely the life that once I led Strange the paths on which we tread Led me to you, unlikely but true Sabra girl, clouding my view Rainy the day the first time we met Deep was the talk, forever my debt It didn't seem wrong to sing a sad song Sabra girl, soon you'd be gone Early the morning and sad the goodbye With a wave of your hand and a smile of your eye So lately did meet no sooner to part Sabra girl, homeward must start Rosy the lines that you wrote with your hand Reading between them to misunderstand I made the mistake you said not to make Yes reading your letters conviction did grow I thought it a chance, I knew I must go It's hard to believe I could be so naive Sabra girl, flattered but deceivedThe fox went out on a chilly night He prayed for the moon to give him light For he had many a mile to go that night Before he reached the town-o, town-o, town-o He had many a mile to go that night before he reached the town-o He ran till he came to the farmers pen The ducks and the geese were kept therein He said: a couple of you are gonna grease my chin Before I leave this town-o, town-o, town-o A couple of you are going to grease my chin before I leave this town-o He grabbed the gray goose by the neck He threw a duck across his back And he didn't mind the quack-quack And the legs all danglin' down-o, down-o, down-o He didn't mind the quack-quack And the legs all danglin' down-o Well the old gray women jumped out of bed Out of the window she popped her head Cryin': John, John, the gray goose is gone The fox is on the town-o, town-o, town-o John, John the gray goose is gone and the fox is on the town-o He ran till he came to his nice warm den And there were the little ones eight, nine, ten Sayin' daddy, daddy, better go back again It must be a mighty fine town-o, town-o, town-o Daddy, daddy, go back again for it must be a mighty fine town-o
