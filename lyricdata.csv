45 Grave,1970s punk rock musicians,10,"Pity the poor little darling now Oh, she never had a chance Death came quick for the girl Victim of homicide Cut and beaten, brutally raped The five year old, she didn't escape Her mom and friend did her in Cigarette burns on the skin From her mom and her friend He had a whip, Do you wanna party  It's party time We gotta party  It's party time She never had a chance Her grandmother was sent to jail, her older sister Never loved, not for her time All night she sleeps, party time!Do you wanna party  It's party time We gotta party  It's party timeWhen the moon arises on the western sky And the vampires are out on the sly At times they have trouble finding necks to bite That's why I cook up in my roon tonight...My riboflavin flavored, non-carbonated, polyunsaturated blood Drac came to me one night at 12 And said the blood bank had no blood on the shelf I exclaimed ""don't fret!"" i'll give you on fix Of my newly regenerated mix I gave him riboflavin flavored, non-carbonated, polyunsaturated blood It gives you quick relief you see From fang aches and corpusle deficiency Natter  Consuming my laboratory brew Will make a new vampire out of you It's that quality unleaded, only one calorie, polyunsaturated blood That riboflavin flavored, non-carbonated, polyunsaturated blood Drac enjoyed my brew without a hitch Now he's one of those that would rather fight than switch If you're biting more necks enjoying it less Try my new non-carbonated best My riboflavin flavored, non-carbonated, polyunsaturated bloodWith absence of your lessons The

Abrasive Wheels,1970s punk rock musicians,10,"Got my marching orders in the morning post When I read the letter I thought it was a joke You gotta fight fight for what you want You gotta fight fight for what you want You gotta fight fight for what you want But why should we fight when the battle is yours I dont wanna fight in world war three Don't wanna fight the japanese Cos there's no honour in dying for the love of your country And who are you to tell me I gotta fight in a war It won't be the same as thirty nine in nineteen eighty fourPut Maggie Thatcher on the dole Strip her now of her roleOh when the punks go marching in, oh when the punks go marching in I wanna be in that number when the punks go marching in Oh when the skins go marching in, oh when the skins go marching in I

bombs falling From the sky Does it have to be this way That I die Attack, Attack, the world is black Attack, Attack, a nuclear attack Attack, Attack,nuclear warfare on you The kids have the power in their hands To venture out across the lands Guitars loud and voices proud No-one can crush the wall of sound Rebels armed with song and verse Their destiny to scour the earth Communicating through the airwaves Are you tuned-in to what they say Sonic Omen So you think its's quiet on these dirty streets But listen and you'll hear the beat You'll hear the weapons of the youth A thousand guitars to speak the truth Amps and drums in your front room Is this the answer to the gloom They have the power fast or slow To blow the speakers on your radio Sonic OmenAngry young voices cry, there's a new sun Burning in the sky Saying listen to your heart And not to the people tearing you apart The message is here upon our lips Listen for once, ignore your hip We hold the banner United hand in hand The banner of hope For a truce across the land This generation Holds the banner to the eyes of the nation Like two lovers reaching out In their minds no dark shadows Of dread or doubt We hold the banner United hand in hand The banner of hope For a truce across the landForgotten youth just waste away Sniffing glue to face the day Walking streets signing on Government schemes go on and on It's no use!It's no use!It's no use!Round and round I'm upside down I try to get up, you kick me down Vicious circle there's no hope Around my neck your like a rope Staticians, politicians you feed us crap

kicking me down When I should be out on the town All the things that I want keep on passing me by I can't get them out of my mind That girl's so horny, she's teasing me But what's on offer, it don't come cheap Life just keeps kicking me down When I should be out on the town All the things that I want keep on passing me by I can't get them out of my mindOur world is cut to pieces We are endangered species All this fighting, this warring, this constant friction We fight for so called order We send our sons and daughters All this bloodshed, this hatred, this f**king slaughter But there must be a way We can live without hate We don't have to fight for everything we've got Is this the price you want to pay They feed us propaganda Disguise the real agenda It's all about money, the arms deals, the oil you greed for It's time for all religions To live without division It's our choice, hear out voice, scream until they listen But there must be a way We can live without hate We don't have to fight for everything we've got Is this the price you want to pay Don't let the system tear us apart Open your eyes and you'll find your heart Be part of the cure and not the disease'cause how can you bleed if you ain't got a heart"

The Adverts,1970s punk rock musicians,10,"Life's short, don't make a mess of it To the ends of the earth, you'll look for a sense in it No chances, no plans I'll smash the windows of my box, I'll be a madman It's no time to be twenty-one To be anyone Hold back, see what you miss of it Out of the shadows, into the thick of it No maybes, no guessing I'm getting wound up, the plot sickens It's no time to be twenty-one To be anyone Strip down to the bare facts of it Into the cold heart, no hope and all that shit No chances, no plans I think I'll be somebody else or else a madman It's no time to be twenty-one To be anyone No-no-no-no-no-no No-no-no-no-no-noI'm lying in a hospital I'm pinned against the bed A stethoscope upon my heart A hand against my head They're peeling off the bandages I'm wincing in the light The nurse is looking anxious And she's quivering with fright Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes x4 The doctors are avoiding me My vision is confused I listen to my earphones And I catch the evening news A murderer's been killed And he donates his sight to science I'm locked into a private ward I realise that I must be Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes x4 I smash the light in anger Push my bed against the door I close my lids across the eyes And wish to see no more The eye receives the messages And sends them to the brain No guarantee the stimuli Must be perceived the same wayWe're talking into corners finding ways to fill the vacuum And though our mouths are dry we talk in hope to hit on something new Tied to the railway tracks, it's one way to revive but no way to relax We're just bored teenagers Looking for love or should I say emotional rages Bored teenagers Seeing ourselves as strangers We talk about the whys and wherefore, do we really care at all Talk about the frailty of words is rarely meaningful When we're sitting watching the 'planes burn up through the night like meteorites We're just bored teenagers Looking for love or should I say emotional rages Bored teenagers Seeing ourselves as strangers Bored teenagers Bored teenagers, oh yeahI wonder what we'll play for you tonight Something heavy or something light Something to set your soul alight I wonder how we'll answer when you say""We don't like you, go away Come back when you've learned to play""I wonder what we'll do when things go wrong When we're half-way through our favorite song We look up and the audience has gone Will we feel a little bit obscure Think we're not needed here We must be new wave, they'll like us next year We don't give a damn We don't give a damn We don't give a damnThe great British mistake was looking for a way out Was getting complacent, not noticing The pulse was racing The mistake was fighting The change, was staying the same It couldn't adapt so it couldn't survive Something had to give The people take a downhill slide into the gloom Into the darn recesses of their minds I swoop over your city like a bird I climb the high branches and observe Into the mouth, into the soul I cast a shadow that swallows you whole I swoop, I climb, I cling, I suck I swallow you whole String out the drip-feed, they're losing their world They're losing their hard boys and magazine girls Advert illegal, T.V  as outlaw, motive as spell They'll see the books burn  They'll be 451 It's people against things and not against each other Out of the pre-pack, into the fear, into themselves They're the great British mistake The genie's out of the bottle, call in the magician They didn't mean to free him, devil behind them Devil in the mirror, chained to their right hands They're the great British mistake They'll have to come to terms now, they'll take it out somehow They'll blame it all on something The British mistake -

maybe a fool for trusting Maybe - maybe a fool for following The god of wisdom, not of love But I'm riding with the new church I'm riding with the new church Relying on the new church And a new word Hang on - if you hang on to faith and meekness Before long, it's power for the strong It's twisted into something evil Something wrong So, I'm riding with the new church I'm riding with the new church Relying on the new church And a new word So long - goodbye to the blind and the weaklings Be strong - I'll do what I want I'll follow my feelings I'll go where they lead me Strength within you, not without you The new church needs youLeapfrog over fences Little time, less senses Here by this railway cutting Life goes quick and it goes without warning That's how life is in my bombsite dwelling But I don't believe you have to be an idiot To get somewhere these days I don't believe you have to sell your soul And do what everybody says Or get carried away Nowadays I fall among the empty shells and pray Give thanks - I'm happy where I am It's just as well Well, I thank God I never closed my eyes Thank God I never compromised Bombsite boy, the bombsite boy Thank God I wasn't mesmerized Bombsite boy, the bombsite boy - the bombsite boy There's a killer in your subway An anarchist on your street There's a breakdown on your T.V You can't find no relief In fact no feelings at all Your war is totally internal At least I'm sure that mine is - on the outside"
Agent Orange,1970s punk rock musicians,10,"They can make things worse for me Sometimes I'd rather die They can tell me lots of things But I can't see eye to eye Well, I know they know the way I think

I've lost my mind Things seem so much different now The scene has died away I haven't got a steady job And I've got no place to stay Well, it's a futuristic modern world But things aren't what they seem Someday you'd better wake up From this stupid fantasyThings don't seem to be as easy As they used to be It's getting harder every day To think of better things to say About what's going on around you And what's happening inside you When it's time to change, you won't know how It won't matter years from now No matter what you think, or do, or say Everything turns grey This is it, the darkest hour Isn't it depressing how our Minds create an atmosphere That won't happen here Unless we make some new demands To grasp the future in our hands You know, I wish I could But it's too late for senseless minds who love to hate No matter what they think, or do, or say Everything turns greyI'm sick of colored hair Don't care about what you wear I hate the things I see Don't care about anarchy I'm sick of boring bands Rock stars and all their fans The new wave overtones And all the leather jacket clones I'm so bored of you I'm sick of pins and chains Hard drugs and dizzy brains I'm sick of cheap romance People who never dance I'm sick of all the drunks The posers and the punks The stupid things they've done I'm getting sick of everyoneSometimes I think of old friends but they all seem the same Then I see them and they can't remember my name I guess I'm just like them, I guess I'm just a bore I could hate them but I've never done that before I've got lots of good friends I don't want any more Sometimes when you lie to me, sometimes I'll lie to you And there isn't a thing you could possibly do All these half destroyed lives aren’t as bad as the seem And then I see blood and I hear people scream Then I wake up and it's just another bad dream And I can't help myself by feeling sorry Because I gave up every chance I had It's not a movement, it's just another fad Like a cry for help in a world gone mad And I can't help myself by feeling sorry I know I gave up every chance I had It's not a movement, it's just another fad Like a cry for help in a world gone madI didn't expect them to know my name Surrounding me like a black steel frame I saw the world go up in flames And I just smiled and stood there, watching And it doesn't seem like this is real That's just the way I feel I don't know why Well, I learned from my mistakes This time, I will escape I'm too young to die We're all too young to die It doesn't seem like this is real I guess it's just the way I feel

see eye to eye Well, I know they know the way I think I know they always will But someday I'm gonna change my mind Sometimes I'd rather kill Bloodstains, speed kills Fast cars, cheap thrills Rich girls, fine wine I've lost my sense, I've lost control, I've lost my mind Things seem so much different now The scene has died away I haven't got a steady job And I've got no place to stay Well, it's a futuristic modern world But things aren't what they seem Someday you'd better wake up From this stupid fantasyThings don't seem to be as easy As they used to be It's getting harder every day To think of better things to say About what's going on around you And what's happening inside you When it's time to change, you won't know how It won't matter years from now No matter what you think, or do, or say Everything turns grey This is it, the darkest hour Isn't it depressing how our Minds create an atmosphere That won't happen here Unless we make some new demands To grasp the future in our

Amebix,1970s punk rock musicians,9,"Desperation took us down Uneasy lies, the head But where's the crown You can't see it I saw the mourners passing by These wicked men Beneath the sulfurous skies Oh what can it mean Every bell is silent here The hands of clocks are bound And time itself has stopped Can you feel it The birds are frozen in their flight Trapped within the thunder light A storm is rising A voice within the winter halls Some grave secret from these careless lips will fall A star on the horizon See you gods forgotten son Lies broken and alone Searching for a father From Dresden's blazing skies To the bloody wash of dawn I saw the beast arise And climb upon the throne And fallen angels weep And long for peace, for home Whilst far beneath the ice they sleep These dark knights of the black sun And upon stromlashed mountain high I found the hidden book On the altar of the wretched prince of lies And I broke apart the graven seal And these seven words I read Rejoice, the great god fear is dead So from the rooftops calling out You where always free Yes from the rooftops calling out And ever may you beWell, we've all heard the sermon Seen the preachers or worshiped the stage Heard the new manifesto  It's all questions no solutions at all Well, you're out on your own now, always have been Just look at your friends Break the surface to daylight Strength will flow through our unity There is a traitor in our midst And when we rise we will be betrayed They are the wolves in sheep's clothing Take the place at the back of the fold All this talk about freedom Will be

revolution on the wind Well, we're grinding down our axes Telling tales round the bonfire at night We will set out with a fire in our hearts When this darkness gives way to the dawn In the light we're united as one For the kingdom of heaven must be taken by storm You're standing on a hill, looking down at the city Thinking 'bout your life and your bottle of pills They released you from the hospital, you're cured!So this is how freedom feels Largactyl Relax Feel a little numb  Feel a little tired Your brain's asleep and your body's retired You've learned to fit in  O BE Y!You're just a shadow of what you used to be Largactyl Relax A comfortable life  A car and a wife It's only a dream but it's fuckin' obscene You've learned to fit in, a vegetable!Senility  At 21 they'll be coming

Legion left, and with them took the dying light Once more the land became a wilderness of supertitious night And from the forest deep came tales of children reared by wolves The mother raped and left in shame whilst in the womb They dreamed revenge They are murderous, and they come for us Between the beast and man we die Here come the wolf They are murderous, and they come for us Between the beast and man we die Here come the wolf A message came, a plea for help against the beast But no-one came and night on night the forest rang With chilling cries, as decimation took its course Oh Gods have mercy of our souls, with every night the terror comes See how they run They are murderous, and they come for us Between the beast and man we die Here come the wolf They are murderous, and they come for us At night we hear the children cry Here come the wolfWe came out of the night Bloodied but unbowed from days We always will remember And by the morning light We look upon the risen dawn The day of our creation I see my enemies And I know the way, the way I will defeat them And in such days as these I see the circle turning to completion These days will never come again These days will never come again These days will never come again These days will never come againAxeman Lock up your children, the axeman is coming Lock up your children, the axeman is coming Lock up your children, the

parchment of my flesh must break The winter winds my soul doth take And all beneath the heavens lies in peace A world will form and fade away The crystal dawn of the final day Breaks upon the shores of death's release Bring me my flesh and blood On land, the sky, the sea And light a raging fire upon the hearth Gather round 'neath the cloak of time And drink a toast to these Our final days upon this earth We made the deserts from the gardens of our youth We spewed our blackened hearts into the sea Through darkened skies and poisoned clouds We blindly grope for truth We couldn't see the forest for the trees To my wretched son I leave this gun To slaughter all your race For this, the beast you have become I have no longer taste And daughter fair with burning hair The swamp of life be thine And watch as e'en the great will mate With the lowliest of swine To breed the sons, the greed and scum Of this your ravaged land All my estates, both small and great Shall fall beneath your hand"

First-night nerves every one-night stand I should be glad to be so inclined What a waste  What a waste!But the world don't mind I could be a lawyer with stratagems and ruses I could be a doctor with poultices and bruises I could be a writer with a growing reputation I could be the ticket-man at Fulham Broadway station I could be the catalyst that sparks the revolution I could be an inmate in a

Christian Death,1970s punk rock musicians,10,"Burning crosses on a nіgger's lawn Burning dollars, what's a house without a home Dance in your white sheet glory Dance in your passion You talk about sugar on the six-fingered beast Conversations about the holes in your hands Walk through the garden of man's desires Conversations about the kingdom of fire Conversations about the kingdom of fire What's that moving in the basement What's that moving in the attic Who's that walking in the shadows Who's that walking in the streets Kiss on my hand After dark, hand for a kiss After dark, kiss on my hand Kiss on my hand Kiss on my hand Romance in sequence, harmful to the blind Burning hearts through the top of your skull Dance in your white sheet glory Dance in your passion Your days are numbered with creations in your pocket Your days are numbered with the love in your eyes The love in your eyes LoveIncurable disease on the day of rest I'm walking on water in a sea of incest I've got the image of Jesus embedded in my chest I can't leave home without my bullet-proof vest Killing myself for the perfect honeymoon Fighting with scorpions tied 'round my neck I hear the pitter-patter of a killer on the loose Children use their fingers instead of words Crosses burn our temples on Slaughter Avenue It takes too much time for me to say I refuse Time is digging graves for the chosen few Children dig the graves of me and you Describe the illness, I'll prescribe the cure Start your two-day life on a two-day vacation Describe the illness, I'll prescribe the cure Start your two-day life on a two-day vacation Spiritual cramp going for my ribs Those gangsters toting guns are shooting spikes through my wrist Children use their fingers instead of words Fingers bury children under the boards I can die a thousand times, but I'll always be here With the powder skull secrets of forgotten years The hangman's noose is drenched with bloodstained tears My hands are the killers that confirm my fears Jesus won't you touch me  Come into my heart Where the Hell are you when the fire starts Let's skirt the issue of discipline Let's start an illusion With hand and pen Re-read the words and start again Accept the gift of sin The gift of...Pleasure is bleeding to smother my words The four walls drain me dry Of all imagination Crying out to be told to stand still Crying out to be told to stand still The price of red death is the price of true love The knights of red death are the knights that you love The price of red death is the price of true love The knights of red death are the knights that you love The black queen jumps through my skin The king of hearts is waiting Close to home Someone's shooting outside Trigger finger's itching Another moving target More blood on your surplice More blood for the price of red deathIn the shallow holes of a thousand eyes In the knee-deep graves of future survivors The fleshless guests live off children of the past And their aging fingers cast the shadow of death Their razor-sharp tongues invite to relax As they slip the skin of your eyelids back Invasive spectators get into the act With roses and candles, silver knives and Persona-read women dance with priests on a side road Your vision perspectives are turning to stone Cabaret slideshow stars shooting their loads Act one is the end and the show now begins...Their razor-sharp tongues invite to relax As they slip the skin of your eyelids back Invasive spectators get into the act With roses and candles, silver knives and Breath ballet prancers spin on porcelain backbones A child's muddled cry turns into hilarity Ungracious freeloaders leave their dead on a doorstep Flowers of doom all bloom in prosperityFresh night, hounded by the head Very dark placid sky hangs above No moon shining like an untouched ass of the boy next door Beginning to feel the first impressions of a strange drug Set the leathery skin of a female, straddling a furnace Illuminates in blue Hands melt against the burning surface But feel no pain, kiss the burner, lips fall away Blood runs down the insides of her thighs She tightens her grip in one last exaggerated movement Then falls to the ground a pile of ashes The burner stands triumphant over the mound And next in line, a young boy approaches And is assaulted by the flames Shooting out like sharp tongues of hungry animals Of a hungry animal The disciple now crouches in the belly of God His second skin removed, the boy lay sodomized and tired Sodomized and tired Pleasure-seekers abandon new disguises Threatening our existence with their faces In the corner of the room I sit and I praySevlesmeth pleh ohw esoht spelh dog Sevlesmeth pleh ohw esoht spelh dog Dog Ereth si on ytic fo dog Ereth si on ytic fo dog

mind is set at ease Number the models, spreading disease Nodding to acquaintances to be sure Making 'Him' a household word I'll introduce realism, the eye of the beholder The final resting places of Many would-be heroes In New York City park after dark The time of clinical death is fixed Death is fixed Don't be frightened Necrophiliac relationship During the freezing process Note the murders, grisly attitude Crossed above my head to protect it from the rocks Palliations for a weaker sex Palliations for a weaker sex Palliations for a weaker sex Palliations for a weaker sex I'm avoiding what I can see Dreaming about her mother dyingThe ceremony cradles my head in trance I brush dust from my teeth Fleeing hands and spiders plead for salvation They wash the clawed feet of a priest Ritual mockery, rectified doubt I'm holding with arms open wide Sleeping endless sleep on a bed of nails Wake me up with your kiss I'm waiting for confirmation I'm waiting for confrontation I'm waiting for contemplation Waiting for a place to lay my body down The proud encasings of another's soul Buried deep 'neath the shroud Flourished with the venom of a serpent's son I close my eyes, retreat The prayer hand lays down on the edge of my sleep Sister Death in leper's guise Through crimson eyes of the Holy One Everyone will learn to see I'm waiting for confrontation I'm waiting for contemplation I'm waiting for confirmation Waiting for a place to lay my body downI've come to lie beside you I've come to know the dark for light I've come to trust just one And that one died with yesterday With yesterday Now that I ve laid me down to sleep For what it's worth, I dress my tears in costumes Never again will we, will I turn to stone The drowning edges of my pillow Catch the last breath On a desert leading down The breath too deep, the breath too long ago forgotten I've come to lie beside you I've come to know the dark for light I've come to trust just one And that one died with yesterday With yesterday Now that all honest clocks bury oceans with sand Our tears have filled them once again When will I, will we stand at the shore To cleanse our souls To cleanse our souls Are memories too deep Are memories too long ago forgotten Now that I've left that chance to die I see the end, I see the end Well it was open so I crawled inside And someone up ahead was crying Well someone up ahead was dying Lost in the darkness, lost in today...You can only lose it to your mind, you got to lose it to your mind Waves and waves of tranquility is hard on your innocence Discarding all that was before, Let's crawl inside...La virginal souls devour without shame We lick our lips clean, so clean No one outside knows, no one outside knows what it means To me, to be, set free You can only lose it to your mind, you got to lose it to your mind Waves and waves of tranquility is hard on your innocence Discarding all that was before, Let's crawl inside..

Wanna have a laugh before the press get in If you give'em half a chance They'll kill the fucking thingNo matter what the people say This song leads the way It's all of the play From the boss D JI can't see it Right from the top To the very last drop Where the hell is babylon Where the hell is Babylon  I just wanna know Heard so much about the place and now i wanna go Where the hell is Babylon  Does such a place exist Is it real, or is it a myth, or is it back there in the mist Alright!Where the hell is Babylon  I wanna go today But before I leave the house I've gotta know the way Where the hell is Babylon  I've heard it's lots of fun Can i get there on me bike, or straight up the M1 Alright  Lets Go  Alright  Lets Go  Where the hell is Babylon!?SoloYou're walking along quietly There's the sound of running feet You turn around the corner There's fighting on the street See all the kids they wanna good time They all wanna get stuck in Don't know, don't care If they're fighting for a cause AS long as they get one in Go We're fighting in the streets You all look for solutions But you can rack your brains No matter what the gov't do Its never ever gonna change Wankers hand hand out leaflets They'll never ever let it be I don't care what they do But they better not come near me Go We're fighting in the streetsThis is a new song Out with the old This is a new way New truth to be told Don't wanna sing about a factory I ain't something that appeals to me Don't wanna be part of the disco craze And all them bands who wanna change their ways Don't wanna sing about The governments ploys I just wanna make a noise Let me show you what it's all about It's gotta be raucous, one big shout"
James Chance and the Contortions,1970s punk rock musicians,10,"It's better than pleasure, it hurts more than pain But I've got what it takes to drive you insane Now is the time to lose all control Distort your body, oh, twist your soul, oh Contort yourself, oh, contort yourself Hey, baby, you better twist it, oh You'll never, never, never resist it Contort yourself, contort yourself, oh Hey, baby, don't you stick together and one of you just fall apart You better try bein' stupid, oh, instead of smart And once you take out all the garbage that's in your brain Forget about your future 'cause it's just, just, just, just too tame, oh Contort yourself, oh Oh, I said you got to I said you got to, you got to, you got to You got to contort yourself, oh Oh At first, you arrive in position and then you shatter your frame And then you stretch your resistance until your mind slips away And once you forget your affection for the human race Reduce yourself to zero and, baby, then you'll fall right in place, ohI stumbled into an empty trap I said I'm gonna cut you off With just one way, a slap I got no need to tell you Just how it feels All I want from you Is to give up what you steal You got nothing to show And you know it You're made of all I hate I can taste it I can't hurt you enough But do you feel it You're useless Ain't got no excuses You're designed to kill All that screaming's gonna rub off on you They're gonna strip you raw And beat you for your And I don't care what weapons you use Just as long as you keep me amusedI don't wanna be happy I said I like living a lie The bright brittle smiles Are gleaming and white About their colourless crime I could break them in two with the glint of my eye I don't want you to know me Unless you are shallow or sly When choosing my friends I always depend on them Like charades in disguise Once I figure them out they're a waste of my time I only live on the surface I don't think people are very pretty inside And my idea of fun Isn't having a son Or being whipped on the back of my thighs I prefer the ridiculous to the sublimeSick of being on the losing end I'm tired, I'm tired of playing the obliging friend Extort, extort my emotions all you like I'll lap it all, I'll lap it all up and I'll spit it right back I wanna dish it out!Ow  Want your heart for casual wear Want you to grasp at my straws And see if I care I said, I, I, I wanna see some emotion Not the usual fluff I wanna be the one to tell you When to start and when you've had enough Dish it out!I am a hopeless case I've failed every test And just like that, I got no sales resistance Now you got me obsessed I'll preserve you now And pay you back later I want to cramp your style, crocodile See you later, see you later alligatorCan't tell the difference between the face And your infection I'm running out You're sinkin' in, be my reflection I love to tremble, these are my membranes Let me inject ya around your throat Inside your eyes then I'll inspect ya Can't stand myself, throw me away Oh well, my emotions, it made me alter It deflates my passion, my hungry worship Is just one more shackle you can't fasten It better absorb me while I transmit Expletive spasms before you tumble In blind abandon into my castle Can't stand myself, throw me awayMy infatuation Dry intoxication You just come near me when you're asleep Pretend I'm not true Deceive you When I reel you You're only me Subconscious treasure Unconscious pleasure Wondrous sensation Pale creation My amputation My assassination My infatuationYou are the Marquis de Sade You want your guns to go pop You want your hot boys and chocolate centres I can't, no I won't I love to talk So if you want me to walk you better find the spot that's not tender I'm not a bedroom athlete Baby I'm not toilet trained I need to put you out I need to be restrained If you want quick service You better use a pump If you like hard wood You better better, ah, you better use a stump Hit me Girl you're polished to a high gloss You want someone to play boss You want to tell me what orders to give you I can't wear your disguise I'm too over-officialised I won't be your slave unless you will be mineTighten my skin I freeze inside Don't you dare let me melt You better caress my pride I'm under glass Stare if you please You better behave Wait at my ease You can bite me But not delight me I've known of all What you call love I'm all dressed up For you to carve You better eat all you like I'd rather starveBetter take what you can I got a roving eye You can't leave me wet I said you better wring me dry And baby do you think I made it with my most size You better do what you what you're told You better just get wise Roving eye And you're oh so dissolute Don't you be so flattered if I think you're cute There's only one of me There's a million of you If you can't fake it I said anyone else will do Roving eye I don't trust my intuition I don't place any bets Don't ask nothing from no one My feelings never connect I don't believe in a better world Baby I'm stuck with you Cause I'd rather take my turnI've been washed out and left to dry There's nothing left for you to buy I only want what's dry and smooth I only like things twice removed I devoured you before but I've gone sour You want more, I blame my nerves I'm a lot but I deserve what I got So you better hold me at bay Erase me for another day And when it's time to send me home I'll drain your eyes and claim your bones"

adversary I am the adversary I am your foe I go where you go Between ideals and fact Between the thought and the act You sink without trace Grow to hate your face Will you sell all you own To sit in a

explained This road is my road This road is your road This road is Our road You'll get lost those woods I got lost in those woods The woods could be thick and tall And the woods were thick and tall There will be nothing at all And there was nothing at all This road is my road This road is your road This road is Our road The Last Dictator to the station crept In tattered clothes he lay down and wept Shook his fists at all the world and hissed'Is this it, is this it My farewell delegation These few trees This station that is no station That is left, that is mine I could have saved you all You gave me so little time'Well the Angels who'd hung around And dreamed their dreams For eternity they'd schemed their schemes Awoke and said 'Dick, we understand you to the letter But you could have it like it was before, only better''Yes, I'd like that - I'd try again But will you make them bow and honor my name ''Oh yes, by comparison the last time will seem rather tame We'll set you up in the desert In a discotheque called Parody, that's French for paradise Like an immovable spot, rest now you've had a rough trot'The Last Dictator woke from where he'd been In a mood that was mean, he

that I had left a ditch inside er Her head is liker her room It has no order And I felll away I watched her jam a fork right up into her arm And I saw her slip away Slip away slip away Th hollow that I partied on Filled up that space inside her Rose Blue I saw the sky turn Rose Blue The curtains the walls the lock on the door Locked us in together Bu the things she said When I fell asleep, went to bed Well I was deaf to that tune She started to wear those long blue sleeves Oh they saw her through me When I planted that need When I see that damaged place inside her I opened that wound opened

secret lies, are top stilts of lies I tripped her through the empty streets To hold you close beneath linen sheets Inside that vanity room I suffocate in pharaoh's tomb Just a beggar and a thief Holding on to the suspension of disbelief Just a beggar and a thief A siren and her song And beneath the tiring rain A breath linger by loss and by pain I get with you beneath the stellar sky I felt the tears behind your eyes Beyond good and evil Beyond right and wrong Beyond good and evil Beyond right and wrong In the tiring rain You're my baby againThe whole family took the car Bought machine

was old and full of sin The good cop came and smashed it in Another one’s down Another one’s down Shoot him now Shoot him now Well this tenement slum is full of losers And losers can’t be choosers No

clambered ashore It was a one-sided, self-righteous war'Your shark', they swore'He is no more'Oh shark Since the sun has refused to rise To wake is an unwelcome surprise The trees no longer recognize their fruit The trees no longer recognize their fruit Oh Shark what have we done What have you done with the sun You put the sun before the darkness Is this the winter of the fall You put the summer before the darkness Is this the winter of our fall Oh Shark Who is this God Before whim every man is made to cower I feel ashamed And the simple things come harder now I doubt my legs My words My every move Oh Shark I called down into the sea But I have lost your soul And you would not answer me Oh Shark I prayed unto the sea To deliver you unto me But the waters lay still They would not part I lost hope I lost my heart My friend the Shark You put the sun before the darkness Is this the winter of the fall You put the summer before the darkness Is this the winter of our fall You put the summer before the darkness Is this the winter of our fall You put the summer before the darkness Is this the winter of our fallThat night he foretold his enemies' doom His words loomed large across the room They boomed His pupils were quiet and well groomed With swelling heart He began his favourite part When Eve, who since she wed Had gained a lot of weight From the apples on which she fed It was compensation she said For the marginal life that she'd led Zig-zagged through the door And said, 'Adam what's this button for'No more door"

You're not blank, so baby we're through With the flowers in your hair That proves there's nothing under there Peace and love for free They don't mean a thing to me You're not blank, so baby we're through The way you changed and rocked too long Summer of Love is ten years gone And knowing ten years, baby, I'll be gone But right now, right now You wanna be mellow It's just another word for

then you fall into another dark depression, your eyes turn teary before you start the session As you hold the knife you say “this will fix it all, the new scars will never be discovered if the slits are small,” and then once again you puncture your skin One can only think what you wonder within, you have something near to help wipe the blood away, in your life this is just like any other day, you hate life you can't wait for morality, as self harm is now your escape from reality You cover up the pain, from those who’ve made you cry, it’s time to realize, that you are not alone, so put away the blade, only you can change your ways, its time to heal the wounds, there’s someone who loves you Tears stream out like a current in a river, you try to self-reflect but theres nothing in the mirror, your life just seems to crumble and fall to pieces, your questioning the purpose of life and all its reasons“why am I alive the world is better without me, I already know theres no one out there to help me”, then you remember how to take the pain away, as you think “I’ll use this razor blade on my vein today”So you line the knife up amongst all the other scars, you push it down and pull it back and make another fast, a couple minutes pass the blood is draining from your wrist, and you still haven’t asked what your gaining from this risk Instead you live the moment cus you feel your in control, that blade of steel is how you get some healing in your soul, you ignore all the blood line the knife up once again, think to yourself “life sucks” then it ends You cover up the pain, from

bounce a few around Three bullets through your skull, kid is what you'll go without They bring us up as sinners And they want us all to preach I didn't have an out at all Can't we go out, get sober this time I'm high on victimization and sublime poetry There's thoughts I want to optimize to a certain level of debrisOh oh oh oh is that the way I dont even wanna play the game It's not ok I feel so corrupt Every day i'm running out of light Everyone who knows me, knows I never ever wanna fight My words are my knives but I haven't really sharpened 'em It's been a long while since I picked up a book and read Attend to my needs god I need a cosmic helping hand I've been through black and blue and grey, but it's all turning red again And my mind is my enemy, number one I swear I ain't no sinner I just hide behind Anything i can while my demons hand in hand running around me in a circle Asking me to let them in And then,and then it all goes back to black And I can hear them whisper bout me Don't you ever doubt her she is nothing but a darkling Trust me she a heavy one, she our little baby blue She's the saddest fucking creature that i've ever witnessed She gon' do our bidding, she gon' lose her feelings, she will give us corpses in piles I'll be damned if hell don't rise Kill whatever's in your path, hurt whoevers in your reach Naaa man, satan , don't you ever fucking trust

me when you say Hurts me when you say you're all alone Because i'm right here you used to gaze at me like I was home Say goodbye all this dead weight I wouldn't want you near my casket I'm a basket case Disease, no ease I can't find breeze I rid myself of vanities from west to east I feel so high right now, there's only down from here They're waiting at the bottom, yeah they long to feed On my breaking bones I'm shaking still So I will stay high and I will try to be still I don't even care if you want me to heal Time to kill, kill ,kill I was standing, staring at trees I was stranded, down on my knees Begging for forgiveness and world peace All I was left with are words that I can't speak Broken, beaten down bruised I was hoping it was all just a ruse It's all in front of you don't you see Damnation, quarantine Can you tell  can you help me sail away When you look do you see what they want you to In your head mixing pieces of imagination, twisting them with reality have no fear they are near they aspire to be the voice within your head Hello light, am I your greatest creation No more fight in me We have reached retardation What more, what more can we build Isn't it everything you thought it would be Are you well Kept In the shadows shed your shell You have lost all your mellow and marvel look straight at me Are you happy with your memories Angel vs  devil fighting in my head

class warfare The only thing I care about's theYeah, standing on the deck, I watch my shadow stretch The sun pours my shadow upon that deck The water's lickin' 'round my ankles now There ain't no sunshine way, way down I see the sharks are in the water like slicks of ink Well, there's one there bigger than a submarine As he circles, I look in his eye I see Jonah in his belly by the campfire light Oh, an albatross up in the windy lofts Yeah, he's beating his wings while he sleeps it off I hear the jettisoned cries from his dreams unkind Yeah, they're whipping my ears like a riding crop Well, the captain once as able as a fink dandy He's now laid up in the galley like a dried-out mink He's laying dying of thirst and he says, or I think""Well, we're gonna be alone from here on in""Yeah, you're all my brothers and you have been kind But what were you expecting to find Now your eyes turn inward, countenance turn blank And I'm floating away on a barrel of pain It looks like nothing but the sea and sky would remainI can hear a Jericho Trumpet But the sky's perfectly clear Whether it’s real or recollection It’s like I'm stranded on a pier Watching waves of emigration Being rewound off the beach While the long road to unconsciousness Ebbs out at my heels Now I'm walking the halls of Charles de Gaulle With a fresh-minted boarding pass I got a date with Ben-Gurion Standing in a subway I'm feeling like I've overstayed I'm waiting with my sack for the Amtrak And a ticket out of J FK I didn't do anything I didn’t do nothing I didn’t say a thing Still not a wordHere, the sun's giving way and the last of its shade's Grown as long as the ache that you gave me Yeah, you said nothing's perfect, though you came pretty close But then time's made the most of you lately Only now you feel more like you're up for the cause Like you've had second thoughts And your heart's lost its thrust, you're marooned on the moon And you need livening up But why come back for me  I ain't no great beauty Well, I guess you've got time on your hands It ain't no big deal, me being lost at sea'Til you start losing blood on the sand To think I To think that I once loved you To think I To think that I once loved you I know that corridor where your nerves pave the floor And the walls waterfall all around you You're all made out of glue, just a residue And I've taken your place and I'm feeling brand new Yeah, right, nothing here's perfect, I am totally sold I've been dragged 'cross the coals a lot lately I don't wanna ruin your fun but you got your refund And now I'm paid to make rain where you burnt meThe best songs are like bad dreams If you can cover all the exits But one by one they blur And you’re forgetting all the words By the time you get to breakfast A reckoning election A politician's corkscrew A credit card mini bar private rental car And a Western education12 square feet of dirty day The whole world made to order I’m either taking up more space Than I have taken up before Or the days are getting shorter Now I’m smoking in a blindfold In an Indonesian courtyard I always thought ‘bout quitting But then there’s the reptilian And his business is to die hard But now I’m feeling kinda free I’m going straight to D VD I’m losing my ambition Going into remission I've put it all behind meThe 'burbs are growing like a fingernail Slower than the dullest pain I want the hunger and cold of the nights of old When there was blood up to the Himalayas I’m saying farewell to the welfare state The only comfort is a caliphate I'm guessing war sure beats any old

Yeah, I love you like a violin I'll hunt you like an amputee But I ain't gonna lose my skin I would love to see you again Again.. We don't write letters anymore There ain't the time or place But a friend of mine wrote something Like a letter yesterday It was smuggled through my inbox Just this morning, 3:00am More impotent than important Let me read it now, verbatim He says, ""I got that same old feeling The one that turns the birds to brutes The sky is like a bad dream And the earth is in cahoots I don't believe no one no more I don't care what no one says I just want to make the world A much less painful place And we look fonder on the good old days As they drift further away But why, if everyone feels so homesick Are they always settin' sail 'Cause it's all bad news up there on deck And each headland masks the next I'd just as soon dive in the ocean And forgo the blood and sweat And forgo all aspirations They just put everyone at odds If idle hands are the Devil's work Then where's the time for God's ""I see seaweed on the lawn There's no point coming here no more Do you remember way back when When weeks sank in the swimming pool Holidays were cotton wool Your bald tyre friends, the pelicans, cowboys and indians Admit it, she was kinda cute Her panties were your parachute They found her near the airport, in a crater, near the bend Where she and I'd walk by the zoo Not knowing we'd do what all plagues do I forget her all the time these days and be forgotten too We're lockstepping in our billions Lockstepping in our swarms Lockstepping in the certainty that more need to be born I was fine but not the whole time, see I fiddled while Rome stewed, and lord It choked my heart, but spades are spades My head's here now to tell you We're lockstepping in our billions Lockstepping in our swarms Lockstepping in the certainty that more need to be bornOne Sunday morning While I was out walking By the Brisbane's waters I chanced to stray There I found a prisoner Layed half in the water He'd seen me coming And he began to say""I was a native of Erin's Ireland And before I was brought To this terrible place They dragged me away From my wife and newborn And my ailing parents I've been a prisoner at Port Macquarie Norfolk Island and Emu Plains At Castle Hill and cursed Toongabbie At all of these settlements I've worked in chains But of all the places of condemnation At each penal station of New South Wales To Moreton Bay I've found no equal The tyranny there makes all the rest pale There I met O'Brien The defender from Ulster He'd left Ireland burning Came here for the wake He was a schemer A Jacobite nightmare He could not be broken But he became displaced The Jew had one hand He was a violent man He'd worn the 20 pound irons Since before time began Just before the dawn broke His starvation awoke He'd pick the corn from the filth He'd find laying around There ain't no walls at all So remote is the North The Commandant Logan Was the devil for sure His chief flogger was mad I heard a prison guard say He'd wash his lash in a bucket Then drinks the remains"

Susanne stå och gestikulera Jag har gått här i tjugo år snart Men med en kpist är det svårt att diskutera Jag gick långsamt hemåt Hemåt den kvällen Skulle jag få se henne igen Hjärnan värkte Hjärtat värkte Skulle jag bli hel igen En dag så stod Så stod den bara där En mur mellan mig och den jag hade kär Vi bor två kvarter ifrån varann Men en grå prick är det enda jag ser av Susanne Vi skulle få leva här Vi skulle få leva här Vi skulle få leva här Vi skulle få le—leva härKapitalet höjer hyrorna Och staten bostadsbidragen Så kan man fiffla en smula Med den järnhårda lönelagen Och till och med betala mindre i lönÄn priset för mat och för hyra För staten skjuter så gärna till Om levnadsomkostnaderna blivit Allt för dyra Sida vid sida, tillsammans hjälps dom åt Staten och kapitalet, dom sitter i samma båt Fast det är inte dom som ror, som ror så svetten lackar Och piskan som kittlar, kittlar inte heller Deras feta nackar Skolans uppgift är som sig bör Att skola arbetskraften Om kvastarna skall sopa bra Får man inte slarva med skaften Spärrar och kvoter och testprogramÄr ett system för att sålla Agnarna från vetet och för var o en Till hans rätta fålla Sida vid sida, tillsammans stryker de fram Staten och kapitalet, två vargar fromma som lamm Fast det är inte dom som ror, som ror så att svetten lackar Och piskan som kittlar, kittlar inte heller Deras feta

Elvis Costello,1970s punk rock musicians,10,"She may be the face I can't forget A trace of pleasure or regret May be my treasure or the price I have to pay She may be the song that summer sings May be the chill that autumn brings May be a hundred different things Within the measure of a day She may be the beauty or the beast May be the famine or the feast May turn each day into a heaven or a hell She may be the mirror of my dreams A smile reflected in a stream She may not be what she may seem Inside her shell She who always seems so happy in a crowd Whose eyes can be so private and so proud No one's allowed to see them when they cry She may be the love that cannot hope to last May come to me from shadows of the past That I'll remember till the day I dieDon't start that talking I could talk all night My mind goes sleepwalking While I'm putting the world to right Call careers information Have you got yourself an occupation Oliver's army is here to stay Oliver's army are on their way And I would rather be anywhere else But here today There was a Checkpoint Charlie He didn't crack a smile But it's no laughing party When you've been on the murder mile Only takes one itchy trigger One more widow, one less white nigga Oliver's army is here to stay Oliver's army are on their way And I would rather be anywhere else But here todayI've been on tenterhooks, ending in dirty looks Listening to the Muzak, thinking 'bout this 'n' that She said that's that, I don't wanna chitter-chat Turn it down a little bit or turn it down flat Pump it up when you don't really need it Pump it up until you can feel it Down in the pleasure center, hell-bent or heaven sent Listen to the propaganda, listen to the latest slander There's nothing underhand that she wouldn't understand Pump it up until you can feel it Pump it up when you don't really need it Hey!She's been a bad girl, she's like a chemical Though you try to stop it, she's like a narcotic You wanna torture her, you wanna talk to her All the things you bought for her, could not get a temperatureOh, my baby, baby I love you more than I can tell I don't think I can live without you And I know that I never will Oh, my baby, baby I want you so it scares me to death I can't say anymore than ""I love you""Everything else is a waste of breath I want you You've had your fun, you don't get well no more I want you Your fingernails go dragging down the wall Be careful, darling, you might fall I want you I woke up, and one of us was crying I want you You said: ""Young man, I do believe you're dying""I want you If you need a second opinion as you seem to do these days I want you You can look in my eyes and you can count the waysOh, it's so funny to be seeing you after so long, girl And with the way you look, I understand that you are not impressed But I heard you let that little friend of mine Take off your party dress I'm not going to get too sentimental Like those other sticky valentines'Cause I don't know if you were loving somebody I only know it isn't mine Alison, I know this world is killing you Oh, Alison, my aim is true Well, I see you've got a husband now Did he leave your pretty fingers lying in the wedding cake You used to hold him right in your hand I'll bet he took all he could take Sometimes, I wish that I could stop you from talking When I hear the silly things that you say I think somebody better put out the big light'Cause I can't stand to see you this way Alison, I know this world is killing you Oh, Alison, my aim is trueI was tuning in the shine on the light night dial Doing anything my radio advised With every one of those late night stations Playing songs, bringing tears to my eyes I was seriously thinking about hiding the receiver When the switch broke 'cause it's old They're saying things that I can hardly believe They really think we're getting out of control Radio is a sound salvation Radio is cleaning up the nation They say you better listen to the voice of reason But they don't give you any choice'Cause they think that it's treason So you had better do as you are told You better listen to the radio I wanna bite the hand that feeds me I wanna bite that hand so badly I want to make them wish they'd never seen me Some of my friends sit around every evening And they worry about the times ahead But everybody else is overwhelmed by indifference And the promise of an early bed You either shut up or get cut out They don't wanna hear about it It's only inches on the reel-to-reel And the radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools Tryin' to anaesthetize the way that you feelAs I walk through this wicked world Searching for light in the darkness of insanity I ask myself, is all hope lost Is there only pain and hatred and misery And each time I feel like this inside There's one thing I wanna know What's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding Oh, what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding And as I walk on through troubled times My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes So where are the strong and who are the trusted And where is the harmony, sweet harmony 'Cause each time I feel it slipping away Just makes me wanna cry What's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding Oh, what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding History repeats the old conceits The glib replies, the same defeats Keep your finger on important issues With crocodile tears and a pocketful of tissues I'm just the oily slick On the wind-up world of the nervous tick In a very fashionable hovel I hang around, dying to be tortured You'll never be alone in the bone orchard This battle with the bottle is nothing so novel So in this almost-empty gin palace Through a two-way looking glass, you see your Alice You know she has no sins for all your jealousy In a sense, she still smiles very sweetly Charged with insults and flattery Her body moves with malice Do you have to be so cruel to be callous And now, you find you fit this identikit completely You say you have no secrets, then leave discreetly I might make it California's fault Be locked in Geneva's deepest vault Just like the canals of Mars and the Great Barrier Reef I come to you beyond beliefAlmost blue Almost doing things we used to do There's a girl here and she's almost you Almost All the things that your eyes once promised I see in hers too Now your eyes are red from crying Almost blue Flirting with this disaster became me It named me as the fool who only aimed to be Almost blue It's almost touching, it will almost do There is part of me that's always true Always Not all good things come to an end Now it is only a chosen few I've seen such an unhappy couple Almost me Almost you Almost blueCalling Mister Oswald with the swastika tattoo There is a vacancy waiting in the English voodoo Carving 'V' for vandal on the guilty boy's head When he's had enough of that, maybe you'll take him to bed To teach him he's alive 'fore he wishes he was dead Turn up the T V, no one listening will suspect Even your mother won't detect it So your father won't know They think that I've got no respect But everything means less than zero Hey, red Hey, red Oswald and his sister are doing it again They've got the finest home movies that you have ever seen They've got a thousand variations: every service with a smile They're going to take a little break, and they'll be back after a while Well, I hear that South America is coming into style Turn up the T V, no one listening will suspect Even your mother won't detect it So your father won't know They think that I've got no respect But everything means less than zero"

Faith No More,1970s punk rock musicians,10,"Can you feel it, see it, hear it today If you can't, then it doesn't matter anyway You will never understand it, 'cause it happens too fast And it feels so good, it's like walking on glass It's so cool, it's so hip, it's alright It's so groovy, it's outta sight You can touch it, smell it, taste it, so sweet But it makes no difference 'cause it knocks you off your feet You want it all, but you can't have it It's cryin', bleedin', lyin' on the floor So you lay down on it and you do it some more You've got to share it, so you dare it Then you bare it and you tear it You want it all, but you can't have it It's in your face, but you can't grab it It's alive, afraid, a lie, a sin It's magic, it's tragic, it's a loss, it's a win It's dark, it's moist, it's a bitter pain It's sad it happened, and it's a shameGo on and wring my neck Like when a rag gets wet A little discipline For my pet genius My head is like lettuce Go on, dig your thumbs in I cannot stop givin'I'm thirty-something Sense of security Like pockets jinglin'Suck ingenuity Down through the family tree You're perfect, yes, it's true But without me, you're only you Your menstruating heart It ain't bleedin' enough for two It's a midlife crisis It's a midlife crisisKnow it sounds funny, but I just can't stand the pain Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow Seems to me, girl, you know I've done all I can You see I begged, stole, and I borrowed, yeah Ooh, that's why I'm easy I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah That's why I'm easy I'm easy like Sunday morning I wanna be high, so high And I wanna be free to know the things I do are right I wanna be free, just me, oh, baby Oh, ooh, that's why I'm easy I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah That's why I'm easy, yeah I'm easy like Sunday morningIf you want to open the hole Just put your head down and go And step beside the piece of the circumstance You got to wash away the taste of evidence Wash it away Evidence, evidence Evidence, got a taste of evidence I didn't feel a thing You didn't mean a thing Look in the eye and testify Didn't feel a thing Anything you say, we know you're guilty Hands above your head and you won't even feel me You won't feel me I didn't feel a thing I didn't feel a thing You didn't mean a thing Look in the eye and testify Didn't feel a thing about disasters, fires, floods and killer bees about the N AS A shuttle falling in the sea about starvation and the food that Live Aid bought about disease, baby Rock, Hudson, rock, yeah!It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it about the gamblers and the pushers and the freaks about the smack and crack and whack that hits the streets about the welfare of all you boys and girls about you people cause

worked out better than we had planned Capital from boy, woman and man We were like ink and paper Numbers on a calculator Knew arithmetic so well Working overtime Completed what was assigned We had to multiply ourselves A bouncing little baby A shiny copper penny And he spent himself Would not listen to us But when he lost his appetite He lost his weight in friends He became a fat nickel so fast Then came puberty Exponentially Soon our boy became a millionI know the feeling, it is the real thing The essence of the truth The perfect moment, that golden moment I know you feel it too I know the feeling, it is the real thing You can't refuse the embrace, no!It's like the pattern below the skin You gotta reach out and pull it all in And you feel like you're too close But you swallow another dose The pinnacle of happiness A-fillin' up your soul You don't think you can take any more You never wanna let go To touch the roots of experience The most basic ingredients To see the unseen glitter of life And feel the dirt, grief, anger and strife Cherish the certainty of now It kills you a bit at a time Cradle the inspiration It will leave you writhin' on the floorBack and forth, I sway with the wind Resolution slips away again Right through my fingers, back into my heart Where it's out of reach and it's in the dark Sometimes I think I'm blind Or I may be just paralyzed Because the plot thickens every day And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumblin' away But I know, there's a picture beneath Indecision clouds my vision No one listens Because I'm somewhere in between My love and my agony You see, I'm somewhere in between My life is fallin' to pieces Somebody put me together Layin' face down on the ground My fingers in my ears to block the sound My eyes shut tight to avoid the sight Anticipatin' the end, losin' the will to fight Droplets of ""yes"" and ""no"" in an ocean of ""maybe""From the bottom, it looks like a steep incline From the top, another downhill slope of mine But I know, the equilibrium's thereI'll be your leprechaun Shamrock or lucky charm Tap-dancing all alone Dip into the sugar bowl Sunny Side up Sunny Side up Such a lovely way to start the day Sunny Side up Sunny Side up Not the only way to fry an egg Sunny Side up Sunny Side up I am just a grain of sand on your beach With all of my heart All of my Heart A drop of rain through  your hands Rainbows will bend for me Curvy Honey bees will sting for me Stingin', stingin'I started this It's all for me What's yours is mine and mine is mine, that's plain to see So give it up I've got to have I swallow, I swallow I swallow, I swallow Be aggressive B-E aggressive B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E Be aggressive B-E aggressive B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E What someone else Would leave behind and spit it out, let go to waste I claim is mine You're my flavor  of the week I swallow, I swallow I swallow, I swallow"

Fastbacks,1970s punk rock musicians,10,"And so I landed here on another planet By now it seems like it might have happened to me Everybody here looking at me weird So I wondered And so I wondered and wandered around the planet Looking for something that might have mattered to me Everything here looks to me to be All in order All in order it seems to be'Til cautiously I go Around the corner, where nothing will grow without a Kind of water that they don't know about The plants think the animals are ruining everything Everything here looks to me to be All in order All in order it seems to be'Til cautiously I goNow you think that you could be The something that I could see So why don't you just look at me And tell me that you're going free All I said that you would find Is what it is that's on your mind You will crack, and very soon Your guitar will slip out of tune Now you've found out at long last That things are going way too fast In my case, well, I guess that's tough'Cause things aren't going fast enough Chips are down, speaking, choking Die's too hot, the mold is broken What it is, what I said Was left better unspoken Speed is not at my command When you're knocked down, you will not stand My fortune's told, and it's been cast And you'll be left in the pastAfter all the troubles have come and gone They were here for so long Now I've got this sinking feeling Everyone seems to be leaving Oh-woah-oh And I can't believe how lonely it is here on K Street There's no one like me here on K Street How lonely it is here on K Street today, today, today I thought that all the problems had gone away I found out where I should be They were back the very next day And I don't know what to believe Oh-woah-oh And I can't believe how lonely it is here on K Street There's no one like me here on K Street How lonely it is here on K Street today, today, today Today, today, today, today TodaySomeday, when one guy in the world finally owns every coin And when I'm sure that he's not thinking of me When he says, ""Hi there, I really am your friend Sorry, I'm doing all I can for you And I really mean that""Nobody ever asked me what I wanted from them, and then Listened to me say, they only ask me again That's about the time I'll be going to the moon And then that's where I'll stay That's about the time I'll be going to the moon And then that's where I'll stay Far away from here Someday, when I can't take this place I'll take a trip out into space I think I mean it That's about the time I'll be going to the moon And then that's where I'll stay That's about the time I'll be going to the moon And then that's where I'll stay Far away from hereI've been lied to, led around and then cut down Been spit on and walked upon by you I've been run through slapped till sober Then driven over held at bay then thrown away by you But not anymore Never again Never again by you I need some help beside me Got to throw the past behind me Now more than yesterday The truth must come alive I feel more than half dead The gun lies there beside my bed You don't forget a thing I said to you I been sick all day Yesterday and everyday I'm sick of all that has to with youWalk around sometime and see if you can think up something That you've never thought before Judging by the looks of things, it's getting late And you've gone by that neighborhood before Prove it to yourself if you've got something to offer See if you can welcome yourself home anymore If you ever have, then it's not worth mentioning Believe me never Hate me forever Believe me never Hate me the rest of your life Believe me never Hate me forever Believe me never Hate me foreverThey don't really care for you They don't wanna know what you're going through They will never do anything for you They don't move an inch, they don't have to I'll try anything I can do I will walk as far as I have to Walk around the world if I have to prove This world isn't here for me and you They don't really care for you They don't wanna know what you're going through They will never do anything for you They don't move an inch, they don't have to I'll do anything I can Storm across their patriotic land Scraping flag decals off of custom vans Yellow ribbons 'round the garbage cans You'll find anything you want If you look for it long enough Everything you need, you'll have But you will look longI know that life gets so miserable It isn't fair, and it doesn't care Nothing goes the way you want it to Nothing new, and nothing else to do now And when you've had enough Ahh-ah-ahh You can call me up Ahh-ahh Have you had enough Ahh-ah-ahh You can call me up Ahh-ahh Precious life, so miserable Wasting time and being tired We're also tired of being tired of Wasting time, this precious time And when you've had enough

know if I'm all ready to leave Do you really want to be in America See, you don't really have to be in America Somewhere else might be better I'm not just talking about weather But I don't think that I'd be willing to get up and go You've got the answer Speak up if you know Maybe it's just that I know what it means to me To be living a life almost thinking free I can pretty well choose how I want to be Do you really want to be in America See, you don't really have to be in America Somewhere else might be better I'm not just talking about weather But I don't think that I'd be willing to get up and go You've got the answer Speak up if you knowThe day that did not exist I sat all alone That date did not exist In my mind the storm That beat the shore The day that did not exist I was never warned The date did not exist There was no one home There was nothing wrong There was nothing done The day that did not exist I was not alone The date did not exist I unplugged the phone And rode out the storm"

so far out of reachOh baby, don't it feel like heaven right now Don't it feel like something from a dream Yeah, I've never known nothing quite like this Don't it feel like tonight might never be again

there with a tattoo, too The future was wide open They moved into a place they both could afford He found a night club he could work at the door She had a guitar and she taught him some chords The sky was the limit Into the great wide open Under them skies of blue Out in the great wide open A rebel without a clue The papers said Ed always played from the heart He got an agent and a roadie named Bart They made a record and it went in the charts The sky was the limit His leather jacket had chains that would jingle They both met movie stars, partied and mingled Their A&R man said, ""I don't hear a single""The future was wide open One, two You better watch what you say You better watch what you do to me Don't get carried away Girl, if you can do better than me Go Yeah, go But remember

I don't take you all of the wayYou know sometimes, I don't know why But this old town just seems so hopeless I ain't really sure, but it seems I remember the good times Were just a little bit more in focus But when she puts her arms around me I can somehow rise above it Yeah, man, when I got that little girl standin' right by my side You know, I can tell the whole wide world to shove it, hey!Here comes my girl Here comes my girl Yeah, and she looks so right She is all I need tonight Every now and then I get down to the end of the day I have to stop and ask myself why I've done it It just seems so useless to have to work so hard And nothin' ever really seems to come from it And then she looks me in the eye and says, ""We're gonna last forever""And man, you know I can't begin to doubt it No, 'cause it just feels so good, and so free, and so right I know we ain't never gonna change our minds about it, hey Hey!Hey!Don't come around here no more Don't come around here no more Whatever you're

I know, I know But she's got a little pout and she's pretty So I won't let go No I won't get soaked No I won't get soakedI’ve been alone with my demons now Long enough to call them my friends I’ve swallowed every pair of scissors in this house To cut off my loose ends It still won’t be enough to reopen The parts of me I fear have been sealed for good The water under your bridge is overflowing I love harder than I should You need me until you don’t, I’m at the end of my rope You need me until you don’t, I’m at the end of my rope I am not your fool, no, not anymore I am not your fool, from now on I’ll keep one foot out the door This road I’ve been travеling on Has all along been thin ice In rose colored daydrеams, it seems I’ve wasted all my timeShe's got a hunch in her back and a fire in her eyes And she's crossing four lane traffic There's a life on the other side of this hopeless divide And nothing's gonna keep her from it, no She's tried playing it safe, but there's no time to waste Her heart is ripping right through its seams She's tried playing it safe, but there's no time to wait For that traffic light to turn green What's the point in wasting all your time Waiting on a lifeline On the other side of fear Who knows what you might find She's got a hunch in her back and a fire in her eyes And she's reading aloud a love letter To a woman, she knows, is impossible though She doesn't need to actually get her Wherever you go is where you are And the next crossroad is never far What if you gave in and just let it out Aren't you tired of waiting aroundAre we any closer to the truth I haven't seen any poetry in the streets Just the blood of the youth Boy, it's the land of the free Until you're 18 and shipped off to foreign lands Forced to fight for your country, oh Oh, we wanted to believe in Something bigger than ourselves Swore to make it all great again See how the dream melts And nothing really seems that great to me It kinda seems like we're all on fire And pitiful rivers won't douse the flames Oh, they just keep rising highеr A history book splattered With blood on evеry page So much for freedom When your interests have changedOne thing I know for sure Is that time, sweet time alone ain't a cure There's a sickness in my bones And it's calling out for you Hear it tap, tap, tapping on my skull Until the day it finally breaks through If there's a secret drug That would swallow you up Take it from my memory, bleach it from my mind I would pay a million dollars if only I could find some peace I keep it to myself Cause I can't think of anyone else You've got me wrapped in silly little knots I keep it to myself Cause I know it's bad for my health You are putting me through hell But hey, at least I keep it to myself You should've known from thе start All I wanted was to be ripped apart My patiеnce is wearing thin But my blood never runs dry Must I be on my back for us to see eye to eyeI crashed my car Knew from afar You'd hurt like hell Set me on fire With my desire You did it well With your attack I just looked back And with a glance I should've seen you coming, babe I didn't stand a chance Just with your eyes You robbed me blind Of all my woe And with your song You made me strong Don't let me go With mass destruction Your seduction Broke right through You aimed your pistol at my heart And shot your target trueHey!I’m terrified of love songs And irrevocable going-ons And I know that I don’t sing enough And I think I know I think too much Is there a step-by-step guide A quick how-to or side-by-side If only I could ever find a way To tell you all I need to say How proud she is all on her own How bad she is at being alone Before I completely lose my head Let’s fall and crawl our way to bed Put my heart out on my sleeve So I won’t ask you not to leave Hold and tell me not to fear The river floods this year And if the stars don’t evеr blink Then maybe I don’t have to thinkSweetheart, tell me why you stay And why you let him get his way When you know he’s got his eye On another man’s goodbye, Miss Yesterday Sweetheart, tell me how you live And what you’ve got that’s left to give Other than your fourth finger And the one that’s on the trigger, and can you forgive So young, oh god, what a waste To think you’re attached at the waist There’s so much more you’re allowed Than what you’ve already said out loud Amelia Girl of the millennia The modern woman doesn’t feel She’ll never die, she won’t quit And you know she’ll never kneel Amelia Girl of the millennia The viper that bites the heel Says, “Do or die  Make the deal Or reinvent the wheel”It's a magical view The sky's a little closer The earth spins slower The sun's a little lower Not too high So it doesn't blind me And with you beside me I think I'll take my time wondering why Cause it's a magical view I see things I never thought were true Yeah, it's a magical view When I see the world through you I awoke in a fantasy Shrouded in a canopy Of sparks divine and 3/4 time Of the newly mine and the left behind The old ways of day-to-day Are nothing more than hеarsay Pockets full of push and pull Intoxicants of cape and bull"

Lydia Lunch,1970s punk rock musicians,10,"In the cool of the evening When everything is getting kinda groovy I call you up and ask you If you'd like to go with me and see a movie First you say no, you've got some plans for the night Then you stop and say ""alright""Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you You always keep me guessing I never seem to know what you are thinking And if a girl looks at you It's for sure your little eye will be a-winking I get confused 'cause I don't know where I stand And then you smile and hold my hand Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you Spooky Maybe someday you'll decide to stop these games That you've been playing I'm gonna tell you all the things my heart's Been dying to be saying Just like a ghost you've been haunting my dreams So I proposed on Halloween Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you SpookyWe had a date12th street at eight If you're gonna be there, don't be late Instructed as such Without a soft touch If it would've mattered, it didn't too much I waited for you a minute or two Well, just what kind of a girl do you think I am Fumbing around a cigarette Smoked it to the ash and then lit up again Blowing smoke rings Blind the air If you're comin', baby, you're just two in a rears I'm too impatient, and you're just too late My attention span is just not that great Then this young kinda guy walked right on by me He couldn't have been more than sixteen There's just nothing I can do you gotta understand You see, he had this walk I mean, down pat and No he wasn't going my direction so I just kinda turned and I I had to, I was a woman possessed I mean, I wasn't myselfI am bongo crazed with the crazy beat Makes me stamp and shout Get up on my feet All the boys go wild with the bongo chill Chase the girls around for a bongo thrill Forget the beach Party with no stuff'Cause it's kind of fun But it's not enough Let the boys go wild and the boys don't miss When they grab the girls for a bongo kiss Surfing's not too cool Just what can you do Standing on a board and the water's smooth All the girls go wild, start to shake their seeds When the boys start to play their bongo beat I am bongo crazed with the crazy beat Makes me stamp and shout Get up on my feet All the boys go wild with the bongo chill Chase the girls around for a bongo thrill Forget the beach Party with no stuff'Cause it's kind of fun But it's not enough But the boys go wild and the boys don't miss When they chase the girls for a bongo kissFingers move fingers My wrists made of satin Don't be afraid of what's gonna happen Elbows to ankles my fists out of place I turn around backwards and off slides my face Bones plattered shattered Dissolving my skin My torso melts it flows out my shins Open so open a circular mark The cut on my forehead it glows in the dark Ran away dark dank stank moss creeps Cross the river I run from the dark stark fear For I'd run, I run from the night I say so sad, so dead and mad An angry diehard tears from mad My veins in pain They torch my mouth the saint Ran away dark dank stank moss it creeps Cross the river I run from the dark stark fear I run from the nightSunday is gloomy My hours are slumberless Dearest the shadows I live with are numberless Little white flowers Will never awaken you Not where the black coach Of sorrow has taken you Angels have no thoughts Of ever returning you Would they be angry If I thought of joining you Gloomy Sunday Gloomy is Sunday With shadows, I spend it all My heart and I Have decided to end it all Soon there'll be candles And prayers that are said I know But let them not weep Let them know that I'm glad to goBodies Bodies Touched by the toil and plunged into his arms Cursed through the night with eyes of alarm A melody black flowed out of my breath Searching for death, but bodies need rest Bodies Under the soil now waiting for worms All that I feared is all that I've learned All that I know is all that I think Dead feelings are cool, down lower I sink Bodies need rest, we all need our rest Sleep an easy sleep, rest, rest Bodies need their rest We all need our rest Sleep an easy sleep, rest, rest, rest, rest But come back in the morning Come back hard Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake upThey're coming for me now Nothing scares me anyhow I can't feel the heat Some kind of crazy scene I'm gonna let this one rip It's just another fucked up trip I'm gonna let this one rip It's just another fucked up trip Oh God how it bores me To see myself ?But I give   once again I'm gonna let this one rip You're on another fucked up trip I'm gonna let this one rip It's just another fucked up trip They're coming for me now Nothing scares me anyhow Nothing scares me anymore Just another manic whoreTake the wheel, of the world And drive, drive, drive, drive, drive Quick as a gun Blind like a ghost I catch most things in my blood You all lose between rooms One last gasp before I go Your crystal skin laced with rust Laced with rust, laced with rust Take the wheel of the world and drive One blood lust glance of the milky way Two shots, one in a million Short-circuits a billion light years away Down here it rains blood and milk for months The Zulus are getting too strong to play with no more No more, no more Take the wheel of the world and drive A pocket too full of the stars Too hot to handle alone Burning a hole, smoldering footsteps that lead to a heart Mine, yours, who cares, it still burns Still borne I'm still burning Burning down Take the wheel of the world and driveWe'll go for a walk and you'll get nowhere This road leads to every disaster Riding shotgun thru this silence Spitting out these vicious secrets There's a kill in a car and he's parking it right outside my face Get it done with, get it done with Is that a coffin fulluva cupids you keep pushing through my gate There's a lot of fallen angels getting crushed beneath his feet Now the killer gets the car and just drives it right into my guts Get it done with, get it done with Now the tears start flowing the fun really starts Goodbye heaven, here comes heartache Now the tears start flowing the fun really starts Goodbye heaven, here comes heartbreak Well the blood is really flowing and the fun it really starts I don't need no derelict bloodshed To lay these stains upon your altar Saying prayers for passion killers Who like saints commit these murdersBlood and guts in the movie house, slaughterhouse, slaughterhouse He rips through all the movie buffs, he rips them up, he rips them up He goes where don't wanna go and what he does, he doesn't know He's the saddest creature known to man An unknown Sam in an unkind land He's out of his head and it's out of his hands He's out of his head and it's out of his hands He's out of his head and it's out of his hands He's out of his head and it's out of his hands He's dead in the head He's dead in the head He's dead in the head He's dead in the head He does it up because he's come undone, he does the blood walk and he does the blood run Everything is going black, he's feeling weak with a mean streak Come to me, my little one, my heart is stone, my heart is cold He's out of

I'm pretty fly for a white guy Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis You know, it's kinda hard just to get along today Our subject isn't cool, but he fakes it anyway He may not have a clue and he may not have style But everything he lacks, well, he makes up in denial So don't debate, a player straight You know he really doesn't get it anyway Gotta play the field, and keep it real For you, no way, for you, no way So if you don't rate, just overcompensate At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake The world needs wannabes, ah Hey, hey, do that brand-new thing Show me how to lie, you're getting better all the time And turning all against the one is an art that's hard to teach Another clever word sets off an unsuspecting herd And as you step back into line, a mob jumps to their feet Now dance, fucker, dance, man, he never had a chance And no one even knew it was really only you And now you steal away, take him out today Nice work you did, you're gonna go far, kid With a thousand lies and a good disguise Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes When you walk away, nothing more to say See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives Slowly out of line, and drifting closer in your sight So play it out, I'm wide-awake, it's a scene about me There's something in your way and now someone is gonna pay And if you can't get what you want, well, it's all because of me Now dance, fucker, dance, man, I never had a chance And no one even knew, it was really only you And now you'll lead the way, show the light of day Nice work you did, you're gonna go far, kid, trust deceivedLa, la, la-la-la La, la, la-la-la I wrote her off for the tenth time today And practiced all the things I would say But she came over, I lost my nerve I took her back and made her dessert Oh, I know I'm being used That's okay, man, 'cause I like the abuse I know she's playing with me That's okay 'cause I've got no self-esteem Oh, way, oh yeah, yeah Oh yeah, yeah Oh yeah, yeah Oh yeah, yeah We make plans to go out at night I wait 'til two, then I turn out the light This rejection's got me so low If she keeps it up, I just might tell her soWhen we were young, the future was so bright The old neighborhood was so alive And every kid on the whole damn street Was gonna make it big and not be beat Now the neighborhood's cracked and torn The kids are grown up, but their lives are worn How can one little street swallow so many lives Chances thrown, nothing's free Longing for what used to be Still it's hard, hard to see Fragile lives, shattered dreams Jamie had a chance, well, she really did Instead, she dropped out and had a couple of kids Mark still lives at home 'cause he's got no job He just plays guitar, smokes a lot of pot And Jay committed suicide And Brandon O D'd and died What the hell is goin' on The cruelest dream, realityMy friend's got a girlfriend, man, he hates that bitch He tells me every day He says, ""Man, I really gotta lose my chick In the worst kinda way.""She sits on her ass, he works his hands to the bone To give her money every payday But she wants more dinero just to stay at home Well, my friend, you gotta say""I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way Na-na, why don't you get a job ""Say, ""No way,"" say, ""No way-ya, no way Na-na, why don't you get a job ""I guess all his money, well, it isn't enough To keep her bill collectors at bay I guess all his money, well, it isn't enough’Cause that girl's got expensive taste""I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way Na-na, why don't you get a job ""Say, ""No way,"" say, ""No way-ya, no way Na-na, why don't you get a job ""Hey, man, you know I'm really okay The gun in my hand will tell you the same But when I'm in my car, don't give me no crap’Cause the slightest thing and I just might snap When I go driving, I stay in my lane But getting cut off, it makes me insane I open the glove box, reach inside I'm gonna wreck this fucker's ride I guess I got a bad habit Of blowin' away I got a bad habit And it ain't goin' away Yeah Yeah, oh They say the road's a dangerous place If you flip me off, I'll get in your face If you drive on my ass, your foot's on the gas And your next breath is your lastYou gotta keep 'em separated Like the latest fashion Like a spreading disease The kids are strappin' on their way to the classroom Gettin' weapons with the greatest of ease The gangs stake out their own campus locale And if they catch you slippin', then it's all over, pal If one guy's colors and the other's don't mix They're gonna bash it up, bash it up, bash it up, bash it up...Hey  Man, you talkin' back to me Take him out You gotta keep 'em separated Hey  Man, you disrespectin' me Take him out You gotta keep 'em separated Hey, they don't pay no mind If you're under 18, you won't be doing any time Hey  Come out and play By the time you hear the siren It's already too late One goes to the morgue and the other to jail One guy's wasted and the other's a waste It goes down the same as the thousand before No one's getting smarter No one's learning the score Your never-ending spree of death and violence and hate Is gonna tie your own rope, tie your own rope, tie your own.. Maybe in another life I could find you there Pulled away before your time I can't deal, it's so unfair And it feels, and it feels like Heaven is so far away And it feels, yeah, it feels like The world has grown cold Now that you've gone away Leavin' flowers on your grave To show that I still care Black roses and ""Hail Mary's""Can't bring back what's taken from me I reach to the sky and call out your name And if I could trade, I would And it feels, and it feels like Heaven is so far away And it stings, yeah, it stings, now The world is so cold Now that you've gone awayIf you could only read my mind You would know that things between us ain't right I know your arms are open wide But you're a little on the straight side, I can't lie Your one vice Is you're too nice Come around now, can't you see I want you all tattooed I want you bad Complete me, mistreat me I want you to be bad, bad, bad, bad, bad If you could only read my mind You would know that I've been waiting so long For someone almost just like you But with attitude, I'm waiting, so come on Get out of Clothestime Grow out those highlights Come around now, can't you see The winds of fortune don't blow the same She had to get out and make a change She had a kid now, but much too young That baby daddy's out having fun He's sayin', ""I'm on a roll with all the girls I know""His baby momma, she ain't so slow He's sayin', ""I'm on a roll with all the girls I know""I know you wanna hit that, I know you wanna hit that, hit that All the world is gettin' with, I say Consequences are a lot, but hey That's the way it That's the way things go, ay, ay, ay What was a family, is now a shell We're raising kids now who raise themselves Sex is a weapon, it's like a drug It gets him right into that grave that he just dug She's saying, ""I'm on the run, I'm chasing guys for fun""Her baby daddy, it ain't his only one She's sayin', ""I'm on the run, I'm chasing guys for fun""I know you wanna hit that, I know you wanna hit that, hit that"

All the comforts of home have been denied People find it hard to understand I never cried before One thing's for certain There's nothing around that Could make me cry no more Baby, sometimes I think of you Out there in the night All the comforts of home have been denied Compared to all of them You stand out You gave me pure unspoiled love They're all reaching and grabbing But all you did was give me Love and love and love and love"

Patti Smith,1970s punk rock musicians,10,"Take me now, baby, here as I am Pull me close, try and understand Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe Love is a banquet on which we feed Come on now try and understand The way I feel when I'm in your hands Take my hand come undercover They can't hurt you now Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now Because the night belongs to lovers Because the night belongs to lust Because the night belongs to lovers Because the night belongs to us Have I doubt when I'm alone Love is a ring, the telephone Love is an angel disguised as lust Here in our bed until the morning comes Come on now try and understand The way I feel under your command Take my hand as the sun descends They can't touch you now Can't touch you now, can't touch you nowJesus died for somebody's sins but not mine Melting in a pot of thieves, wild card up my sleeve Thick, heart of stone, my sins, my own They belong to me Me People said beware, but I don't care Their words are just rules and regulations to me Me I walk in a room, you know I look so proud I move in this here atmosphere where anything's allowed Then I go to this here party and I just get bored Until I look out the window, see a sweet young thing Humping on a parking meter, leaning on the parking meter Oh, she looks so good Oh, she looks so fine And I've got this crazy feeling that I'm going to, ah-ah, make her mine Oh, I'll put my spell on her, here she comes Walking down the street, here she comes Coming through my door, here she comes Crawling up my stair, here she comes Waltzing through the hall in a pretty red dress And oh, she looks so good Oh, she looks so fine And I've got this crazy feeling that I'm going to, ah-ah, make her mineThe boy was in the hallway drinking a glass of tea From the other end of the hallway a rhythm was generating Another boy was sliding up the hallway He merged perfectly with the hallway He merged perfectly, the mirror in the hallway The boy looked at Johnny, Johnny wanted to run But the movie kept moving as planned The boy took Johnny , he pushed him against the locker He drove it in, he drove it home, he drove it deep in Johnny The boy disappeared, Johnny fell on his knees Started crashing his head against the locker Started crashing his head against the locker Started laughing hysterically When suddenly Johnny gets the feeling he's being surrounded by Horses, horses, horses, horses Coming in in all directions White shining silver studs with their nose in flames He saw horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horsesHis father died and left him a little farm in New England All the long black funeral cars left the scene And the boy was just standing there alone Looking at the shiny red tractor Him and his daddy used to sit inside And circle the blue fields and grease the night It was as if someone had spread butter On all the fine points of the stars'Cause when he looked up they started to slip Then he put his head in the crux of his arms And he started to drift, drift to the belly of a ship Let the ship slide open, and he went inside of it And saw his daddy behind the control board Streaming beads of light He saw his daddy behind the control board And he was very different tonight'Cause he was not human He was not human The little boy's face lit up with such naked joy That the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns White lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearly And he looked around and there was no black ship in sight No black funeral cars, nothing except for him the raven And fell on his knees and looked up and cried out""No, daddy, don't leave me here alone Take me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship Let the ship slide open and I'll go inside of it Where you are not human You are not human""She is benediction She is addicted to thee She is the root connection She is connecting with he Here I go and I don't know why I fell so ceaselessly Could it be he's taking over me I'm dancing barefoot Heading for a spin Some strange music draws me in Makes me come on like some heroine She is sublimation She is the essence of thee She is concentrating on He, who is chosen by she Here I go and I don't know why I spin so ceaselessly Could it be he's taking over me Baby was a black sheep baby was a whore Baby got big and baby get bigger Baby get something baby get more Baby baby baby was a rock n roll nigg​er Oh look around you all around you Riding on a copper wave Do you like the world around you Are you ready to behave Outside of society

trigger Baby baby baby is a rock n roll nigg​er Outside of society that's where I want to be Outside of society they're waitin for me Those who have suffered understand suffering And thereby extend their hand The storm that brings harm Also makes fertile blessed is the grass And herb and the true thorn and lightLate afternoon, dreaming hotel We just had the quarrel that sent you away I was looking for you Are you gone, gone Called you on the phone, another dimension Well you never returned, oh, you know what I mean I went looking for you Are you gone, gone Down by the ocean it was so dismal Women all standing with shock on their faces Sad description, oh, I was looking for you Everyone was singing, girl is washed up On Redondo Beach and everyone is so sad I was looking for you Are you gone, gone Pretty little girl everyone cried She was the victim of sweet suicide I went looking for you Are you gone, gone Every night before I go to sleep Find a ticket, win a lottery Scoop the pearls up from the sea Cash them in and buy you all the things you need Every night before I rest my head See those dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed I know they're stolen, but I don't feel bad I take that money, buy you things you never had Oh, baby, it would mean so much to me Oh, baby, to buy you all the things you need for free I'll buy you a jet plane, babe Get you on a higher plane to a jet stream And take you through the stratosphere And check out the planets there and then take you down Deep where it's hot, hot in Arabia, baby Then cool, cold fields of snow And we'll roll, dream, roll, dream, roll, roll, dream, dream When we dream it When we dream it When we dream it We'll dream it, dream it for free, free money Free money, free money Free money, free money Free money, free moneyPissing in a river watching it rise Tattoo fingers shy away from me Voices voices mesmerize Voices voices beckoning sea Come, come, come, come back Come back, come back, come back, come back Spoke of a wheel, tip of a spoon Mouth of a cave, I'm slave I'm free When are you coming hope you come soon Fingers fingers encircling thee Come, come, come, come come Come, come, come, come, come, come, come for me My bowels are empty excreting your soul What more can I give you baby I don't know What more can I give you to make this thing grow Don't turn your back now I'm talking to youThe wall is high, the black barn The babe in my arms in her swaddling clothes And I know soon that the sky will split And the planets will shift Balls of jade will drop And existence will stop Little sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind Little sister, the fates are calling on you Ah, here I stand again in this old 'lectric whirlwind The sea rushes up my knees like flame And I feel like just some misplaced Joan Of Arc And the cause is you lookin' up at me Oh baby, I remember when you were born It was dawn and the storm settled in my belly And I rolled in the grass and I spit out the gas And I lit a match and the void went flash And the sky split And the planets hit Balls of jade dropped And existence stopped, stopped, stop, stop"

this girl's an open page Bookmarking, she's so close now This girl is half his age Don't stand, don't stand so Don't stand so close to me Don't stand, don't stand so Don't stand so close to me Her friends are so jealous You know how bad girls get Sometimes it's not so easy to be the teacher's pet Temptation, frustration so bad it makes him cry Wet bus stop, she's waiting his car is warm and dry Don't stand, don't stand so Don't stand so close to me Don't stand, don't stand so Don't stand so close to meThough I've tried before to tell her Of the feelings I have for her in my heart Every time that I come near her I just lose my nerve, as I've done from the start Every little thing she does is magic Everything she does just turns me on Even though my life before was tragic Now I know my love for her goes on Do I have to tell the story Of a thousand rainy days since we first met It's a big enough umbrella But it's always me that ends up getting wet Every little thing she does is magic Everything she does just turns me on Even though my life before was tragic Now I know my love for her goes on I resolved to call her up A thousand times a day And ask her if she'll marry me In some old-fashioned way But my silent fears have gripped me Long before I reach the phone Long before my tongue has tripped me Must I always be alone Oh, oh, oh Another suburban family morning Grandmother screaming at the wall We have to shout above The din of our Rice Krispies We can't hear anything at all Mother chants her litany Of boredom and frustration But we know all her suicides are fake Daddy only stares into the distance There's only so much more that he can take Many miles away Something crawls from the slime At the bottom of a dark Scottish lake Another industrial ugly morning The factory belches filth into the sky He walks unhindered Through the picket lines today He doesn't think to wonder whyYou consider me the young apprentice Caught between the Scylla and Charybdis Hypnotized by you if I should linger Staring at the ring around your finger I have only come here seeking knowledge Things they would not teach me of in college I can see the destiny you sold Turn into a shining band of gold I'll be wrapped around your finger I'll be wrapped around your finger Mephistopheles is not your name I know what you're up to just the same I will listen hard to your tuition You will see it come to its fruition I'll be wrapped around your finger I'll be wrapped around your finger Devil and the deep blue sea behind me Vanish in the air, you'll never find me I will turn your face to alabaster When you find your servant is your masterEvery breath you take And every move you make Every bond you break Every step you take I'll be watching you Every single day And every word you say Every game you play Every night you stay I'll be watching you Oh, can't you see You belong to me How my poor heart aches With every step you take Every move you make And every vow you break Every smile you fake Every claim you stake I'll be watching youRoxanne You don't have to put on the red light Those days are over You don't have to sell your body to the night Roxanne You don't have to wear that dress tonight Walk the streets for money You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right Roxanne You don't have to put on the red light Roxanne You don't have to put on the red light Put on the red light Put on the red light Put on the red light Put on the red light Put on the red light, oh I loved you since I knew you I wouldn't talk down to ya I have to tell you just how I feel I won't share you with another boy I know my mind is made up So put away your makeup Told you once I won't tell you again It's a bad wayJust a castaway, an island lost at sea, oh Another lonely

Rattled by the Glimmerman, the Bogey-man, the Holy man And living in the shadows, in the shadows of a gunman Rattled like the coppers in your greasy till Rattled until time stood still Look across your shoulder and the school bell rings Another day of made-to-measure history Well I don’t mind if your heroes all have wings But your terrible beauty is torn Faithful departed We fickle hearted As you are now so once were we Faithful departed We the meek hearted With graces imparted Bring flowers to thee The girls from the kips proclaim their love for you When you stumbled in they knew you had a shilling or two But they cursed you on Sundays And Holy days of abstinence When you all stayed away And when you slept there A naked light bulb blinded your shame Your shadow on the wall took all the blame And the Sacred Hearts picture, compassion in His eyes Drowned out the river’s sighs Ah, let the grass grow green over the brewery tonight It’ll never come between the darkness and the light And there’s nothing too sick that it can’t be eased By the Devil’s holy water and a rosary beadsThere it goes!My phone is always ringing Why is there no one on the line I’ll sit and watch a movie on channel two I’ll think about it in the morning Sometimes I’m so narrow minded My vision's blinded by the cause Before the night is over I’ll slip into a second phase of wisdom Who are the strangers peeping inside Haunting, undaunted, their presence denied Why are thе strangers gathered in three Bеckoning fingers are calling for me You come on like a backseat driver But who’s taking who for a ride Can you help me walk on water Poetry in motion Do things I shouldn’t oughta I see shadows on my mirror I can’t see their point of view It’s confidential I’m just a fool It’s not essential To break the rules But you don’t know what my heart feels It’s not a toy Oh throw the dice decide my destiny I’m outrageous, you’re out to lunch You’re just worried about my hunch It’s confidential I’m just a fool It’s not essential To break the rules I am lonely but I don’t mind I’m not alone I guess it’s just my day to day routine"

Elle est partie tête baissée, a filé à l'Anglaise M'a laissé tomber, m'a trompé avec un frère Elle que je croyais fidèle, solide comme de la roche Mais c'est moche quand Demoiselle prend la fuite avec un proche C'est clair, Madame Sincérité n'était pas invitée Elle n'a semé que mensonges, et dévasté notre amitié Tes pensées me hantent, mon esprit est troublé Des réponses inquiétantes car mon propre ami cherche à me doubler Concilié   ""Walloo"" lui a dit Madame Humilité Qui a commencé par les yeux doux, et a finit par lui faire du pied Elle l'a prit par la main, lui a écarté la raison Et l'air de rien, a remplacé sa tête par un melon Devant les gens et médias notre amitié une parodie Les vrais tracas, devenus solidarité de pacotille T'sais, j'ai passé l'âge des caprices, oui, j'en n'ai plus rien à cirer Saches que je n'ai pas tourné la page khey, je l'ai déchiré On n'a plus rien à se dire, y'a plus de bonjour, au revoir On se dénigre sans même l'ombre d'un regard Oui ta fierté t'as perdu, ton ego t'as grugé Tu ne veux plus écouter les autres, tu veux juste les juger Oui j'ai passé l'âge des caprices, saches que j'en n'ai plus rien à cirer Non je n'ai pas tourné la page khey, je l'ai déchiré On s'est juré fidélité jusqu'à ce que la mort nous sépare Si ça ne va pas on s'en parle, on fait le point et on repart La vérité c'est que le temps sépare plus qu'il ne répare Faut

ce texte Je teste les contraintes de côté, je me suis assez rendu malade A force d'intérioriser pour esquiver les engueulades J'ai eu ma part de lâcheté, par peur de crever l'abcès D'affronter l'amour et l'amitié sous tous leurs aspects J'ai masqué mon mal être, j'ai tout laissé partir en couille En essayant de laisser paraître qu'entre nous, tout était cool Mais ça finit par se voir, ça finit par se sentirÇa finit par se savoir, faut qu'on cesse de se mentir On se fait du mal en s'aimant , j'ai mal en écrivant ces mots L'histoire était si belle, la fin est si moche Si différents mais si proches, les sentiments réciproques On ne sait plus comment s'y prendre, ça pique mais faut qu'on s'y frotte A mes ex-potes, à mes ex-meufs, mes futurs ennemis Je vous souhaite le meilleur, même si j'ai le seum, je vous remercie Prends pas ça pour de l'ironie, je suis sérieux, je suis revenu Je m'en suis remis, je me sens même mieux, beaucoup mieux, je remercie Dieu Difficile de pardonner, plus

is right Close your eyes and then it's past;Story of my life And I went down my old neighborhood The faces have all changed there's no one left to talk to And the pool hall I loved as a kid Is now a

searched To find the perfect life A brand new car and a brand new suit I even got me a little wife But wherever I have gone I was sure to find myself there You can run all your life But not go anywhereLove is a burning thing And it makes a fiery ring Bound by one desire I fell into a, a ring of fire I fell into a burnin' ring of fire I went down down down And the flames went higher And it burn burn burns That ring of fire That ring of fire The taste of love is sweet When hearts like ours meet I fell for ya, like a child Oh, let the fire burn wild I fell into a burnin' ring of fire I went down down down And the flames went higher And it burns burn burns That ring of fire That ring of fire Let it burn Well, I'm a gangster in 1934 Junkies, winos, pimps, and whores And all you men, women and kids best get out of the way I just left your town, took all your loot Wore a pink carnation and a pinstripe suit A hopped-up V8 Ford and some two-tone shoes And I'm already gone I left a pool of blood and sorrow I've got the machine gun blues I'll be out of here before the break of dawn I'll hit the highway, smoke a big cigar Gonna stop and bury the cash, then get some more There's only one thing on my mind That's makin' across that old state line Without a hail of avenging bullets waiting there for me And I'm already gone I left a path of pure destruction I've got the machine gun blues Already gone My life will soon be through I've got the machine gun bluesWhen I was young I was invincible I find myself now thinking twice I never thought about no future Its just the roll of the dice But the day may come when you've got something to lose And just when you think you're done paying dues And you say to yourself, dear God what have I done And hope it's not too late cause tomorrow may never come Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come Yesterday is history and tomorrow's a mystery But baby right now, it's just about you and me You can run you can hide, just like Bonnie and Clyde Reach for the sky ain't never gonna die And I thank the Lord for the love I have found And hold you tight cause tomorrow may never

Swell Maps,1970s punk rock musicians,10,"I don't wanna go because I know And all of those toys that crawl, they just reach for doors I don't wanna go because I know And I've seen you, you're crying above the ship You just stuck out hiding from the trees You just lost your fame inside the shop I don't wanna go because I know Oh  I can't see the pictures that you lost I don't wanna go because I know The only way out is to wait for it again You just stuck out hiding from the trees You just lost your fame inside the shop I don't wanna go because I know And I just bought a ship it's made of brass I don't wanna go because I know You're falling from the target like a toy You just stuck out hiding from the trees You just lost your fame inside the shop I don't wanna go because I know And I don't wanna ever see your face again, no more Oh  I don't wanna go because I know You pick it up and keep it like a toyNo more pushing, let's go and build a car We're ready for the fly-past, another slow film Waiting for a minor change, at last the scenery Always saving up to listen to some fiction Try to buy a castle But there's no windows left I don't mind a breakout But there's never enough time Whatever you are saving for At least know what you're waiting for Don't try pushing We'd rather buy a car Just waiting for the pictures in some line It's an easy catch in a courtyard When you're trying too hard Always waiting up in case the patterns break Try to catch that look That the others left I don't mind a breakout But there's never enough timeRead about Seymour yesterday In the news that found it’s way To where I sleep and seek to be Where I am, I hear, I see Read about Seymour in my mind Window stacks across the blinds The lightning tower on Pyre Hill I wonder where I’ll find my fill Don’t look out!Don’t look out!Don’t look out!Don’t look out!Read about Seymour, look my way Feel him near day after day All cutlass and alone, alas The spirit sank like mourning glass Read about Seymour yesterday In the news that found it’s way To where I sleep and seek to be Where I am, I hate to see Don’t look out!Don’t look out!Don’t look out!Don’t look out Say, that's a swell map Are you intent on making it Maybe even faking it Then you'll see the real me Then you'll see what we can do Maybe someday we'll get it down And make the talking linger on Hoping it'll lead us there Then you'll see what we can do Do you believe in art Do you believe in art Do you believe in art If you can see right through the chance And never take the fun away Hoping it will lead us there Then you'll

cherokees Cake shop girl, oh cake shop girl I'd fall on bended knees I should like to buy a wedding cake for you and me Confectioners don't eat a thing That's made inside their shops Bottles of

were shattered and you lost your name Cutting lines you shot the channel Pushing out the galleons In a midget submarine Midget submarine So much like escape Sleeping in a moving train With ammunition

too late To put things right She said something about Wanting to jump and shout She gets a real charge From the radio Why's our little one taking so long In the bath tonight It might just have been something to do With turning off the light I always understood That we knew where we stood You get no leeway You get no time to change your waysGot a Rolls Royce It's driving me wild I never thought about it Got a space Between my eyes And I never knew about it No more ways To excavate you There's no two ways about it I think that's all There is to say Nothing more, oh, oh no Go away and play Little boys today, go HoorayI wanna spend some time with you Not now, but just another day It's much more fun just playing games With someone else's face No one waiting for my show It's still the second game No commitment, token drifting Round and round, still E-T-C I wanna live my life with you Not really, just sounds good A word to say to pass the time'Til all the trains have gone Just to spend some time with you Not now, but just another day No more waiting, you can't control it But everything is really great This is just another song I guess, it's rather long This is just another song And now it's gonna stopI got a full moon I got a full moon I got a full moon in my tail light I got a full moon in my port sight I got a full moon in my port sight I got a full moon in my tail

fire, ah!All wet, here, you might need a raincoat Shake-down, dreams walking in broad daylight Three hundred sixty-five degrees Burning down the house It was once upon a place, sometimes I listen to myself Gonna come in first place People on their way to work say, “Baby, what did you expect ”Gonna burst into flame, ahTake a look at these hands Take a look at these hands The hand speaks The hand

highway A place where nobody knows The sound of gunfire off in the distance I'm getting used to it now Lived in a brownstone, lived in the ghetto I've lived all over this town This ain't no party, this ain't no disco This ain't no fooling around No time for dancing, or lovey-dovey I ain't got time for that now Transmit the message, to the receiver Hope for an answer some day I got three passports, a couple of visas You don't even know my real name High on a hillside, the trucks are loading Everything's ready to roll I sleep in the daytime and I work in the nighttime I might not ever get homeLost my shape, trying to act casual Can't stop, I might end up in the hospital Changing my shape, I feel like an accident They're back to explain their experience Isn't it weird  Looks too obscure to me Wasting away, that was their policy I'm ready to leave, I push the facts in front of me Facts lost, facts are never what they seem to be Nothing there, no information left of any kind

slowly But doesn't last very long I, I, I, I, no need to worry Everything's under control O-U-T, but no hard feelings What do you know  Take you away We're being taken for a ride again I got a girlfriend that's better than that She has the smoke in her eyes She's coming up, going right through my heart She's gonna give me surprise I think it's right, better than this I think you can if you like I got a girlfriend with bows in her hair And nothing is better than that What about the time you were rollin' over Fall on your face, you must be having fun Walk lightly, think of a time You'd best believe this thing is real Put away that gun, this part is simple Try to recognize what is in your mind God help us, help us to surmise These slippery people help us understand What's the matter with him  I see his face Don't play no games Look from the bottom to the top Turn like a wheel See for yourself We're gonna move Turn like a wheel inside a wheel I remember when sittin' in the tub Pulled out the plug, the water was runnin' out Cool down, stop actin' crazy They're gonna leave and we'll be on our own Seven times five, they were living creatures Watch 'em come to life right before your eyes Backsliding, how do you do These slippery people gonna see you throughSometimes the world has a load of questions Seems like the world knows nothing at all The world is near, but it's out of reach Some people touch it, but they can't hold on She is moving to describe the world She has messages for everyone She is moving by remote control Hands that guide her are invisible The world has a way of looking at people Sometimes we feel that the world is wrong She loves the world and all the people in it She shakes 'em up when she start to walk"
Tubeway Army,1970s punk rock musicians,10,"It's cold outside And the paint's peeling off of my walls There's a man outside In a long coat, grey hat, smoking a cigarette Now the light fades out And I wonder what I'm doing in a room like this There's a knock on the door And just for a second I thought I remembered you So now I'm alone Now I can think for myself About little deals and S.U's And things that I just don't understand Like a white lie at night Or a sly touch at times I don't think it meant anything to you So I open the door It's the 'friend' that I'd left in the hallway""Please sit down.""A candlelit shadow on a wall near the bedDown in the park where the machmen Meet the machines and play Kill by Numbers Down in the park with a friend called Five I was in a car crash or was it the war But I've never been quite the same Little white lies like I was there Come to Zom-Zom's, a place to eat Like it was built in one day You can watch the humans trying to run Oh look, there's a rape machine I'd go outside if it'd look the other way You wouldn't believe the things they do Down in the park Where the chant is death, death, death Until sun cries morning Down in the park with friends of mine We are not lovers, we are not romantics We are here to serve you A different face but the words never changeStroll to the cafe My God how time flies I close up my brain And another friend dies I feel like a mirror Feel like nothing is mine I could go back to crying But now dying seems fine So I hang from the ceiling Or I sit on the air Or rot in a corner Until somebody cares Faces at random I quote people I knew I'd love to be like me If I can feel like you Here am I: more roche five than pain Here am I: just me and my walls to blame Here am I, I really don't feel quite sane Here am I: still searching for my shadow in vain Lock my door I only think in black and white I'll even try to look ashamedThe alarm rang for days You could tell from conversations I was waiting by the screen I couldn't recognise my photograph Me, I disconnect from you I was walking up the stairs Something moved in silence I could feel his mind decaying Only inches away from me And I disconnect from you Please don't turn me off I don't know what I'm doing outside Me and the telephone that never rings If you were me, what would you do Me, I disconnect from youIt was hard to avoid I suppose it was the shame But they didn't even try You see we'd never met And they didn't have names There was nothing I could do So I turned on the crowd And I screamed, ""You and you""""It could have been you""And they seemed to think That I looked that way Or maybe I was wrong So I said""Do you know Mr  Wall ""And they looked the other way And then they smiled at me But the police came And I said it was me And I just walked awayMmmmmmm ahhhhhhh Don't be a dummy Move like honey Don't be a dummy Use your money Come out proud, don't hide in the crowd Find the gear of love to grind Find the gear to suit you Mine'll suit ya!Lee Cooper!Lee Cooper I saw him turn on like a machine in the park Saying, ""Please come with me"", but you've been there before I saw him whir away into the night Like a nightmare on wheels saying, ""Never again""I'd give it all up for you I'd even be a number just for you The strangest living boy you could ever wish to see""That's me""Yellowed newspapers tell the story of someone""Do you know this man "", tomorrow the cure Only police ever see night time for real Turn on the light and cry, ""No more, no more""I was standing outside your door Waiting for the grey men to go When my mind turned on me with a vengeance I had never known My own Everyone heard the voice on the radio Saying, ""Why move around and waste my time ""There are no independents anymore The tape is a circle but who really cares I saw you behind the wall I even heard you laugh at me You disgust me tonight with your answer to something new That's youSlowly the thought, ""There is no one to replace""Came into view and he began to cry Now only boys that love only boys The perfect picture of a boy/girl age I'm praying to the aliens I'm praying to the aliens Grey overcoat and he could be anyone A random poll check, ""Do you ever think of women ""They broke him down into a torn old queen Living somewhere between dead and dying Well, I'm praying to the aliens I'm praying to the aliens There are no more, do you begin to see The corner of my eye could give me away Isn't it strange how times change I can't imagine living any other way I'm praying to the aliens I'm praying to the aliens I'm praying to the aliens I'm praying to the aliensWe are so fragile Advertising lies that are whiter than yours We are so fragile They could give us a war just to keep us amused We are so fragile I could stay here inside and say it's all been done We are so fragile Just pretend I never tried, I'll leave it up to you We are still so young And it must be wrong but I'd do it all the same We are really so shy There's nothing I can do except believe in you We could always go home But everyone says this is the place to be We are so unnatural But you wouldn't understand, you only deal with menFade to scenes of violence like a T V screen but silent Where the victims are all paid by the hour Staring at the ceiling as she gyrates all around me I am trying to forget she's done this all before Far too many people for a quiet night with myself Oh, I could be anyone tonight Focus on a feeling I've detected while I'm sleeping Sing a chorus of ""On Broadway"" and deny it all You are in my vision I can't turn my face You are in my vision I can't move my eyes You are in my vision I can't move at all You are in my vision Delicate bodies that decay beneath their clothing Play cards in an empty house in Paris The wreckage of a hero lies broken in a corner And everyone pretends they like to live that way You are in my vision I can't turn my face You are in my vision I can't move my eyes You are in my vision I can't move at all You are in my vision"

amazing the neighbours Gay, wild and willing, stripped of graceMy sex Waits for me Like a mongrel waits Downwind on a tight rope leash My sex Is a fragile acrobat Sometimes I'm a novocaine shot Sometimes I'm an Automat My sex Is often solo Sometimes it short circuits then Sometimes it's a golden glow My sex Is invested in Suburban photographs Skyscraper shadows on a car crash overpass My sex Is savage, tender It wears no future faces Owns just random gender My sex Has a wanting wardrobe I still explore Of all the bodies I knew And those I want to knowSomehow we drifted off too far Communicate like distant stars Splintered voices down the phone The sunlit dust, the smell of roses drifts, oh no Someone waits behind the door Hiroshima, mon amour Riding inter-city trains Dressed in European grey Riding out to echo beach A million memories in the trees and sands, oh no How can I ever let them go Hiroshima, mon amour Meet beneath the autumn lake Where only echoes penetrate Walk through Polaroids of the past Features fused like shattered glass, the sun's so low Turns our silhouettes to gold Hiroshima, mon amourAnd just as my eyes start seeing After all the pain The twist in my life starts healing Just to twist again In stillness, in sorrow Returns that softly sighing lament Lament And just as the smile's returning After all the pain The fire inside stops burning Just to burn again In moments of madness Returns that softly sighing lament LamentIn a quiet street washed by the rain the room within the home A lonely man sits cheek to cheek with unique designs in chrome The mellow years have long gone by, but now he sits alone He has a brand new radio, but never turns it on New Europeans Young Europeans New Europeans A photograph of lovers lost lies pressed in magazines Her eyes belong to a thousand girls, she's the wife who's never seen Their educated son has left in search of borrowed dreams His television's in his bed, he's frozen to the screen New Europeans Young Europeans New Europeans On a crowded beach washed by the sun he puts his headphones on His modern world revolves around the synthesizer's song Full of future thoughts and thrills, his senses slip away He's a European legacy, a culture for todayNative these words seem to me All speech directed to me I've heard them once before I know that feeling Stranger emotions in mind Changing the contours I find I've seen them once before Someone cries to me Chorus:O o o o The look and the sound of the voice O o o o They try, they try O o o o The shape and the power of the voice O o o o In strong low tones Forceful and twisting again Wasting the perfect remains I've felt it once before Slipping over me Sweetly the voices decay Draw on the lines that they say I'd lost it once before Now it cries to me"

Richard Hell and the Voidoids,1970s punk rock musicians,10,"I was saying ""let me out of here"" before I was even born It's such a gamble when you get a face It's fascinating to observe what the mirror does, but When I dine, it's for the wall that I set a place I belong to the Blank Generation, and I can take it or leave it each time, well I belong to the ..  generation, but I can take it or leave it each time Triangles were falling out the window as the doctor cursed He was a cartoon, long forsaken by the public eye The nurse adjusted her garters as I breathed my first The doctor grabbed my throat and yelled, ""God's consolation prize!""I belong to the Blank Generation, and I can take it or leave it each time, well I belong to the ..  generation, but I can take it or leave it each time, take it Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, oohTime and time again, I knew what I was doing And time and time again, I just made things worse It seems you see the most of what is really true When you're stepping into your hearse Only time can write a song that's really, really real The most a man can do is say the way its playing feels And know he only knows as much as time to him reveals And when I wanna write a song that says it all at once Like time sublimely silences the whys I know that if I try, I'm gonna take a fall at once And splatter there between my lies Only time can write a song that's really, really real The most a man can do is say the way its playing feels And know he only knows as much as time to him reveals We are made of it, and if we give submission Among our chances there's a chance we can choose And if we take it by uncertainty's permission, then Then it's impossible to loseI was a child Who wanted love that was wild Though tight as slow motion But crazed with devotion Insane with devotion A whole other notion I was fourteen and a half And it wasn't no laugh Love comes in spurts - oh no it hurts Love comes in spurts - it hurts Love comes in spurts - oh no, cause Love comes in spurts - it always hurts I just can't get wise To those tragical lies Though I now know the facts They still cut like an axe Cause love comes in spurts In dangerous flirts And it murders your heart They didn't tell you that part Love comes in spurts Love comes in spurts Love comes in spurts Love comes in spurtsBetrayal takes two  Who did it to who I mean: not to be cut by your dull point of view Feelings will change - we're helpless they must We like it that way - eliminates trust But that cut on your arm where the blood is still fresh And the thought of some harm that comes to yourself...Hey sweetheart cool off, you're not so distraught...You lost what you had but that's what I've got I'll close my eyes while you take off my clothes No wait a while till this feelings goes...The feeling gets stronger, two times emptiness-We'll embrace that much longer, make more of a mess...The senstation of life was aroused in ourself From the plot we digressed, knocked the books off the shelves Then burned down the house, then met in a bar With a motel attached and kissed all the scars We're changed now for good, but I try to insert My face to appear when you love when you flirt.. I withdrew from the street and all humanlike zones I'd had it, I'd had it - I was mush to the bones I covered the windows, I was taking no calls Then I thought for a month inside the alien walls Now I know oh They don't tell you so Now I know, oh They don't tell you so Now I know  Oh They don't tell you so But I can recall it all I called up a girl I'd known for so many years I'd seen her in shock, I'd seen the last of her tears I admired her style from her toes to her brain -She accepted my plan and so she caught the next train Now I know oh They don't tell you so Now I know, oh They don't tell you so Now I know  Oh They don't tell you so But I can recall it allWell, too young to drink and too smart to think Attaches on his head with the missing link He's skinny as a snake and fast as a mink But he ain't for sale unless you add the kitchen sink Well look out, here he comes again They say he's dead, he's my three best friends He's so honest that the dishonest dread Meeting the kid with the replaceable head Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum When you live on a planet the size of a town You can't get your kicks by getting around Yeah, fun's hard to find on such familiar ground So you invent it: the mental, it's better than found Well look out, here he comes again They say he's dead, he's my three best friends He's so honest that the dishonest dread Meeting the kid with the replaceable headOh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Look out liars and you highlife scum Who gotta keep your victims poor and dumb Your motives and your methods are not disguised By your silk, soap, sex, or your smiling lies Your lies Your lies Look out here You pompous jerk Look out here I'll go berserk Well I guess you put me in my place But I won't forget your stupid face They gave you power cause they knew your needs Soprano boys get talent when you shoot your seeds Your seeds Your seeds Well you laugh to hear what your best friends say Old man they laugh when you walk away Away AwayHead wrapped in your hair In a box lined with silk You can't learn to talk And the air is your milk Erasing my face I want you so bad I want to be you It's futile it's sad Oh, oh baby Oh, oh baby Oh, oh baby Oh oh oh I could live with you in another world I could live with you in another world I could live with you in another world Muscle against silk Tears fall from the burn A smell of perfume In a moment you'll turn In a moment you'll turn Your face will change shape We exchange just one gift:To see like an apeLate last night, I went for a walk Down by the river near my home Couldn't believe with my own eyes And I swear I'll never leave my home again I saw a man walking on the water Coming right at me from the other side Calling out my name, ""Do not be afraid""Feet begin to run, pounding in my brain I don't wanna go I don't wanna go No, no, no, no, no I don't wanna goI used to lie in my room and just stare Frustrated eyes flipping pages of air And gaze after gaze, I could see nothing there I was just a flaw in the scheme Of everything but nightmarish dreams No one could stand feeling that way for long So I, I chose to regard all the world as the wrong And to, and to make my own long assertions in song I decided I just didn't care That I'd look, and I could see nothing there But now But now, but now, but now I lie there staring in her eyes I lie there staring in her eyes I watch her be The sight I wanted so much to see Oh, let me tell you about a pleasure I've found First you surrender and stop looking around And then you get the one who you wanna lie down"

neon ray And you find you don't have to search for words For there's nothing to be saidHere you are at my place within your glistening eyes I'm watching your reactions as the thing within you cries And I'm bringing you this message 'cause I think it's time you knew That the kingdom of heaven is within you The incense and the candles and the colors on the wall Your image stands reflected as a princess come to call Your suspicions I'm confirming as you find them all quite true And the kingdom of heaven is within you Through the stained glass windows, moonlight flashes on the choir And splashes on the altar in glows of liquid fire Then it bathes you with its glory and you begin life anew And the kingdom of heaven is within youWell, you finally find your helpless mind is trapped inside your skin You want to leave, but you believe you won't get back again You only know you have to go But still you can't get out You try and try, you die and die You're stopped by your own doubt Reverberation, reverberation You find no peace, it doesn't cease It's deadly irritation It keeps you blind, it's there behind Its every hesitation It holds your thought, your mind is caught You're fixed with fascination You think you'll die, it's just a lie It's backward elevation Reverberation, reverberation You see reverberation In your latest incarnation You think it's a sensation But it's just reverberationI've seen your face before I've known you all my life And though it's new Your image cuts me like a knife And now I'm home And now I'm home And now I'm home to stay The neon from your eyes Is splashing into mine They're so familiar In a way I can't define And now I'm home And now I'm home And now I'm home to stay Though this is our first meeting We needn't bother speaking All we might say is understoodLet me take you to the empty place in my fire engine Let me take you to the empty place in my fire engine It can drive you out of your mind Climb the ladder of your own design in my fire engine Don't you tell it to go slow or stop You've got to work it right up to the top A piercing bolt of neon red Explodes on fire inside your head Let me take you to the empty place in my fire engine Let me take you to the empty place in my fire engine Boiling rhythms making your ears ring Rounding the corners you can feel the ring of my fire engine Close your eyes and you erase Your image you no longer chase A fiery flood engulfs your brain And drowns your thoughts with scarlet rain Let me take you to the empty place in my fire engine Let me take you to the empty place in my fire engine It can drive you out of your mind Climb the ladder of your own design in my fire engineDon't fall down If you see her Don't fall down If you're by her side Don't fall down When you're near

you need her, she is there To ease the pain that fogs you And when you don't need her, from her stare She says she's needing you Don't fall down As you love her Don't fall down She loves only you Don't fall down As you lift her Don't fall down She believes in you Don't fall down From beside her Don't fall down Keep behind her eyes Don't fall down They're behind you Don't fall down As the thought appliesChaos all around me With its fevered clinging But I can hear you singing In the corners of my brain Every doubt that bounds me Every sound of riot Everything is quiet But the song that keeps me sane I can hear your voice, echoing my voice softly I can feel your strength, reinforcing mine If you fear I'll lose my spirit Like a drunkard's wasted wine Don't you even think about it, I'm feeling fine I can hear your voice, echoing my voice softly I can feel your strength, reinforcing mine If you fear I'll lose my spirit Like a drunkard's wasted wine Don't you even think about it, I'm feeling fineThru the rhythm of darkened times Painted black by knowledge crimes And repetition's pointless mime Instilling values the sick define That weaves the fabric that keeps you blind And ties your hands and cloaks your mind But on my stilts, I'm above the slime Come on up If you can make the climb But who am I Who am I Who am I I've smelled the stench from the fumes that rise From the books that rehash the same old lies I've felt the panic that they disguise In the forms of laws of every size I've heard the teachers whining Make you drop out like flies But you know they teach you nonsense'Cause they can't blind your eyes I've seen the fools gold They pawn off as their prize"

und lächelt noch Frisch ans Werk, 's ist gleich getan Hängt ihn auf, den geilen Moloch – ja Sometimes I'm missing a word from my friends Why can't we share the problems hand in hand And when I ask my mirror what is the truth All the funny things you do!Look into my eyes Do you really mean it 'Cause this is no question You have to face the facts in time and Don't forget you're high Wouldn't you rather check what's your confession Green bubbles came out of the crystal thing A sudden cry of an old rain-coated guy And softly grey gnomes were whispering to my ear:All the funny things you do!Look into my eyes Do you really mean it 'Cause this is no question You have to face the facts in time and Don't forget you're high Wouldn't you rather check what's your confession Just an advice: Don't ask your face tonight Don't tell the words you like so much Don't tell, just act in spite Don't try to prove your own brain's might Don't lose the sun, 'cause you need funShe suddenly stood alone Shut down by silver and gold The priest came and kissed her hands My daughter  Soon you'll be released She nodded, yes, she was the one Who ate neighbour's babies They even point at the chimney Down there in the gloomy room Widows versed in law came soon My daughter  We are so polite Cutting the face from her smile Her lungs run into fire Her  flying much higher And then there is the mechanical heart of the god Is always repeating the same She stuttered, ""Yes, she was the one""Who made the  dream Who come from across the sea They cut the tree of her life With their hypnotic knifeListen to me there's a thing I can't say out loud I thought it was you and I was so fucking proud Many a friend walks past your hand, I think that's alright And I don't care anymore about holding you tight Another girl is going through my mind only just that I've been blind Since I know her, I know what's beauty To keep her happy seems my duty Don't you pretend you would understand it's easy for me My head  and I got to Go, I got to be free I know that I would leave you brokenhearted Even you realise that we still stand right where we started Another girl is going through my mind only just I've been blind Since I know her, I know what's beauty To keep her happy seems my duty I'm scared I could do something wrong So I just write another songDown on the football place I saw my sister burning They tied her on a railroad track And made her blue eyes burning Her dog was sitting by her feet The whole night he was howling In dirty pants the judge came down Slavering his golden gown Yes, she was the one Who turned the rain into black The television vulture...They brought my sister to trial Cutting her face from her smile On the holy waterfront The people stand there waiting To see her blonde hair lighted To see her blood drip on the floorOn a telegraph pole An assassin is training his soul Locked up in a fancy room Not very far from doom Intoxicated kids Are ready to quit His desires they scatter His nerves they shatter No window to see No door to flee The heart-attack machine Is out of gear The mighty nightmare-employer Professor of paranoia Is stealing near Seven miles from here Smoke coming out of their eyes Insanity-tigers are licking his hands A short romance A vaporised dance"

come to see you Hope your feelings are the sameWe fill our thoughts with everyday reminders And no remorse for winning none the wiser You can tell when we came together How long it lasts that's where it stays We know each other I get the love that you're sending Let the good times be never ending We know each other I get the love that you're sending Let the good times be never ending And in-between a place for new beginnings To fill our dreams instead we keep on winning Take the past send present to the future Make it last slow down we'll get there sooner We know each other I get the love that you're sending Let the good times be never ending We know each other I get the love that you're sending Let the good times be never endingMost of the time you are happy You're a weirdo And before the introduction ends There is someone feeling sorry for themselves Look at your ugly shame What are you talking for Look at your ugly shame Most of the time you are demanding What am I doing here and I don't want to Be And the hurt in which you bare You could say goodbye to this earth Look at your ugly shame What are you talking for Look at your ugly shame There's too much for me to know about Most of the time you are happy You're a weirdo And your nerve is my device And it makes me sadI too feel the plastic machinery I know it's hard to be accepted Our life is just like a dream to me At times it's good to be rejected So, let's just run Even if Only in our heads Leave all of this behind Unless we could stand still It's not that we have no interest It's not that we don't think it's worth it Oh wait I am such an idiot My shoulders find this hard to take it You can tell me, tonight If not this time Your thoughts don't need Don't need to be confined I feel it too This broken world There is no second chance Our flags unfoldMy beautiful friend I will pay attention don't say this is the end I find it hard to describe you To point and discover you Could I tell you once again Ah-oh Ah-oh My beautiful friend Let me sleep and I will feed you when you're hungry Forever live inside of me Through the holes in the pockets of my clothes High, as high as an angel I will stand there beside you Love is all we need Ah-oh, ah-oh My, my, my beautiful friend Ah-oh, ah-oh My, my, my beautiful friend My beautiful friend I swear I adore you Ain't no woman deep enough I don't know how we made it this far dear Without losing at least an ear I could leave us, I could leave us a painting Our lives are-a-changingJoy, it’s such a joy Watching the smile on your face Your love get up at my face We are working it through A solution for you and for me Nothing between what will be Come home baby Come home baby Kiss me gently I can't wait Don't hesitate Let's be together Words can mean many things Watching you step in time Leaving the bad days behind No one can take your place Maybe I'm out of step Maybe I'm out of my depthI wanna bomb your submarines You don't do anything for me You were sometimes hard to find You were never safe to be with, then You, you're nothing next to me I'm a phenomena you see You were sometimes hard to find You were never safe to be with, then Furious again, furious again You don't do anything for me We´re a phenomena you see You were sometimes hard to find You were never safe to be with, thenThis one knows she comes and goes And when she goes she goes This one knows she comes and goes And when she goes she goes Sproston Green she used to pace me And now she hasn't got the time I know I'm too necessary And everything she stole was mine This one knows she comes and goes And when she goes she goes This one knows she comes and goes And when she goes she goes Sproston Green she used to pace me And now she hasn't got the time I know I'm too necessary And everything she stole was mineLet all the pretty ones come on to me I have deity and dignity With your inner sense I'll come for free But shutters hide me in this property Let all the pretty ones come on to me I have deity and dignity With your inner sense I'll come for free But shutters hide me in this property I will sit back down and wait For a chance I will create With words I anticipate Games I will participate Dark blinds drawn will lose the day I would rather live this way I don't want my mind to stray So I keep the world at bay Out with the stranger hands on my mouth Lost in a concrete undergrowth Another disaster only tells me is true Hope I recover long after we're through When will you come and save yourself Stop me, I am drifting, I'm tired of myself I'm tired of myself, trying to control Your pure soul, your pure soul"

this is war au-go-go There's plenty good money to be made By supplying the Army with the tools of its trade Just hope and pray that if they drop the bomb They drop it on the Viet CongThe white ducks fly on past the sun Their wings flash silver at the moon While waters rush down the mountain tongue My organs play a circus tune I dance to the wonder of your feet And sing to the joy of your knees The cold white dress on the mountain breast Paints the frozen trees The maple plants patterns in the sky Its leaves to kiss the wind While scores of glittering bugs and flies Dance polkas on her limbs I whistle symphonies of your face And laugh for your hair so fine In startled greens of playground grass A child jumps rope to rhyme Reeds and brass, the marching drums Make a joyous sound Trees bend low with nuts and plums Then fall to find the ground I hunger for your porpoise mouth And stand erect for love The sun burns up the winter sky And all the earth is loveI was stuck on an L A freeway Got rainwater in my boots My thumbs done froze, can't feel my toes I'm feeling a little thirsty, too Wheels throwin' water all over my axe And Mr  Jones won't lend me a hand Up come two cats in a Cadillac And they say won't you hop in, man I went flying high All the way All the way The one that's driving has got a Bowler hat The other's got a Fez on his head They turn around and grin and I grin back But not a word was said So I took out my harp and I played 'em a tune I could see they were diggin' it Then the one with the Fez, well he turns and he says We'd like to help you make your trip And I went flying high All the way All the way He said we can't leave him out in the rain He just might freeze and die So, why not put him on a plane And send him home in the sky So, they took me to the L A airport Laid twenty dollars in my hand Well, I paid my fare, I'm in the air Flyin' back home again And I went flying high All the way Yah, all the way All the way You know I went flying high All the wayLook, up yonder in the sky, now, what is that I pray It's a bird it's a plane, it's a man insane, it's my President L BJ He's flying high way up in the sky just like Superman But I

got a chance Gonna send you back to Texas, make you work on your ranch Yeah, yeah, oh yeah He can call Super Woman and his Super Dogs But it sure won't do him no good Yeah, I found out why from a Russian spy That he ain't nothing but a comic book We'll pull him off the stands and clean up the land Yes, we'll have us a brand new day What is more I got the Fantastic Four And Doctor Strange to help him on his way Said come out Lyndon with your hands held high Drop your guns, baby, and reach for the sky We got you surrounded and you ain't got a chance Gonna send you back to Texas make you work on your ranch Yeah yeah, oh yeahHey partner, won't you pass that reefer round My world is spinnin', yeah, just got to slow it down Oh, yes you know I've sure got to slow it down Get so high this time that you know I'll never come down, I'll never come down I believe I'll go out to the seashore, let the waves wash my mind Open up my head now just to see what I can find Oh, yes you know I'm gonna see what I can find Just one more trip now, you know I'll stay high All the time, all the time Yes, I'll go out to the desert just to try and find my past Truth lives all around me, but it's just beyond my grasp Oh, yes you know it's just beyond my grasp I'll let the sand and the stars and the wind Carry me back, oh carry me back L.S.D L.S.D L.S.DMovin' down that rock coast line Oh, nothin' but my woman on my mind Hear those waves poundin' on sand Smell that sea air blowin' inland I wonder if she's found another man, oh!Black stone roadway by the sea Oh, I wonder if she's a-missing me Four-wheeled clock keeps tickin' off time Measured minutes by a broken white line Wonder if I'm really on her mind, oh And now in my thoughts I feel her eyes Feel her smilin' by my side Then I turn around and see There's nobody sittin' here but me, yeah!Rubber tired, oh lonesome song Tells me that I've done something wrong Days before and then we parted I wonder why I even started Thinkin' I've been gone far too long Moving past those rocks and waves I wonder how she spends her days Watch the sun as we go by Throwin' colors off the water sky Thinkin' about the rainbows in my baby's eyesBring flowers and ring them 'round her grass hair Bring leaves from the mountain and boxes of air Bring baskets of food and things you can share And the moon will shine in her eyes She will stand in the sea with her body like sand And the dolphins will come kiss the palms of her hands As she opens her soul to the water and land Her smiles will color the sky With bottles of light and sacks of clay With music to dance and songs to play With lemons and candles you'll see the way That the moon will shine in her eyes She will fly on the wind with her face to the sun Children will dance all around her for fun Just ask her for love and she'll give you some For her smiles will color the skyRed and swollen tears Tumble from her eyes While cold silver birds Who came to cruise the skies Send death down to bend And twist her tiny hands And then proceed to T AR GE T B In keeping with their plans Khaki priests of Christendom Interpreters of love Ride a stone Leviathan Across a sea of blood And pound their feet into the sand Of shores they've never seen Delegates from the western land To join the death machine And we send cards and letters The oxen lie beside the road Their bodies baked in mud And fat flies chew out their eyes Then bathe themselves in blood And super heroes fill the skies Tally sheets in hand Yes, keeping score in times of war Takes a superman The junk crawls past hidden death Its cargo shakes inside And soldier children hold their breath And kill them as they hide And those who took so long to learn The subtle ways of death Lie and bleed in paddy mud With questions on their breath And we send prayers and praisesSome people, they find each other I found you I found you I found you I found you I found you I found you"

Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh Ahhh-ah-ahI have often told you stories About the way I lived the life of a drifter Waiting for the day When I'd take your hand And sing you songs Then maybe you would say""Come lay with me and love me""And I would surely stay But I feel I'm growing older And the songs that I have sung Echo in the distance Like the sound Of a windmill going around I guess I'll always be A soldier of fortune Many times I've been a traveler I looked for something new In days of old When nights were cold I wandered without you But those days I thought my eyes Had seen you standing near Though blindness is confusing It shows that you're not hereCan you remember, remember my name As I flow through your life A thousand oceans I have flown Oh-oh-oh And cold, cold spirits of ice, ah, ah All my life I am the echo of your past I am returning the echo of a point in time And distant faces shine A thousand warriors I have known Oh, oh-oh-oh And laughing as the spirits appear All your life Shadows of another day And if you hear me talking on the wind You've got to understand We must remain perfect strangers Ah, ah, ah, no I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow A strand of silver hanging through the sky Touching more than you see The voice of ages in your mind, oh-oh-oh Is aching with the dead of the night Oh-uh-oh, precious life Your tears are lost in falling rain And if you hear me talking on the wind You've got to understand We must remain perfect strangers Oh, oh-oh Oh, yeahNobody gonna take my car I'm gonna race it to the ground Nobody gonna beat my car It's gonna break the speed of sound Ooh, it's a killing machine It's got everything Like a driving power Big fat tires and everything I love it And I need it I bleed it Yeah, it's a wild hurricane Alright, hold tight I'm a highway star Nobody gonna take my girl I'm gonna keep her to the end Nobody gonna have my girl She stays close on every bend Ooh, she's a killing machine She's got everything Like a moving mouth Body control and everythingNa-na-na-na Na-na-na, na-na-na Na-na-na-na Na-na-na, na-na-na I got a certain little girl, she's on my mind No doubt about it, she looks so fine She's the best girl that I ever had Sometimes she's gonna make me feel so bad Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na Hush, hush I thought I heard her calling my name now Hush, hush She broke my heart but I love her just the same now Hush, hush Thought I heard her calling my name now Hush, hush I need her loving and I'm not to blame nowThe sky is red, I don't understand Past midnight I still see the land People are saying the woman is damned She makes you burn with a wave of her hand The city's ablaze, the town's on fire The woman's flames are reaching higher We were fools, we called her a liar All I hear is""Burn!""I didn't believe she was the devil's sperm She said, ""Curse you all, you'll never learn""""When I leave there's no return""The people laughed till she said, ""Burn!""Warning came, no one cared Earth was shaking, we stood and stared When it came no one was spared Still I hear""Burn!""You know we had no time We could not even try You know we had no timeIf you're leaving, close the door I'm not expecting people, anymore Hear me grieving, lying on the floor Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure I'm a blind man I'm a blind man And my world is pale When a blind man cries Lord, you know There ain't a sadder tale Had a friend once, in a room Had a good time But it ended much too soon In a cold month, in that room We found a reason For the things we had to do I'm a blind man I'm a blind man Now my room is cold When a blind man cries Lord, you know He feels it from his soulThere once was a woman A strange kind of woman The kind that gets written down in history Her name was Nancy Her face was nothing fancy She left a trail of happiness and misery I loved her Everybody loved her She loved everyone and gave them good return I tried to take her I even tried to break her She said, ""I ain't for taking, won't you ever learn ""I want you, I need you, I got to be near you I spent my money as I took my turn I want you, I need you, I got to be near you Ooh, I got a strange kind of woman She looked like a raver But I could never please her On Wednesday mornings boy, you can't go far I couldn't get her But things got better, she said""Saturday nights from now on baby, you're my star""I want you, I need you, I got to be near you I spent my money as I took my turn I want you, I need you, I got to be near you Ooh, I got a strange kind of womanSweet Lucy was a dancer But none of us would chance her Because she was a samurai She made electric shadows Beyond our fingertips And none of us could reach that high She came on like a teaser I had to touch and please her Enjoy a little paradise The log was in my pocket When Lucy met the rocket She never knew the reason why I can't deny it With that smile on her face Oh, it's not the kill It's the thrill of the chase Feel it coming It's knocking at the door You know it's no good running It's not against the law The point of no return Now you know the score And now you're learning Ah-ha, what's knocking at your back door "

Grateful Dead,acid rock artists,10,"Let my inspiration flow In token rhyme suggesting rhythm That will not forsake me'Til my tale is told and done While the firelight's aglow Strange shadows from the flames will grow'Til things we've never seen Will seem familiar Shadows of a sailor forming Winds both foul and fair all swarm Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady Many years ago Here beside him stands a man A soldier from the looks of him Who came through many fights But lost at love While the storyteller speaks A door within the fire creaks Suddenly flies open And a girl is standing thereTruckin', got my chips cashed in Keep truckin', like the do-dah man Together, more or less in line Just keep truckin' on Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street Your typical city involved in a typical daydream Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings Dallas, got a soft machine;Houston, too close to New Orleans;New York's got the ways and means But just won't let you be, oh no Most of the cats that you meet on the streets speak of true love Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home One of these days they know they gotta get goin'Out of the door and down to the street all alone Truckin', like the do-dah man Once told me ""You've got to play your hand""Sometimes the cards ain't worth a dime If you don't lay'em downIf my words did glow with the gold of sunshine And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung Would you hear my voice come through the music Would you hold it near as it were your own It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken Perhaps they're better left unsung I don't know, don't really care Let there be songs to fill the air Ripple in still water When there is no pebble tossed Nor wind to blow Reach out your hand, if your cup be empty If your cup is full, may it be again Let it be known there is a fountain That was not made by the hands of men There is a road, no simple highway Between the dawn and the dark of night And if you go, no one may follow That path is for your steps aloneAs I was walking round Grosvenor Square Not a chill to the winter But a nip to the air From the other direction She was calling my eye It could be an illusion But I might as well try Might as well try She had rings on her fingers and Bells on her shoes And I knew without asking she was Into the blues She wore scarlet begonias Tucked into her curls I knew right away She was not like other girls Other girls In the thick of the evening When the dealing got rough She was too pat to open And too cool to bluff As I picked up my matches and Was closing the door I had one of those flashes:I'd been there before Been there beforeMust be getting early Clocks are running late Paint by number morning sky looks so phony Dawn is breaking everywhere Light a candle, curse the glare Draw the curtains, I don't care 'cause it's alright I will get by I will get by I will get by I will survive I see you've got your fist out Say your piece and get out Yes, I get the gist of it, but it's alright Sorry that you feel that way The only thing there is to say Every silver lining's got a touch of grey I will get by I will get by I will get by I will surviveI lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds Didn't get to sleep that night 'til the morning came around Set out runnin' but I take my time A friend of the devil is a friend of mine If I get home before daylight Just might get some sleep tonight Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills Spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills Set out runnin' but I take my time A friend of the devil is a friend of mine If I get home before daylight Just might get some sleep tonight I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there He took my twenty dollar bill and he vanished in the air Set out runnin' but I take my time A friend of the devil is a friend of mine If I get home before daylight Just might get some sleep

eel, fantastic snake Take my love when it's free Electric feel with me You call it loud, but the human crowd Doesn't mean shit to a tree Change the strings and notes slide Change the bridge and string shift down Shift the notes and bridge sings Fire eating people Rising toys of the sun Energy dies without body warm Icicles ruin your gunLather was thirty years old today They took away all of his toys His mother sent newspaper clippings to him About his old friends who'd stopped being boys There was Howard C  Green Just turned thirty-three His leather chair waits at the bank And Sergeant Dow Jones Twenty-seven years old Commanding his very own tank But Lather still finds it A nice thing to do To lie about nude in the sand Drawing pictures of mountains That look like bumps And thrashing the air with his hands But wait, oh Lather's productive, you know He produces the finest of sound Putting drumsticks on either side of his nose Snorting the best licks in town But that's all overEvery day I try so hard to know your mind And find out what's inside you Time goes on and I don't know just where you are Or how I'm going to find you You can do whatever you please The world's waiting to be seized You can collect all the neglect Or all the self-respect you need And I know And I know And I know Your mind's guaranteed It's all you'll ever need So what do you want with me We live but once but good things can be found around In spite of all the sorrow If you see black you can't look back You can't look front you cannot face tomorrow Some have it nice Flash paradise They're very wise to their disguise Trying to revolutionize tomorrowIf you want to get to heaven Over on the other shore Stay out of the way of the blood stained bandit Oh good shepherd, feed my sheep One for Paul, one for Silas One for to make my heart rejoice Can't you hear my lambs a callin'Oh good shepherd, feed my sheep If you want to get to heaven Over on the other shore Stay out of the way of the long tongue liar Oh good shepherd, feed my sheep One for Paul, one for Silas One for to make my heart rejoice Can't you hear my lambs a callin Oh good shepherd feed my sheep If you want to get to heaven Over on the other shore Stay out of the way of the gun shot devil Oh good shepherd, feed my sheep"

Grace Slick,acid rock artists,10,"Oh I, I believe in magic and I believe in dreams Until I heard the thunder rumble I saw the mountains crumble Then came the circus so I followed its parade With all the fancy lion-tamers High-wire, fiery flamers Ravers of every kind I saw those high-steppin', sexy witches Sons of satin, sons of bitches All were there, in my dreams All in my dreams Sodom & Gomorrah, I see you're back in town And though you build a wall around you The multitude still found you Just like the circus to start with a parade Oh, but a parade of the fancy lion-tamers High-wire, fiery flamers Ravers of every kind With all those high-steppin', sexy witches Sons of satin, sons of bitches All were there, in my dreams All in my dreamsSometimes it's easy to believe it Sound may be the warmest thing he's found He just starts playing, then he says to me:""Ready your body for love, there is no gravity here Look up - the roof is gone and the long hand moves Right on by the hour Look up - the roof is gone The roof is gone, the roof is gone La musica de espana es para mi como Ia libertad Canta como si la libertad es suiyo Convenir resuena para escapar Escuche viento norte escuche Como corneta nevada corneta cantar Alrededor vient oriente vient oriente Enroyar disenroyar Querdas que gritan Querdas que cantan Spanish wind keeps telling me How it feels to sing free It keeps blowing on me, and it s showing me Another way, another way to listen And if you hear, if you hear the wind singing like Someone singing for your love The more it sings the more you know Horns and strings and time will show you Show - show you, show you freedomGegan El Diablo I can feel your power in my soul Dancing like your puppet though I try to break your hold Half succeeding still I find I'm healing quickly You'll not trick me one more time El Diablo you are like a fountain blowing dust Peddler of delusion, dire confusion and disgust As you hook your mark with joyous heart you up the price Take your pleasure elsewhere cast your gaze not on my life El Diablo I can feel your power in my soul Dancing like your puppet though I try to break your hold Half succeeding still I find I'm healing quickly You'll not trick me one more time El Diablo I can hear you calling in the night Pass me by in silence I'll not follow you tonight Beat your breast like thunder vent your anger with a howl You'll not pull me under I'll not tremble at your growlShe's been living too high trying to get to heaven at night They all knew she was bound to go down 'way before she fell They all know how it feels to try and hold on to the light They know the darkness of the night sky so well But there's just no way to tell her She'll do it the hard way She's gonna break right through the sign that says This is the end of the ride She'll do it the hard way She's gonna shake the hands of time and try to Turn back the tide She'll do it the hard way She's gonna take whatever she can find until there's No one by her side And there's no place left to hide She said I'm gonna get more out of living every day She said I know how to get more out of life if I just had more time If I can just keep on taking when someone else is giving it away That way the sweet life - That'll be all mine in no time But there's just no more time for herToo much of life has fallen through my hands I pray the lord I get another chance To face the raging storm and test it's hands Face to the wind Too many hours making future plans Afraid to gaze upon the dealer's hand But you know he's due to call so make your stand Face to the wind, Face to the wind Like a boat upon the river swept drifting out to sea I cast my fate to the wind And the storm hangs like a dagger to cut me in the heart But still I stand Face to the wind Face to the wind Face to the wind Face to the wind There's a guiding light, a lantern burning bright To light my way And a demon daring me to look him in the eye Straight in the eye Straight in the eye Like a boat upon the river swept drifting out to sea I cast my fate to the wind And the storm hangs like a dagger to cut me in the heart But still I stand Face to the wind Face to the wind Face to the windCheaters -

Don't look too far, you can find it everywhere You can lose it without a warning If you grab on too tight Try to read too much into it You know it's only music That song - the one your hear inside late at night It can set you reeling That song, that song is just your own Heart beating, but it can sound like a symphony You hear a voice so clear you can't tell what its saying Well maybe you now that tune you hear Might never end I thought that I heard you singing at night You know I had the feeling That I, I have known that song Way beyond this life without beginning Who knows the name of that song Go broke and come back singing Since the world appeared Get write it down Cos it doesn't spell It doesn't end In the still, the still of the night When the wind is quiet Quiet and still I sit inside, the empty room Waiting hear the tune that Comes stealing through the mazes - writ on empty pages"
Steppenwolf,acid rock artists,10,"{Instrumental Intro 00:00-00:29}I like to dream Yes, yes, right between the sound machine On a cloud of sound, I drift in the night Any place it goes is right Goes far, flies near to the stars away from here Well, you don't know what we can find Why don't you come with me, little girl On a magic carpet ride You don't know what we can see Why don't you tell your dreams to me Fantasy will set you free Close your eyes, girl Look inside, girl Let the sound take you away Last night I held Aladdin's lamp And so I wished that I could stay Before the thing could answer me Well, someone came and took the lamp away I looked around, a lousy candle's all I foundGet your motor runnin'Head out on the highway Looking for adventure In whatever comes our way Yeah, darlin', go and make it happen Take the world in a love embrace Fire all of your guns at once And explode into space I like smoke and lightnin'Heavy metal thunder Racing with the wind And the feeling that I'm under Yeah, darlin', go and make it happen Take the world in a love embrace Fire all of your guns at once And explode into space Like a true nature's child We were born, born to be wild We can climb so high I never wanna die Born to be wild Born to be wildYou know I've smoked a lot of grass O' Lord, I've popped a lot of pills But I never touched nothin'That my spirit could kill You know, I've seen a lot of people walkin' 'round With tombstones in their eyes But the pusher don't care Ah, if you live or if you die God damn, the pusher God damn, I say the pusher I said God damn God damn the pusher man You know the dealer, the dealer is a man With the love grass in his hand Oh but the pusher is a monster Good God, he's not a natural man The dealer for a nickel Lord, will sell you lots of sweet dreams Ah, but the pusher ruin your body Lord, he'll leave your He'll leave your mind to screamStarin' at the boob tube, turnin' on the big knob Tryin' to find some life in the waste land Fin'ly found a program, gonna deal with Mary Jane Ready for a trip into hate land Obnoxious Joe comes on the screen Along with his guest self-righteous Sam And one more guy who doesn't count His hair and clothes are too far out While pushin' back his glasses Sam is sayin' casually""I was elected by the masses""And with that in mind he starts to unwind A vicious attack on the finest of grasses Well it's evil, wicked, mean and nasty And it will ruin our fair country Well, it will hook your Sue and Johnny All will pay that disagree with me Misinformation Sam and Joe Are feeding to the nation But the one who didn't count counted them out By exposing all their false quotations Faced by a very awkward situation This is all he'd say to save the dayWhen rain drops fall and you feel low Ah, do you ever think it's useless Do you feel like letting go Do you ever sit and do you wonder Will the world ever change And just how long will it take To have it all rearranged Tell me why these things are still the same Tell me why no one can seem to learn from mistakes Take my hand if you don't know where you're goin'I'll understand, I've lost the way myself Oh, don't take that old road it leads to nowhere We must return before the clock strikes twelve It's so easy to do nothin'When you're busy night and day Take a step in one direction And take a step the other way So don't quit tryin' when you stumble Don't give up should you fall Keep on searchin' for the passway That will lead you through the wall Don't look back or you'll be left behind Don't look back or you will never find peace of mindYour eyes are moist, you scream and shout As though you were a man possessed From deep inside comes rushing forth All the anguish you suppressed Up on your wall hangs your degree Your parents craved so much for you And though you're trained to make your mark You still don't quite know what to do It's never too late to start all over again To love the people you caused the pain And help them learn your name Oh, no, not too late It's never too late to start all over again Well, it's much too late to start again To try and find a little bliss So on your woman and your child You release your bitterness You drift apart some more each day You feel the guilt and loneliness And the God of your childhood you can't find To save you from your emptiness It's never too late to start all over again To love the people you caused the pain And help them learn your name Oh, no, not too late It's never too late to start all over againOnce the religious, the hunted, and weary Chasing the promise of freedom and hope Came to this country to build a new vision Far from the reaches of kingdom and pope Like good Christians, some would burn the witches Later some got slaves to gather riches But still from near and far to seek America They came by thousands, to court the wild But she just patiently smiled and bore them a child To be their spirit and guiding light And once the ties with the crown had been broken Westward in saddle and wagon, they went And 'til the railroad linked ocean to ocean Many the lives which had come to an end While we bullied, stole, and bought our homeland We began the slaughter of the red manYou say it was this morning when you last saw your good friend Lying on the pavement with a misery on his brain Stoned on some new potion he found upon the wall Of some unholy bathroom in some ungodly hall He only had a dollar to live on till next Monday But he spent it all on comfort for his mind Did you say you think he's blind Someone should call his parents, a sister or a brother And they'll come to take him back home on a bus But he'll always be a problem to his poor and puzzled mother Yeah he'll always be another one of us He said he wanted heaven but prayin' was too slow So he bought a one-way ticket on an airline made of snow Did you say you saw your good friend flyin' low Flyin' low, dyin' slow You say it was this morning when you last saw your good friend Lying on the pavement with a misery on his brain Stoned on some new potion he found upon the wall Of some unholy bathroom in some ungodly hall He only had a dollar to live on till next Monday He said he wanted heaven but prayin' was too slow So he bought a one-way ticket on an airline made of snow Did you say you saw your good friend flyin' low Dyin' slow, flyin' low Did you say you saw your good friend flyin' low Dyin' slow, flyin' low Blinded by snowWe'll call you when you're six years old And drag you to the factory To train your brain for eighteen years With promise of security But then you're free And forty years you waste to chase the dollar sign So you may die in Florida At the pleasant age of sixty nine The water's getting hard to drink We've mangled up the country side The air will choke you when you breathe We're all committing suicide But it's alright It's progress folks keep pushin' till your body rots Will strip the earth of all its green And then divide her into parking lots But there's nothing you and I can do You and I are only two What's right and wrong is hard to say Forget about it for today We'll stick our heads into the sand Just pretend that all is grand Then hope that everything turns out okShe asked me maybe I could share her sorrow For all the men that tried to treat her wrong Though just a baby, awaiting her tomorrow It's rock me baby, rock me baby, all night long She needs an answer to her confusion Someone to guide her with tenderness But when she's askin' for a solution All that she gets, you know, is something like this I don't know where we come from Don't know where we're goin' to But if all this should have a reason We would be the last to know So let's just hope there is a promised land Hang on 'til then As best as you can Ev'rybody's ills, you know it fills her with compassion That's why she tries to save the world alone She helps the needy in her own fashion And tries to give them all her own She needs an answer to her confusion Someone to guide her with tenderness But when she's askin' for a solution All that she gets, you know, is Something like this"

or sail You cut the summer blonde from your hair A little time is all I need A disco bloodbath for the ages The patience left to let it bleed And a quill to fill the pages Side streets set ablaze And all roads lead to maybe Sometimes I think about those days Sometimes I wish we'd kept the baby I don't know how things could have changed At the latest Our days in Kansas wouldn't last I never learned the K U fight song Exchanging poisons from the past I hadn't heard from you in so long And if the moonlight kills the flame With all the moments we were meant to You know I'll tell the world your name I couldn't let the world forget you Things were so much easier back in 1993 I loved you for the first time on that dayAntenna towers, and distant hopes I've measured happiness with telescopes Well, I've been face to face with what my future brings The reels they turn recording blips and pings Through the white noise and distortion There's a message I can feel Just give me one sign that you're real An orange glow, some blinking lights Don't know how most folks spend their Friday nights Well I've seen evidence no one would dare dispute Witness accounts make up my life's pursuit And in those

an end Look at me now, will I ever learn I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control There's a fire within my soul Just one look and I can hear a bell ring One more look and I forget everything, whoa Mamma mia, here I go again My my, how can I resist you Mamma mia, does it show again My my, just how much I've missed you Yes, I've been broken-hearted Blue since the day we parted Why, why did I ever let you go Mamma mia, now I really know My my, I could never let you go I've been angry and sad about things that you do I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through And when you go, when you slam the door I think you know that you won't be away too long You know that I'm not that strongYou can dance, you can jive Having the time of your life Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene Digging the dancing queen Friday night and the lights are low Looking out for a place to go Where they play the right music, getting in the swing You come to look for a king Anybody could be that guy Night is young and the music's high With a bit of rock music, everything is fine You're in the mood for a dance And when you get the chance You are the dancing queen Young and sweet, only seventeen Dancing queen Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah You can dance, you can jive Having the time of your life Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene Digging the dancing queenI don't wanna talk About things we've gone through Though it's hurting me, now it's history I've played all my cards And that's what you've done, too Nothing more to say, no more ace to play The winner takes it all The loser's standing small Beside the victory That's her destiny I was in your arms Thinking I belonged there I figured it made sense, building me a fence Building me a home Thinking I'd be strong there But I was a fool playing by the rules The gods may throw the dice Their minds as cold as ice And someone way down here Loses someone dear The winner takes it all The loser has to fall It's simple and it's plain Why should I complain  "

Ryan Adams,adult alternative artists,10,"It's so hard to be without you Lying in the bed, you are so much to be without Rattles in my head that empty drum filled with doubt Everything you lose, the

Adele,adult alternative artists,10,"Hello, it's me I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet To go over everything They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing Hello, can you hear me I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be When we were younger and free I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet There's such a difference between us And a million miles Hello from the other side I must've called a thousand times To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done But when I call, you never seem to be home Hello from the outside At least, I can say that I've tried To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore Hello, how are you It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry I hope that you're well Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened There ain't no gold in this river That I've been washin' my hands in forever I know there is hope in these waters But I can't bring myself to swim When I am drowning in this silence Baby, let me in Go easy on me, baby I was still a child Didn't get the chance to Feel the world around me I had no time to choose what I chose to do So go easy on me There ain't no room for things to change When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways You can't deny how hard I've tried I changed who I was to put you both first But now I give up Go easy on mе, baby I was still a child Didn't get the chance to Feel thе world around me Had no time to choose what I chose to do So go easy on meI heard that you're settled down That you found a girl and you're married now I heard that your dreams came true Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend, why are you so shy Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it I had hoped you'd see my face And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you, too Don't forget me, I beg I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead You know how the time flies Only yesterday was the time of our lives We were born and raised in a summer haze Bound by the surprise of our glory daysThere's a fire starting in my heart Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark Finally, I can see you crystal clear Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare See how I'll leave with every piece of you Don't underestimate the things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark The scars of your love remind me of us They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all The scars of your love, they leave me breathless I can't help feeling We could've had it all Rolling in the deep You had my heart inside of your hand And you played it to the beat Baby, I have no story to be told But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn Think of me in the depths of your despair Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be sharedEverybody loves the things you do From the way you talk to the way you move Everybody here is watching you'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true But if by chance you're here alone Can I have a moment before I go 'Cause I've been by myself all night long Hoping you're someone I used to know You look like a movie You sound like a song My God, this reminds me Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light In case it is the last time that we might Be exactly like we were before we realised We were sad of getting old, it made us restless It was just like a movie It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears Nobody told me that you'd be here And I swear you'd moved overseas That's what you said when you left meI let it fall, my heart And as it fell, you rose to claim it It was dark, and I was over Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they were strong But my knees were far too weak To stand in your arms Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you That I never knew, never knew All the things you'd say They were never true, never true And the games you'd play You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain Watched it pour as I touched your face Well, it burned while I cried'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name Your nameI will leave my heart at the door I won't say a word They've all been said before, you know So why don't we just play pretend Like we're not scared of what is coming next Or scared of having nothing left Look, don't get me wrong I know there is no tomorrow All I ask is If this is my last night with you Hold me like I'm more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use Take me by the hand while we do What lovers do It matters how this ends'Cause what if I never love again I don't need your honesty It's already in your eyes And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me No one knows me like you do And since you're the only one that mattered Tell me, who do I run to Just the guitar Okay, cool This was all you, none of it me You put your hands on, on my body and told me Mmm, told me you were ready For the big one, for the big jump I'd be your last love, everlasting, you and me Mmm, that was what you told me I'm giving you up I've forgiven it all You set me free Send my love to your new lover Treat her better We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts We both know we ain't kids no more Send my love to your new lover Treat her better We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts We both know we ain't kids no moreHello, it's me I was

The Airborne Toxic Event,adult alternative artists,10,"And it starts sometime around midnight Or at least that's when you lose yourself for a minute or two As you stand under the bar lights And the band plays some song About forgetting yourself for a while And the piano's this melancholy soundtrack to her smile And that white dress she's wearing You haven't seen her for a while But you know that she's watching She's laughing, she's turning She's holding her tonic like a crux The room's suddenly spinning She walks up and asks how you are So you can smell her perfume You can see her lying naked in your arms And so there's a change in your emotions And all these memories come rushing Like feral waves to your mind Of the curl of your bodies like two perfect circles entwined And you feel hopeless and homeless And lost in the haze of the wine Then she leaves with someone you don't know But she makes sure you saw her She looks right at you and bolts As she walks out the door Your blood boiling, your stomach in ropes Oh, and your friends say ""What is it You look like you've seen a ghost""I can only say these things to you while you’re sleeping I hear the hum from the wires, the sounds of the morning creeping I lie awake and pretend you can hear me You tell me that you’re scared that you’re turning into your mother I feel myself turning into my father We could lie to each other like they do and say we’re so happy It’s easy when you’re young and you still want it so badly And I feel my heart pounding And I think I might scream...I can tell you that you’re all I’ve ever wanted, dear I can utter every word you’ve ever hoped to hear I shudder when I think that I might not be here forever, forever, forever In the night you whisper like a ghost and you look so shaken You're so quiet and small and you tell me you want to be taken I just never think of you as the kind of girl who would say that And you suddenly seem like some faceless thing in my grasp Your eyes alight, your face aglow It's the face of someone I don't know I can tell that you’re all I’ve ever wanted, dear I can utter every word you’ve ever hoped to hear I shudder when I think I might not be here forever, forever, foreverAll these buckets of rain I've heard enough about You say that I lie I am a gentleman Didn't I ask for a place I could stay What were we both thinking The next part just got in the way You were just always talking about changing, changing What if I was the same man, same man The same I always was All these things that you say Like I'll forget about The mind-numbing games that you play I am a gentleman Didn't I pay for every laugh every dime Every bit every time And then you feed me some lie I won't hear one more word about changing, changing Guess what I am the same man, same man Same man I've always beenFive, six, seven, eight!All the time away You're still on my mind But we were on our own Almost all the time And she'll step away For a second or two And I close my eyes And I think of you We were only seventeen We were holding in our screams Like we'd torn it from the pages of some lipstick magazine And you scratch and turn and say, ""Let's burn ourselves up 'til we scream""Like gasoline Oh those tender days At your mother's house And your father would find my hand inside your blouse Well, they tell me that You're married now Oh my dear, I fear I can't understand howEvery night I’m lying here The world crashing through my ears I always hear the same damn thing:“You can’t live your life hanging on a string.”He’s always saying“Stop complaining  You really can’t ever expect too much Boy, you were born with the common touch.”And we fall and fall and fall and fall With our heads soaked up in alcohol One hand on a cigarette, I swear I still got some good moves left I’ve been fifty-eight since I was twenty-three I got sixty-nine problems but one ain’t me And seriously I don’t give a fuck if my answer isn’t good enough Hey, there, tell me man, what’s the answer to this riddle then Is it heroin Or Jesus Christ Big-ass books Or sleepless nights I had a few of those and everyone knows That the common touch ain’t worth the priceBlack lungs, headlights Heading off to the city tonight Out the front door, turn right I was alone, alright alright alright I wonder what they’ll think of me I’ll run away, run away This is my town, this is my night Heading off to the city tonight And she said, “Come on, out with it  Come on, out with it.”“Come on, out with it  Come on, out with it.”“Come on, out with it  Come on, out with it.”“Come on, out with it  Come on, out with it.”Hard words on a hot night“I’ll have a beer, won’t you turn out the light ”From the front door I could hear it right I’m just running dumb and dumb and dumb and dumb I wonder if I’ll be turning back I got twenty bucks in a pocket with my stash I’m not afraid I’m not your “good night”I’m just a shadow of a shadow tonight And she said, “Come on, out with it  Come on, out with it.”Come on, out with it  Come on outTheres a distance in your eyes That's why a smile is always such a surprise When you call and you talk to me I wonder which person you're gonna be She said ""All your songs are sad songs Why do you always have to see the worst of it Could you write me just one love song Put my name somewhere in the middle of it It's not hard to rhyme Elizabeth Just close your eyes boy and take your best guess Cause the truth is hard, isn't it ""She said ""I'll be listening in my favorite white dress.""All these quiet afternoons She said ""I wonder if I've given up my love too soon.""As her hair fell from her curls I said, ""You're pretty uptight for a Mexican girl.""She said ""All your songs are sad songs Why do you always have to make me feel like shit Could you write me just one love song And put my name somewhere in the middle of it And if you called the song Elizabeth All my friends will know that it's about me Cause the truth is hard, isnt' it But don't take too long cause I know you'll come back to me.""Standing on a bus stop Feeling your head pop Out in the night In the kind of night Where you want to be out On the street, on the street Crawling up the walls Like a cat in heat And the air is thin And it blows through your skin And you feel like something Is about to begin But you don't know what And you don't know when So you tear at your hair And you scratch at your skin You wanna run away, run away Just get on the fucking train and leave today And it doesn't matter where you spend the night You just might end up somewhere in a fight, in a fight Or calling your room on a concrete shelf Fighting all alone, with yourself, with yourself And you just wanna feel like a coin that's been tossed In a wishing well, a wishing well A wishing well, a wishing well Well you're tossed in the air And you fell and you fell Through the dark blue waters Where you cast your spell Like you were just a wish that could turn out wellOh and God just leave that Abraham alone He wants a son, he wants a son Everybody wants a home Though I'm not quite sure if poor Isaac would agree""My God,"" he said, ""What did I do To make you wanna watch me bleed ""And I feel sick tonight, I feel just like The dancing flame on a funeral light And I'm not sure if I want you to save me And I'd be less uptight if I knew the sight Of blood was just a weakness And not the whole reason that you made me But sometimes I think it is...Oh and God just go and leave me all alone I'm not your son, I'm not your son Everybody dies alone Was this world not quite hard enough for you I guess like anyone, you've got Your own scores to settle too And I'm so pissed tonight, I feel just like The last remainin' Canaanite And I don't think that I will be returning And if you wanna see the irony And the savage price of piety There’s a lot of us who are going to be burning How does it feel The thing about dreams Is that everything seems Like you're riding a wave It's been forming all day in your mind The thing about time It's all in your mind Days turn to weeks turn to years turn to infinite signs What you're leavin' behind And the hell with the rest You gave them your best You talk through your teeth And the black cigarettes In your hand I've always believed You were more than impossible More than you seem And

Fiona Apple,adult alternative artists,10,"I was staring at the sky, just looking for a star To pray on, or wish on, or something like that I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy Whose reality I knew, was a-hopeless to be had But then the dove of hope began its downward slope And I believed for a moment that my chances Were approaching to be grabbed But as it came down near, so did a weary tear I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag Hunger hurts and I want him so bad, oh, it kills'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up I got to fold cause these hands are too shaky to hold Hunger hurts, but starving works When it costs too much to love And I went crazy again today Looking for a strand to climb, looking for a little hope Baby said he couldn't stay Wouldn't put his lips to mine and a fail to kiss is a fail to cope I said, ""Honey, I don't feel so good, don't feel justified Come on put a little love here in my void,""He said ""It's all in your head,""And I said, ""So's everything"" but he didn't get it I thought he was a man but he was just a little boyI've been thinking about when I was trying to be your friend I thought it was then, but it wasn't, it wasn't genuine I was just so furious, but I couldn't show you'Cause I know you and I know what you can do And I don't want a war with you, I won't afford it You get sore, even when you win And you maim when you're on offense But you kill when you're on defense And you've got them all convinced That you're the means and the end All the V IPs and P YTs and wannabes Afraid of not being your friend And I've always been too smart for that But you know what  My heart was not I took it like a kid, you see The cool kids voted to get rid of me I'm ashamed of what it did to me What I let get done It stole my fun, it stole my fun Fetch the bolt cutters, I've been in here too long Fetch the bolt cutters, I've been in here too long Fetch the bolt cutters, I've been in here too long Fetch the bolt cuttersI've been a bad, bad girl I've been careless with a delicate man And it's a sad, sad world When a girl will break a boy just because she can Don't you tell me to deny it I've done wrong and I want to suffer for my sins I've come to you 'cause I need guidance to be true And I just don't know where I can begin Ooh What I need is a good defense'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal And I need to be redeemed To the one I've sinned against Because he's all I ever knew of love Heaven, help me for the way I am Save me from these evil deeds before I get them done I know tomorrow brings the consequence at hand But I keep livin' this day like the next will never comeI've waited many years Every print I left upon the track Has led me here And next year, it'll be clear This was only leading me to that And by that time, I hope that You love me You love me I move with the trees in the breeze I know that time is elastic And I know when I go All my particles disband and disperse And I'll be back in the pulse And I know none of this will matter in the long run But I know a sound is still a sound around no one And while I'm in this body I want somebody to want And I want what I want and I want You to love me YouI used to walk down the streets On my way to school Grinding my teeth to a rhythm invisible I used my feet to crush dead leaves like they had fallen from trees Just for me, just to be crash cymbals In class, I'd pass the time Drawing a slash for every time The second hand went by a group of five Done twelve times was a minute But Shameika said I had potential Shameika said I had potential Shameika said I had potential Shameika said I had potential I used to march down the windy, windy sidewalks Slapping my leg with a riding crop Thinking it made me come off so tough I didn't smile, because a smile always seemed rehearsed I wasn't afraid of the bullies, and that just made the bullies worseYou didn't see my valentine I sent it via pantomime While you were watching someone else I stared at you and cut myself That's all I'll do cause I'm not free A fugitive too dull to flee I'm amorous but out of reach A still life drawing of a peach I'm a tulip in a cup I stand no chance of growing up I've made my peace, I'm dead, I'm done I watch you live to have my fun I root for you, I love you You you you you I root for you, I love you You you you you I made it to a dinner date My teardrops seasoned every plate I tried to dance but lost my nerve I cramped up in the learning curveLook at how feathered his cocks are See how seamless his frocks are Look at his paper-beating over that rockstar Look at how long she walks and how far Was she lost  Or Maybe she was not for Traveling in the stock car anymore Maybe she spent her formative years Dealing with his contentious fears And endless jeers at her endless tears Or maybe she just got tired of watching him Sniff white off a starlet's breast Treating his wife like less than a guest Getting his girl to clean up his mess Never showing weakness unless it's a ward's season It's the season of the ward And she's trying to cut the cord She's tired of planting her knees on the cold, hard floor of facts Trying to act like the other girl acts And your strike may have been exact But you know that you never really go to the mat You tie everything all pretty in the second act When you know that it didn't go exactly like thatLadies, ladies, ladies, ladies Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies Ruminations on the looming effect and the parallax view And the figure and the form and the revolving door that keeps Turning out more and more good women like you Yet another woman to whom I won't get through Ruminations on the looming effect and the parallax view And the figure and the form and the revolving door that keeps Turning out more and more good women like you Yet another woman to whom I won't get through Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies, take it easy When he leaves me, please be my guest To whatever I might've left in his kitchen cupboards In the back of his bathroom cabinets And oh yes, oh yes, oh yes There's a dress in the closet Don't get rid of it, you'd look good in it I didn't fit in it, it was never mine It belonged to the ex-wife of another ex of mine She left it behind with a note, one line, it said""I don't know if I'm coming across, but I'm really trying""She was very kindEvery single night, I endure the flight Of little wings of white-flamed butterflies in my brain These ideas of mine percolate the mind Trickle down the spine, swarm the belly, swellin' to a blaze That's where the pain comes in like a second skeleton Tryin' to fit beneath the skin, I can't fit the feelings in, oh Every single night's alight with my brain, brain I say to her, why'd I say it to her What does she think of me  That I'm not what I ought to be That I'm what I try not to be, it's got to be somebody else's fault I can't get caught If what I am is what I am 'cause I does what I does Then brother get back, 'cause my breast's gonna bust open The rib is the shell, and a heart is the yolk And I just made a meal for us both to choke on Every single night's a fight with my brain, brainI would beg to disagree But begging disagrees with me I would beg to disagree But begging disagrees with me I told you I didn't wanna go to this dinner You know I don't go for those ones that you bother about So when they say something that makes me start to simmer That fancy wine won't put this fire out, oh Kick me under the table all you want I won't shut up, I won't shut up Kick me under the table all you want I won't shut up, I won't shut up I'd like to buy you a pair of pillow-soled hiking boots To help you with your climb Or rather, to help the bodies that you step over along your route So they won't hurt like mine Kick me under the table all you want I won't shut up, I won't shut up Kick me under the table all you want I won't shut up, I won't shut up"

Arcade Fire,adult alternative artists,10,"In the suburbs, I I learned to drive And you told me we'd never survive Grab your mother's keys, we're leaving You always seemed so sure That one day we'd be fighting in a suburban war Your part of town against mine I saw you standing on the opposite shore But by the time the first bombs fell We were already bored We were already, already bored Sometimes I can't believe it I'm moving past the feeling Sometimes I can't believe it I'm moving past the feeling again The kids want to be so hard But in my dreams, we're still screaming And running through the yard And all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall And all of the houses they built in the seventies finally fall Meant nothing at all Meant nothing at all, it meant nothingTrapped in a prison, in a prism of light Alone in the darkness, darkness of white We fell in love, alone on a stage In the reflective age Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts If this is heaven I don't know what it’s for If I can’t find you there I don't care I thought I found a way to enter It’s just a Reflektor I thought I found the connector But it’s just a Reflektor Now, the signals we send, are deflected again We're so connected, but are we even friends We fell in love when I was nineteen And now we're staring at a screenTake the makeup Off your eyes I've got to see you Hear your sacred sighs Before the break up Comes the silence I'm talking to you You say you're over it But I know I thought I knew you You thought you knew me But now that you do It's not so easy now That I know You can cry, I won't go You can scream, I won't go Every man that you know Would have run at the word go Little boys with their porno Oh, I know they hurt you so They don't know that we know Never know what we knowAfterlife, oh my God, what an awful word After all the breath, and the dirt, and the fires are burnt And after all this time, and after all the ambulances go And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on to the dead light Of the afterglow I've gotta know Can we work it out We scream and shout ‘til we work it out Can we just work it out Scream and shout ‘til we work it out ‘Til we work it out, ‘til we work it out‘Til we work it out, ‘tilwe work it out Afterlife, I think I saw what happens next Oh, it was just a glimpse of you, like looking through a window Or a shallow sea Could you see me And after all this time It's like nothing else we used to know And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on to the dead light Of the afterglow I've gotta knowSomething filled up My heart with nothing Someone told me not to cry But now that I'm older My heart's colder And I can see that it's a lie Children, wake up Hold your mistake up Before they turn the summer into dust If the children don't grow up Our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up We're just a million little gods causing rain storms Turning every good thing to rust I guess we'll just have to adjust With my lightning bolts a-glowing I can see where I am going to be When the reaper he reaches and touches my hand With my lightning bolts a-glowing I can see where I am going With my lightning bolts a-glowing I can see where I am go-going You better look out below Every inch of sky's got a star And every inch of skin's got a scar I guess that you've got everything now And every inch of space in your head Is filled up with the things that you read I guess that you've got everything now And every film that you've ever seen Fills the spaces up in your dreams That reminds me Everything now!Everything now!Every inch of road's got a sign And every boy uses the same line I pledge allegiance to everything now And every song that I've ever heard Is playing at the same time, it's absurd And it reminds me, we've got everything now We turn the speakers up 'til they break'Cause every time you smile, it's a fake Stop pretending, you've got everything

buries my My neighborhood And if my parents are crying Then I'll dig a tunnel from my window to yours Yeah, a tunnel from my window to yours You climb out the chimney and meet me in the middle The middle of the town And since there's no one else around, we let our hair grow long And forget all we used to know Then our skin gets thicker from living out in the snow You change all the lead, sleeping in my head As the day grows dim, I hear you sing a golden hymn Then we tried to name our babies but we forgot all the names that...The names we used to know But sometimes we remember our bedrooms and our parent's bedrooms And the bedrooms of our friends Then we think of our parents, well, what ever happened to them You change all the lead, sleeping in my head to gold As the day grows dim, I hear you sing a golden hymn It’s the song I’ve been trying to singHey, Orpheus!I'm behind you Don't turn around I can find you Just wait until it's over Wait until it's through And if I call for you Oh, Orpheus!Just sing for me all night We'll wait until it's over Wait until it's through You say it's not me, it's you Hey, Orpheus!De l'autre côté de l'eau Comme un écho Just wait until it's over Wait until it's through And if I shout for you Never doubt Don't turn around too soon Just wait until it's over Wait until it's through"

of a bitch you broke my heart I need a little loving To take away the pain How could you let me down When I'm in your care I pull the covers to myself Drink and smoke upon his breath I close my eyes Again i pray to God above What have i done to lose his love Am i to blame Son of a bitch you broke my heart I need a little loving To take away the pain How could you let me down When I'm in your care Ooh somebody's daughter Give me room to breathe There are times when I feel I could drown without water Give me time to see Just one dream that is mine I feel the wind and the water I see the sun and the rain Forgive the sins of your daughter And she will pray for you I'm breaking the frame Each day's the same You should be somebody's daughter Day after day Of feeling this way You should be somebody's daughter Please say I can leave Try to ease this pain that I feel may be killing me Free me from a life That is cold, that is mine I am the dutiful lover I am the perfect mother Forgive the sins of others But please don't pray for meHere’s a man whose voice speaks for everyone And whose actions touch the lives of us all He rose with energy and style Touch my hand, kiss my child Sway us

undertake a vow Tell me who can save us now Save us from the lords of the new church Don't say no Here’s a man some believe he’s a visionary Here’s a man who is driven by greed He made a fortune overnight In a deal that he knew Was too good to be true Now as he bends the rules of play Becomes obsessed with the game Has to go all the wayArienne I realise something's not in your favour Arienne

Strength to live again If there's a God above then show me how the story ends If there's a God above then how could he desert a friend Because I feel so tired And ripped inside And though the tears

the moonlit nights When I wonder why Are the seas still dry Don't blame this sleeping satellite Have we lost what it takes to advance Have we peaked too soon If the world is so green Then why does it scream under a blue moon We wonder why If the earth's sacrificed For the price of its greatest treasureWhen you think you've reached the end of the line Walls that once blocked your way Come tumbling down And you'll find the answers were there all the time When we turn out the lights and we sit in the dark Is the mountain too high to climb Halfway to heaven When you're flat on your back you can still see the stars Guiding you through the night Halfway to paradise Tin gods plan Life's doors slam To hold you back When you're born on the wrong side of the track Don't take no Take hold Don't leave it to chance You let the world roll by You're trying to hang yourself without a rope Mister dream - take control I am the means to reach your goal"

wait a sec When you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck Or I did last time I checked Not shy of a spark The knife twists

afraid to fall Cuz it ain't easier Waking up at dawn To find I lost my crown If I found you there With flowers in your hairYou're the shaded sun You're daddy's broken gun You're the loneliest moon You are a butterfly dreaming about your cocoon You're the only sound when I am blind So I label you mine You're the house you grew up in You're always just arriving at your end You're your mama's shit eatin' grin and your daddy's double chin You're the first pair of shoes you ever went to school in And you're the kid pretending she's in prison Behind the bars of a jungle gym Someone's gonna give you wings And you'll think it's what you need And you'll fly You'll be so high But you're history acts as your gravity Your history acts as your gravity Acts as your history acts as your gravity You're the only one you ever believe in You're the solution and you are the problem You're a rapist and your only victim You are fact and you are fiction You're the only one you've considered a friend And now you're alive Waiting for your life to begin AgainI don't know where we've been Could you tell me where we are again And Jesus is my only friend No one else knows who I am I know I'll never make it on the cross Spent my days looking for what my daddy lost He was too proud to have a boss Sold himself out then he couldn't afford the cost No one knows how he felt Hung himself in the county jail There were those who said he would burn in hell I don't think they knew him very well Angel of love Shine a light on us I was born to be Redemption's son Angel of love Shine a light on us I was born to be Redemption's sonThere are things we cannot know Invisible hands which guide the show from up above Sometimes you are forced to go Fall away and shut the door on the one you love Well I don't know now where you are Your photograph sits like a scar up against my wall Such a pretty face The sunshine in your eyes Taken on that day When all we had was love Shut the light on me Shut the light on me Now Jesus, he came down here just to die for all my sins I need him to come back here and die for me again Cause I cannot forgive myself for what it is I've done Avoiding your memory like a vampire does the sun And all I want's your love And all I want's your love Shut the light on me Shut the light on meI don't wanna hold you hostage I wanna set you free If I could I'd pay your ransom And give your eyes to see You know my love, it will follow If you only follow me Your eyes will open up so easily I don't wanna make you suffer Or fill you up with shame What I want is to protect you Give you shelter from the rain If you take my hand and maybe Even take my name We won't have anyone else left to blame See how the horses run Round the track Until the winner come Wait for the sound of his gun And then the horses run I guess I was only dreaming I'm here all on my own I remember how you left me Homeless in my home But you said I had it coming'Cause I've always done you wrong But I was finding out where I belongI'll be silent in my solitude Can't fight my smile Or my gratitude I'm afraid of what I might do'Cuz there's no me if there's no me and you I wish that I could open up your eyes To feel the sun that burns in your mind I can't deal with what you have done Reincarnate I wonder who I might become With the potential of a loaded gun I could be as fresh as hard bubblegum I don't have nothing now I want me some First some of you Then some of everyone Oh darling since you've been away from me I know how the pins feel In the bowling alley They say love is something you feel but never see When I see you I firmly disagree I'm just trying to be all that I can be Without destroying you now Or joining the army"

Assembly of Dust,adult alternative artists,10,"The second song came softly He heard it seeping through the vent The notes were long and languished They described their circumstance The rent was halfway spent The day was peeling hot She asked, ""Can we leave this place ""He answered, ""Probably not."" They had less than they guessed but more than they knew That second song was the best they could do And all of the while there were two: one eyed green and one eyed blue They came from somewhere simple A place too plain to be described She found her own dimensions Ran like the color of her eyes She looked with one eye green And one eye cobalt blue He looked right back at them And shivered through and through He heard his name ring hollow as it sputtered from her mouth He heard the door frame shudder as she shuttled from the house She left one green eyed child and one with cobalt blue He held them close at hand and wondered what he would doIn a small leafy town Slight North of slightly west Yeah Sat a babe with soft brown eyes And the man that they love best Yeah Well The world was rushing like a shot from a gun The vaulted sky shining blue for the Sun Love Anyone There was promise along the lake The air was cold and clear Yeah They were better, just for having been They were coupled by the years Yeah Well The world was rushing like a shot from a gun The vaulted sky shining blue for the Sun Love Any Love Any Love AnyoneCounting hours in a place that doesn't have a name There were thousands who were laid to waste But no one who could take his place No one who could take his place The Ohio River bank was soft beneath her weight As she walked from it her body sank No one's ever coming back No one's ever coming back They came a great distance in the driving snow And the last thing he heard was a trumpet blow Then the sky collapsed and the earth turned gray Paul Henry died today Paul Henry died today In Kentucky there's a town that doesn't have a name They all remember how it all went down The way their shoulders touched the ground The way their shoulders touched the ground They came a great distance in the driving snow And the last thing he heard was a trumpet blow Then the sky collapsed and the earth turned gray Paul Henry died today Paul Henry died todayI hope I find a noble death And avoid an angry trigger I guess I'll find my ripe old self Or at least that's what I figure The sour breath of a disappointed girl Daring the man who could keep her She was born by the name of Lynn But she went by Honey Creeper The bones of an old life call They tear at the threads of my innards Somewhere something went wrong Now I'm living with ghosts and with sinners It must have been 1929 When I took my turn to hold her I felt a longing that I couldn't quite express And by fault I never told her The bones of an old life call They tear at the threads of my innards Somewhere something went wrong Now I'm living with ghosts and with sinnersI went around my elbow to get to my ear Ever since I been listenin' I like what I hear Someone's on the back porch playin' on an old guitar I hear them calling The notes are falling I've been a stranger all my life I've been accused of stranger things I like the sound of Miss Etta James I like the way that she sings My mouth and eyes are circles My visions near but straight The silence curves it bends my nerves And it funnels me through my fate Someones on a cold street walking on a cobblestone I hear them walking I hear them talking Illusions die hard friend You best think again If you press the flesh friend The picture may bend Let the day instruct us let the veil prevail If you need it you best believe itWe are all fables We are all silhouettes in time We are all floating In the stars You are a stable In the acres of my life Your breath is mingling With mine I can all but hear The beating of your heart as it's rushing The sound is pounding and near Love can be crushing Jewel of my bloodstream In the lazy winter day Your eyes alight With sun shot rays Riot of color Is a banquet for your name The world's alight With coals aflame I can all but hear The beating of your heart as it's rushing The sound is pounding and near Love can be crushingThe cigarette case was silver and worn The clasp went soft, it didn't work no more Well the lid was bent;The smoke was spent Come back again -I'm gone These are the things of a painted past Details prevail When the paint don't last A soft summer breeze headed in the eaves Of an old pine house down on Ashland Street Where the crickets speak And wicker creaks Come back again -I'm gone These are the things of a painted past Details prevail When the paint don't last And the paint don't last Mary Kate was straight about one thing:The lines of our time can be simple and certain40 reasons why I often wonder Bought a girl who lead me on through the thunder and the rain Why don't you ever hold me I dont believe you told me40 reasons why I am singing My head is turning and my heart is stinging and You have got me on a string That kind of love can be a lonely thing Growing old gives people the blues but Growing older always gets you confused I been working and I sit for a while And my mind wanders to your distant smile I bend down to tie my shoe Lord knows right then that I am thinking of you I am listening to my favorite band And I am wishing I was holding your hand I keep hopin' that one day you'll see And you'll go looking for a man like me cause I am like a song without notes With out you, without you I am like a little boy without hope Without you, without you I am like the moon without the sun Dark and lonely cause your the only one Hear what I say I'm dark and lonely - I'm dark and grey I'm dark and lonely in and of the day I'm dark and lonely without youMake yourself at home we've been expecting you We've been waiting for you to arrive Black and white images circling you And tracking the light from your eyes Raising your high like the arc of the sun You have arrived you have begun Language is blue and lavender deeds And decades pass with dazzling speed The sun has come with blossom red clouds And almond shaped eyes from the sea Raising you high like the arc of the sun You have arrived you have begun You have just begun We've been expecting you You have just begun Shake from your ankles Summon your voice And introduce the trickle of time Everything's new and turning a fresh And everything is always divine Raising you high like the arc of the sun You have arrived you have begunI was a man with a plan and I landed in New York City I found a world that that unfurled an taught me the meaning of haste I found a well healed girl and I thought that she looked pretty I opened my heart to her and she read it on my face You mine as well as well accept the rest and not expect to prosper When your hiding from the sun Living fast the cold contrast fuels my fascination Like a breath before the plunge I took car to bar and ordered myself whisky You know it's my drink of choice and it fills me full of charm I know I've had too much when my head gets soft and dizzy But if you ask my wife she'd say it does more good than harm I came out of the park that day and I waivered in the place I stood Living deep in golden city in a way I never thought I could I came out of the park that day and saw it with my waking eyes My breath grew short and my heart rate quickened in response to my own surprise There was a fuss on the bus cause someone had got busted I got splashed as it passed and it clattered down the road I seen worse and I cursed and I swore there was no justice And that I'd leave this town before my heart grew old"

I suppose that's just the way it is Just to think This could be the last time I hold you Hold you ever again Oh, I don't think I'll ever sleep till morning'Cause he's the only one I've ever wanted Oh, and in my ears, my blood is just roaring'Cause he's the only one I've ever wanted I suppose that's just the way it isI first saw you like an old ghost story From my family tree that was handed down to me I've known you like a siren song that warns I have been informed you could be the death of me But patience pounds on the time that I stole You were meant to be mine I draw a duel with the cards of the gods That were played in fated time I know we'll meet again Maybe tonight Just tell me where and when I know it's never sure Maybe tonight Maybe tonight The sky whispers in a baritone That the mystery always beats what I am shown Search the dial for what I need to know They don't play those songs on my radio But patience pounds on the time that I stole You were meant to be mine I draw a duel with the cards of the gods That were played in fated timeSometimes I feel like I ruined everything Sometimes I feel like I’m slippin, slippin oh oh The way my brain and body, reacts to every memory Sometimes I feel like I’m slippim, slippin, oh oh I should’ve listened up when I was young But I always talked to much Punch drunk on some bad luck Hard times You gotta make mistakes to know It takes mistakes to grow And now I know I gotta listen up Oh listen up When life got real, when life got real I didn’t know if I could handle it Too many opinions I don’t wanna listen But when my brain and body holds onto every memory I need your help so please advise I should’ve listened up when I was young But I always talked to much Punch drunk on some bad luck Hard times You gotta make mistakes to know It takes mistakes to grow And now I know I gotta listen up Oh listen upOne way is up, one way is down Why am I waiting, waiting, waiting around I don't wanna play safe and sound When the world comes tumblin', tumblin' down Cuts me to the core Calm before the storm Tick, tick, tick, tock, time is up This message will self destruct Hey, hey, hey, hey, look out below Watch 'em fall like dominos I don't wanna play safe and sound When the world comes tumblin', tumblin' down Take me in your arms Keep sounding the alarm Tick, tick, tick, tock, time is up This message will self destruct Hey, hey, hey, hey, look out below Watch 'em fall like dominosThere's a million ways to leave your past To turn your eyes and watch it die Hometown hopes, they fade, they fade and change Just like a joke passed down in time Hiding out in alleyways And sleeping on the beaches in the summer We would try anything, anything just once If it seemed cool enough Everyone I've known that has turned cold When they felt old, their fear has stayed Hometown heroes fall as years go by Like dominoes, a dark parade I'll go anywhere I'll go anywhere you want, if you'll take me I know that I don't know you very well But you seem cool enough I don't care where you're going, you're taking me with you This place's got nothing that I could want But I think that someday I might feel different Feel that someday, oh, still that someday take me with youI am raising a flag, I am just too tired now to fight It's white and it's waving, can't we save this for another night I used to be afraid, but now I crave the quiet Together we are both alone, but I don't mind I'll dream of something to try and make us alright To make us alright Baby, put your arms down They're machines that can't be fixed no more'Cause when the alarm sounds I'll be right here waiting at your door We'll sit up on the bed for a while Together we are both alone, but we don't mind We'll dream of something to try and make us alright To make us alright, it's alright, it's alright To make us alright, it's alright, it's alright But the dawn is trouble When I close my eyes, you never go away I've tried everything, still you won't change Is it better if you go But the ending doesn't matter One hundred days and then the suffering stops Running faster through this Hope to save your heart before it drops And you can never say I didn't try Together we are both alone, but I don't mind I dreamt of everything, I tried to make us alrightMy, my, my, my past lives have got me weary I, I, I, tiptoe past so you can’t hear me You wake up in the middle of the night With your heart beating hard Knowing something isn’t right I’m sleepwalking Sleepwalking Around the world I used to dream in So much time has gone by but I’m still haunted To forgive and forget is all I wanted Past is past, I should leave it where it lies I can smile to your face but you can see it in my eyes I’m sleepwalking Sleepwalking Around the world I used to dream in Waiting to begin again Until then I’m sleepwalking I’m sleepwalking Sleepwalking Around the world I used to dream in Waiting to begin again Until then I’m sleepwalkingYou can't see me from this view All the way down Trailing the procession I'll hide out a few more days Then I'll be leaving this place soon Our hearts are singing out just for you A cemetery song for summer And if we knew just what we could do A cemetery song we'd not sing I'm sitting over Neptune City I used to love it It used to be pretty I'll come down, walk around a while Until I'm sure I can never go home again Maybe if I paid attention I could learn to love the landscape I was born to By the river in the rain Let it make me new again Our hearts are singing out just for you A cemetery song for summer And if we knew just what we could do A cemetery song we'd not sing"

don't pay to live like that So I cut the ties and I jumped the tracks For never to return Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in Are you aware the shape I'm in My hands, they shake, my head, it spins Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in When at first I learned to speak I used all my words to fight With him and her and you and me Oh, but it's just a waste of time It's such a waste of time That woman she's got eyes that shine Like a pair of stolen polished dimes She asked to dance I said it's fine I'll see you in the morning timeThere’s a darkness upon me that’s flooded in light In the fine print they tell me what’s wrong and what’s right And it comes in black and it comes in white And I’m frightened by those that don’t see it When nothing is owed or deserved or expected And your life doesn’t change by the man that’s elected If you’re loved by someone, you’re never rejected Decide what to be and go be it There was a dream and one day I could see it Like a bird in a cage I broke in and demanded that somebody free it And there was a kid with a head full of doubt So I’ll scream til I die and the last of those bad thoughts are finally out There’s a darkness upon you that’s flooded in light And in the fine print they tell you what’s wrong and what’s right And it flies by day and it flies by night And I’m frightened by those that don’t see it There was a dream and one day I could see it Like a bird in a cage I broke in and demanded that somebody free it And there was a kid with a head full of doubt So I’ll scream til I die and the last of those bad thoughts are finally outWhen my body won't hold me anymore And it finally lets me free Will I be ready When my feet won't walk another mile And my lips give their last kiss goodbye Will my hands be steady when I lay down my fears, my hopes, and my doubts The rings on my fingers, and the keys to my house With no hard feelings When the sun hangs low in the west And the light in my chest won't be kept held at bay any longer When the jealousy fades away And it's ash and dust for casual lust And it's just hallelujah And love in thoughts and love in the words Love in the songs they sing in the church And no hard feelings Lord knows they haven't done much good for anyone Kept me afraid and cold With so much to have and hold Mmm, hmmYou were a friend to me when my wheels were off the tracks And though you say there is no need I intend to pay you back When my mind was turning loose and all my thoughts were turning black You shined a light on me And I intend to pay you back But I still wake up, shaken by dreams And I hate to say it, but the way it seems Is that no one is fine Take the time, to peel a few layers And you will find True sadness When I was a child I depended on a bottle Full grown I've been known to lean on a bottle But you're the real deal in a world of imposters And I've seen the program make men out of monsters Cause I still wake up, shaken by dreams And I hate to say it, but the way it seems Is that no one is fine Take the time, to peel a few layers And you will find True sadnessThere ain't no man-can save me There ain't no man-can enslave me Ain't no man or men that can change the shape my soul is in There ain't nobody here who can cause me pain or raise my fear Cause I got only love to share If you're looking for truth I'm proof you'll find it there You got to serve something, ain't

The things that I think of No need to get over-alarmed I'm comin' home I wonder which brother is better Which one our parents love the most I sure did get in lots of trouble They seem to let the other go A tear fell from my father's eyes I wondered what my Dad would say He said, ""I love you and I'm proud of you both In so many different ways.""If I get murdered in the city Go read the letter in my desk Don't bother with all my belongings Pay attention to the list Make sure my sister knows I loved her Make sure my mother knows the same Always remember there was nothing worth sharing Like the

ride But this year is ours And maybe tomorrow We're gonna see Things we'd never believe I'll make you want me, you'll see The initial warning is free Only to reindeer Oh what a sight As they take their first flight Oh darling, it's all in time And I will, I will I will, I will I will, I will I will wait their return All made into the sky Oh what a sight, beautifulAnd you, were right to bide your time and not buy into my misery Well the good things are never free Do the colours of the rainbow look the same to everyone And I, was rushin' round in circles for a reason to believe Wipe the slime from of your sleeve You could follow me for weeks and i'm not goin' anywhere Sometimes it's hard to love someone Until the day that they are gone And I, just had a dream the other night I was married to the Queen And Madonna lived next door I think she took a shine to me And the kids were all grown up But I had to turn her down coz I was still in love with you I'm turnin' Madonna down I'm callin' it my best move I'll get a ticket to what you need I, remember doin' nothin' on the night Sinatra died And the night Jeff Buckley died And the night Kurt Cobain died And the night John Lennon died I remember I stayed up to watch the news with everyoneBeen feeling high And then feeling low Strap your hands across my engines I'm not broke so please don't mend me You're like a neon sign You just burn so bright Penetrates like an infection Give me feelings I can't mention Maybe all I need You need too Don't wait for me I'll wait for you I'm gonna follow you around I'm gonna wear you down I don't want to alienate you I got as long as it might take you Things come in ones And double up to twos Don't want to rain on your prossession Only seeking your obsession Maybe all I need You need too Don't wait for me I'll wait for youI'll leave you now In safe hands Cool your soul It's love still stands But failing that Just cool down Wouldn't you love to make it Is this real or am I just Imagining With wings take flight The rose of why And with that rose The case is closed But I need you now To help me somehow Well I'm scared to face it This final kiss But I know I'll remember it You gave your best to me Allow yourself to be FreeYou quiver like a candle on fire I'm putting you out Maybe tonight we could be the last shout And I'm fascinated by your style Your beauty will last for a while You're feeling instead of being The more that I live on the inside There's nothing to give I'm infatuated by your moves I've gotta search hard for your clues I want to repair your desire And call it a gift That I stole from just wanting to live Now I see the vision through your eyes Your innocence no longer fuels surprise Trying to outrun your fear You're running to lose Heart on your sleeve and your soul in your shoes Take a left A sharp left and another left Meet me on the corner, we'll start againI found a new remedy to defeat almost anything at all Is it true you tell me we're failing to see that we were dreaming of a lifestyle I can't believe that I fall for it every time The feelings ebb and flow like the tide But it's true what i would do if i were you Stop waiting for the summertime in wintertime Can't be right Don't subscribe to this jive Like waiting for the summertime in winter And if you turn up the dream to cure yourself free from searching for a new afterlife The purpose of life, you know there's still time to tune into the right side Well i assumed that we were lovers yesterday The turning tide when love has to pray You know what i would do if i were you Stop waiting for the summertime in wintertime Can't be right Don't subscribe to this jive Like waiting for the summertime in winterI'm a failure at heart But it seems I succeed When my heart feels the need To be helpful It doesn't happen much And as a result It's a rare thing Did I see you today Well if so I'd keep grace Cos I don't hold your face In my memory Everybody looks the same There's nothing else to blame But my, but my memory It's a craze no one knows Still I'm craving the days When this town was alive And amazing And for once I'm on time Still I'm falling around To the sights of this town'til they find meAnd well, I have to say If I don't know what I have to say If I could find a way Then I would find what I need to say Say something Say something that you mean Birds in the sky steal my melodies All I know is I don't now what this means But sometimes it's good To rearrange the orders of things Rubies and diamonds Rubies and diamonds Throw me to the lions Make me a man And if I had to wait for a time Where things fall into place If I could see your face Then it would change all I have to say Mean something Mean something that you say Birds in the sky sing my melodies And I don't know why I don't know what this means"

hurt you Didn't mean to do you wrong I guess I never learned to Cherish love 'til it was gone And then by chance to meet you Bringing back the memories I realised I need you Could you ever come on back to me Baby, baby, baby I know that we can make it Let me love you one more time One more chance to make it right I could make you change your mind Let me love you one more time Didn't know 'til I

ease your mind And all you needed was a just little of time Oh winter's passed, spring and fall You never wrote me, you never called Nathan Jones you've been gone too long Gone too long...If a woman could die of tears Nathan Jones, well, I wouldn't be here The key that you're holding won't fit my door And there's no room in my heart for you no more'Cause, winter's passed, spring and fall You never wrote me, you never called Nathan Jones you've been gone too long Gone too long Nathan Jones, Nathan Jones...Nathan Jones, ooh..Winter's passed, spring and fall You never wrote me, you never

they drove old Dixie down And the bells were ringing The night they drove old Dixie down And the people were singing They went, ""La, la, la"":Back with my wife in Tennessee When one day she called to me""Virgil, quick, come see, there goes Robert E.Lee""Now I don't mind choppin' wood And I don't care if the money's no good Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest But they should never have taken the very best The night they drove old Dixie down And the bells were ringing The night they drove old Dixie down And the people were singing They went, ""La, la, la""Thirty miles on the Gulf Stream I

I haven't smiled since yesterday If I need to I can pay But let me hold this 'til I feel okay Since you burned me at the stake All of my feelings went away There’s no feelings in my way At least there’s no feelings in my way I was there when you were blind to everything that I could see I'll pretend that it's just me But maybe really it's just me I forgot what it was like to think I found you finally What if you were the one for me I hope you weren't the one for me And I know this I can’t read it right, between the fights I still need you And I know this I fell for your eyes, I just realized I still need you I still need youSecond guess these words of mine I always thought that I'd be fine with you But ever since we crossed that line Got your green eyes in the back of my mind, it's true But I can't be just friends You're messin' with my head And I know what I said, but These feelings, they keep runnin' the red I got your heart on my mind and You said that I could come by anytime But I can't, I can't fall in love tonight I can't fall in love tonight I got your face on my mind and It was fun, runnin' around for a while But I can't, I can't fall in love tonight I can't fall in love tonight Two steps forward, one step back It won't be long 'fore my heart's attached And common sense falls second place To the way it feels when you kiss my face You were always searching for deliverance Blatant misconceptions that you make My overall perception of this dream Is that I'll die before I wake At another place in time You were infinitely mine Relatively alright When Berenstein was fine At another place in time Only parallel to mine The universe was alright When Berenstein was fine You were always certain that it did exist Imagination so intrinsic all at stake All the things we said when we were younger Did it bend or did I break At another place in time You were infinitely mine Relatively alright When Berenstein was fine At another place in time Only parallel to mine The universe was alright When Berenstein was fineCall it what you need But don't blame yourself for me Don't blame yourself for me'Cause I spaced myself from you'Cause I got tired of hurting you But now I'm hurting too Call it a rivalry, call it a fight Call it what you want, but I need you tonight Call it a waste of time or call it right But don't call it off, just call the black and white I call it how I see But you care way too much for me And I can't stand that honestly So I pushed it all away'Cause I won't let you see me this way But still, I'd wish you stay Call it a rivalry, call it a fight Call it what you want, but I need you tonight Call it a waste of time or call it right But don't call it off, just call the black and whiteI pulled in to Nazareth Was feeling 'bout half past dead I just need some place Where I can lay my head""Hey, mister, can you tell me Where a man might find a bed ""He just grinned and shook my hand And ""No"" was all he said Take a load off Fanny Take a load for free Take a load off Fanny And  you put the load right on me I picked up my bag I went looking for a place to hide When I saw Carmen and the Devil Walking side by side I said

beautiful start To a lifelong love letterI stick with real things Usually facts and figures When information's in its place I minimize the guessing game Guess what I don't like guessing games or when I feel things Before I know the feelings How am I supposed to operate if I'm just tossed around by fate Like on an unexpected date With a stranger who might talk too fast Or ask me questions about myself before I've decided that He can ask me questions about myself He might sit too close Or call the waiter by his first name Or eat Oreos But eat the cookie before the cream But what scares me the most...What scares me the most...Is what if when he sees me What if he doesn't like it What if he runs the other way and I can't hide from it What happens then if When he knows me He's only disappointed What if I give myself away to only get it given back I couldn't live with that So I'm just fine inside my shell-shaped mind This way I get the best view So when he sees me, I want him toLet it begin, let Adam in Step one, original sin Underneath the leaves, Adam found Eve Both of them found something sweet under the apple tree Then it was over, roads divide Step two, learning how to lie Let me ask a question to present day How the hell did Eve end up with all the damn blame All the damn blame To all the dirty looks, the kitty-cat calls To the ones who try and throw us up against the back walls Let me tell you something you'll understand:Only the little boys tell you they're a big man To all my sisters and all our friends We have to thank them, please Strength means blessed with an enemy All my, my, my, my armor comes from you You make me try, try, try, try harder Oh, that's all I ever do, ever do Oh, no no, my, my, my, my armor comes from you You make me stronger, stronger Now hand me my armorCome by the fire, lay down your head My love, I see you're growing tired So set the bad day by the bed And rest a while, your eyes can close You don’t have to do a thing but listen to me sing I know you miss the world, the one you knew The one where everything made sense Because you didn't know the truth, that's how it works’Til the bottom drops out and we learn We're all just hunters seeking solid ground Don't stop trying to find me here amidst the chaos Though I know it's blinding there's a way out Say out loud, we will not give up on love now No fear, don't you turn like Orpheus, just stay here Hold me in the dark and when the day appears We'll say we did not give up on love today I'll show you good, restore your faith I’ll try and somehow make a meaning of the poison in this place Convince you, love, don’t breathe it in You were written in the stars that we are swimming in And it has no name, no guarantee It's just the promise of a day I know that some may never see But that’s enough, if the bottom drops out I hope my love was someone else's solid groundBum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum Bum bum bum bum bum bum Bum bum bum bum bum bum This is my winter song to you The storm is coming soon It rolls in from the sea My voice: a beacon in the night My words will be your light To carry you to me Is love alive Is love alive Is love They say that things just cannot grow Beneath the winter snow Or so I have been told They say we're buried far Just like a distant star I simply cannot holdDoor clicks while his wheels start spinning on the pavement And I go fill the space up where he has been staying Won't lose much sleep, he never went that deep""Love you,"" oh, you sweet thing, no, I never said that Let me hold your ego while you get your bag packed Don't take this the wrong way But when the spade shows up, I call it by its first name We were, we were never gonna catch fire We'd've burned up in the flames Long before they ever rose up higher Someday, I, I won't have to feel the cold But I do now, so I'll know What it feels like when I feel fire, fire Mmm, fire Fire Talk, touch, kiss, then this one's just like all the others And I know all too well that I want deeper waters I held my breath to swim But shallow shores aren't safe enough to dive in"

about Just listening and re-listening to Smiley Smile And I'm wondering if this is some kind of creative drought Because I'mBroke into the old apartment This is where we used to live Broken glass, broke and hungry Broken hearts and broken bones This is where we used to live Why did you paint the walls Why did you clean the floor Why did you plaster over the hole I punched in the door This is where we used to live Why did you keep the mousetrap Why did you keep the dish rack These things used to be mine I guess they still are, I want 'em back Broke into the old apartment Forty-two steps from the street Crooked landing, crooked landlord Narrow laneway filled with crooks This is where we used to liveI met you before the fall of Rome And I begged you to let me take you home You were wrong, I was right You said goodbye, I said goodnight It's all been done It's all been done It's all been done before I knew you before the west was won And I heard you say the past was much more fun

same three chords Will you just yawn and say'Ah, I hate it'When I was born, they looked at me and said""What a good boy, what a smart boy, what a strong boy""And when you were born, they looked at you and said""What a good girl, what a smart girl, what a pretty girl""We've got these chains hanging around our necks People want to strangle us with them Before we take our first breath Afraid of

made amends I think It's the getting to the point that is the hardest part And if you call, I will answer And if you fall, I'll pick you up And if you court this disaster I'll point you home I'll point you home You think I only think about you when we're both in the same room I'm only here to witness the remains of love exhumed You think We're here to play a game of who loves more than whom

He was only 34  Always a fan of the resilient old guy, I was thrilled to see him bounce back with four more Cy Young awards and two World Series championships with the Yankees in the years that followed  It's too bad that those achievements have been tarnished by his connection with steroids  Then again, pride and the determination to prove the doubters wrong can sometimes cause you to take on some drastic and regrettable actions I work hard, I earn my pay, and I do the best I can  In Boston town it's sweat and blood that makes a man a man  But the years are cruel; they take their toll and they get you on the run  34 and the boss, he said my time here was done But it's all right, I'll carry on  I will persevere  They wished me well and they let me go in the twilight of my career Spent some time up in Canada before I was New York City bound  They got no time for losers in that big city town  So I took some chances, I bent some rules, and I made some ugly ties  The fountain of youth becomes a poisoned well when you fill it up with lies  But it's all right, I'll carry on  Now I'm in the clear  I had to prove them wrong, I guess, in the twilight of my career  In the twilight you'll do some things that you would never do again, but you were just a young man then…Now my time is done and no one dares to speak my name  Forgotten, a pariah, I'm a ghost that walks this game  I meant no wrong but wrong I've done  It's easy to forget -- you sell your soul piece by piece until there's nothing leftIf Bobby Ojeda hadn't raged at Sullivan and Yawkey And hadn't been traded to the Mets for Calvin Schiraldi If Oil Can Boyd hadn't been such a nut case And Jim Rice had twice taken an easy extra base If the Red Sox had had a better playoff 4th starter --Instead Nipper served up a big fat slider to Carter What would Seaver have done if not for his bum knee Would he have taken the ball and exacted revenge on his old team If Gooden had pitched like the real Dr  K Or Donnie Moore hadn't had that nightmare day That stuck with him till he couldn't take anymore And turned his own kitchen into a killing floor And John Mc Namara what the hell was he thinking Was it him, not the party boy Mets, doing all the drinking If he'd hit Baylor for Buckner and yanked the first baseman For his by-the-book late inning defensive replacement That ball would have been snagged And Mookie's last name wouldn't now be ""86""Bob Stanley picked a pretty bad time to uncork a wild pitch And I'm sure he's still thinking that you could have blocked it, Rich Then the tying run might have not been tallied by Mitch If one play killed the Sox, can you please tell me which I guess everything happens for some sort of reason And there must be a tragic end to every long season If even one man doesn't do one thing he does We'd all know Bill Buckner for just what he was:A pretty tough out for the Dodgers, Red Sox and Cubs Ten thousand at bats and close to three thousand hits And he stole plenty of bases before his legs quit As tough to walk as he was to strike out --But there's only one play that ever gets talked aboutCraig Finn: My love for the Minnesota Twins became even more passionate when I moved to N YC ten years ago  Reading the local coverage of all things Yankees made me realize that being a Twins fan is a blessing  The Twins don't win every year, or even every decade  They don't normally compete in the off-season arms race – they develop talent  Thus, when they do win I get to feel elation and bliss, and not just relief  In some way, it's like music; many of my all-time favorite bands aren't that great every night, but when it comes together it feels even sweeter  The one thing that's always bothered me is the nickname ""Twinkies""  Bad enough when other teams' fans call them that, but even Minnesotans are known to use that name  To me, that sounds soft, insubstantial, and it hurts  So please don't call them Twinkies In 1965 I wasn't quite alive yet, but I'm told they gave the M VP to Zoilo Versalles  Oliva hit the singles and Harmon hit the homers  Mudcat Grant won 20 games and they didn't play in a dome yet  The Dodgers came to Bloomington to play for the World Series  The Twins took the first two -- you can even ask Vin Scully  But Sandy Koufax proved to be a bit too much to crack, and the Twins went down in seven but they vowed that they'd be back From Nicollet to Hennepin, from St  Paul to St  Cloud, the Minnesota Twins are making Minnesotans proud  We don't buy our titles so the summers where we stay  These are grown men  These are heroes  Please don't call them Twinkies In the fall of 87 I was pretty much in heaven  I got my license and a girlfriend and the Twins had won the pennant  I prayed more in the Dome than I ever did at church  Kirby Puckett had the smile; Kent Hrbek had the smirk  First we tamed the Tigers, then we were dealt the Cards, and they came to the Twin Cities to try to make sense of our park  It was loud, and it was close, and it went to seven games  But the Twins took home the title and that sweet music played From Edina to Duluth, from the south side to downtown, the Minnesota Twins are making Minnesotans proud  So hey, let's make some noise  C'mon, wave those Homer Hankies  These are grown men  These are heroes  Please don't call them Twinkies In 1991 the Twins were once again on top  We faced Atlanta in the Series  They thought that they were hot  I've never seen nothing so lame as that Fondahawk chop  But we were up against the ropes when Kirby called his shot  And as he ran around the bases, smiling and pumping fists, we all knew that he had won it, though it was only just game six  And the next night Jack Morris came and made his hometown proud  You should watch it in slow motion: Ron Gant was clearly out From Mankato up to Brainerd, from Burnsville to Bemidji  Now we're playing outdoor baseball and that's the way it should be  Raise a toast to Kirby Puckett, raise another to Tom Kelly  These are Minnesota Twins  So please don't call them Twinkies  We've got Justin, we've got Joe  That's enough reason to party We don't buy our titles and we've still won two World Series  Grab yourself a 3.2 beer and raise a toast to Gardy  These are the Minnesota Twins  So please don't call them TwinkiesYo trabajo en Chavez Ravine donde mi gente perdieron sus casas vente anos pasado Y ahora todo el mundo me quiere pero nadie sabe lo que yo hablo despues del partido Fernando, Fernando Te necesitamos ahora Dicen que fue un mania, Fernandomania Y por que me quiere tanto cuando hoy no le gusta mi gente cuando no estan jugando el juego Americano Le gente dicen, ""devuelvense"" y por que cuando hemos vivido aqui por tantos anos Pero en '81 me quiere, me quiere y ahora que ha cambiado, quiero saberHe's a friend of the Smithereens, an old pal of Eddie Vedder For a good few years there weren't any pitchers better He loved R.E.M  and he played a Rickenbacker guitar But for a night on the town with Mike Mills, you get hit pretty hard Mike and I met up with Dennis Diken and Black Jack somewhere As this was New York City, you may have heard they have a few bars there Jack loved the Replacements, and we drank enough that we became them Two guitars, bass, and drums, yeah, our lineup was the same then He was crowned the Yankee Flipper by the foul ball of fame He gave 50,000 fans the finger, but we'd like to share a little bit of the blame It was Spike and Mike and Black Jack and me I'm told Jack ended up on the cold tiles of the floor With his mom, who was visiting, banging on the bathroom door Next time he took the mound was not a pretty sight And I've always figured it had a lot to do with that night The photos filled every front page of the morning editions Now he's the poster boy for a grand baseball tradition Templeton, Tejada, Billy Martin, and Albert Belle From old Hoss Radbourne all the way to David WellsFree agent Reggie Jackson shows up in 1977 on the New York Yankees, a team with no shortage of superstars or flamboyant hotshots  Is he humbled  Deferential  Silent but determined  Hardly -- our Reggie shows up and tells the newspapers that ""those other guys are fine but I'm the straw that stirs the drink."" If you're going to be that cocky, you had better have the goods to back it up  He did and the Yankees won their first World Series championship since the early '60s Everybody talks about the new kid in town  They talk behind his back when he's not around  I'd like to slip in but that's not my style  Let me see how you're feeling about me in a little while  The cities got their blackouts and their Son of Sam  There are superstars and then there's what I am  One of a kind -- they made the tabloids just for me  Look out now 'cause there's something that I want you to see I'm the straw that stirs the drink  I'm the straw, you don't even have to think about it  Because they're waiting outside the clubhouse door  Mr  October's got it coming and a little more The captain's a hero but he can't do what I can  The skipper's drunk and beating on the marshmallow man  My swing's so sweet they could name candy after me  Stick around until October and then we'll see  I'm a card carrying member of Mensa  I've got M VP trophies on my credenza  Go ask the Daily News, they'll tell you what I can do  Mr  October's got a little something for youThey don’t make ’em like they used to And it’s sure that they never will again Let it be said right now more than ever before That the Babe was a giant amongst men Oh, the Babe was a giant amongst men Home Run Baker never even dreamed of So many balls flying over a fence There can be no doubt, that the Babe changed the game More than anyone before or since The House That Ruth Built The Curse of the Bambino The Sultan of Swat The King of Swing In thousands of headlines In millions of hearts Babe Ruth was everything’Cause they don’t make ’em like they used to And it’s sure that they never will again Let it be said right now more than ever before That the Babe was a giant amongst men Oh, the Babe was a giant amongst men Did he sock three out for poor sick Johnny Sylvester At Wrigley Field, did he call his shot When you’re larger than legend, when you’re almost a God It doesn’t matter what is real and what is notTake me out to the ball game Take me out with the crowd Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack I don’t care if I never get back Let me root, root, root for the home team If they don’t win, it’s a shame For it’s one, two, three strikes, you’re out At the old ball game"

boté el cеlular De lo tóxico que erеs, se volvió perjudicial Lo que se va, se va Conmigo no te equivoques De lo tóxico que eres, no te quiero ver más Llegué pa'l party, saca la botella La que te quería, no sé quién es ella Te dejé el review, no te puse ni una estrella Y te olvidé porque no dejaste huella Ya no miro pa'trás, ni pa' parquearme Tengo a uno que está listo pa' llevarme El segundo está esperando en el hotel Y el tercero lo conozco esta noche No me llames, que mi número cambié Si quieres que te lo dé Llama 1-800-jódete No sé si me escuchaste No me llames, que mi número cambié Si quieres que te lo dé Llama 1-800-jódete "

come to me on a summer breeze Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave And it's me you need to show How deep is your love How deep is your love  How deep is your love I really mean to learn'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools Breakin' us down When they all should let us be We belong to you and me I believe in you You know the door to my very soul You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour You're my saviour when I fallWell, you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk The music loud and the women warm I've been kicked around since I was born And now it's alright, it's okay And you may look the other way But we can try to understand The New York Times' effect on man Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother You're stayin' alive,

doin' on your back  Hey You should be dancing, yeah Dancing, yeahOh, girl, I've known you very well I've seen you growing every day I never really looked before But now you take my breath away Suddenly you're in my life Part of everything I do You got me working day and night Just trying to keep a hold on you Here in your arms, I found my paradise My only chance for happiness And if I lose you now, I think I would die Oh, say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine We can take forever, just a minute at a time More than a woman More than a woman to me More than a woman More than a woman to me Oh, now there are stories old and true Of people so in love like you and me And I can see myself Let history repeat itself Reflecting how I feel for you Thinking 'bout those people then I know that in a thousand years I'd fall in love with you againThere's a light A certain kind of light That never shone on me I want my life to be lived with you Lived with you There's a way everybody say To do each and every little thing But what does it bring If I ain't got you, ain't got you  Hey babe You don't know what it's like, baby You don't know what it's like To love somebody To love somebody The way I love you In my brain I see your face again I know my frame of mind You ain't got to be so blind And I'm blind, so so sorrily blind I'm a man, can't you see What I am I live and I breathe for you But what good does it do If I ain't got you, ain't got  Hey babeI started a joke Which started the whole world crying But I didn't see That the joke was on me, oh no I started to cry Which started the whole world laughing Oh, if I'd only seen That the joke was on me I looked at the skies Running my hands over my eyes And I fell out of bed Hurting my head from things that I'd said'Til I finally died Which started the whole world living Oh, if I'd only seen That the joke was on me I looked at the skies Running my hands over my eyes And I fell out of bed Hurting my head from things that I'd saidListen to the ground There is movement all around There is something goin' down And I can feel it On the waves of the air There is dancin' out there If it's somethin' we can share We can steal it And that sweet city woman, she moves through the light Controlling my mind and my soul When you reach out for me, yeah, and the feelin' is right Gimme that night fever, night fever We know how to do it Gimme that night fever, night fever We know how to show it Here I am Prayin' for this moment to last Livin' on the music so fine Borne on the wind, makin' it mineNobody gets too much heaven no more It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line Nobody gets too much love anymore It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb Ooh, you and me, girl got a lot of love in store And it flows through you And it flows through me And I love you so much more Then my life, I can see beyond forever Everything we are will never die Love is such a beautiful thing Oh, you make my world a summer day Are you just a dream to fade away Nobody gets too much heaven no more It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line Nobody gets too much love anymore It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb You and me, girl, got a highway to the sky We can turn away From the night and day And the tears you had to cryHere I lie in a lost and lonely part of town Held in time in a world of tears, I slowly drown Going home, I just can't make it all alone I really should be holding you, holding you Loving you, loving you Tragedy When the feeling's gone, and you can't go on, It's tragedy When the morning cries and you don't know why, it's hard to bear With no one to love you, you're going nowhere Tragedy When you lose control, and you got no soul, it's tragedy When the morning cries and you don't know why, it's hard to bear With no one beside you, you're going nowhere Night and day, there's a burning down inside of me, aaah Burning love with a yearning that won't let me be Down I go, and I just can't take it all alone I really should be holding you, holding you Loving you, loving youSmile an everlasting smile A smile can bring you near to me Don't ever let me find you gone Cause that would bring a tear to me This world has lost its glory Let's start a brand new story Now my love, right now There'll be no other time And I can show you how, my love Talk in everlasting words And dedicate them all to me And I will give you all my life I'm here if you should call to me You think that I don't even mean A single word I say It's only words, and words are all I have To take your heart away"

couldn't help myself It was like a movie Watching her eyes read What I wrote made Sweet Louise Feel weak in her knees And I thought that everyone would know by now I've been alive long enough to know How things just get around And everybody probably thinks I'm crazyI drove a nail in the bottom of my walking boot So I wail every time I hit the floor I'm dragging and I'm bleeding I'm begging and I'm pleading Cause I thought you had another And you cannot have another lover I don't believe in loving with a ball and chain Cause I feel how it crippled me inside I thought you were a cheating I couldn't bear you leaving Now I know you didn't do it I need you to believe me When I say I didn't mean it I didn't mean it When I said I didn't mean it Baby, I didn't mean it So I accused you wrong

on And pretend to be a friend of mine Hey hey whenever you roll those eyes It gets me low sometimes When I forget about all the shit you deal I'm a pretty lucky guy Today I really realizeA long winter and a red hot summer I don't remember very much about that year What I recall is a fear of falling in love While I was I gave everything I had to my lover It's no wonder people felt that I disappeared And at the end of the day all I had for myself Was my own lonesome tears But I made her happy And did that gladly But oh, it don't mean a thing Yeah all that's over now Me and my sister went to Arizona Seeing our mom while she was fighting her disease And doing what everybody said she needed So she could come home And it was late in the night when I called you One in the morning right outside of a motel Just checking in to tell you I was scared And that I feltHe's been licking wounds Since he was young But never known where the knife's coming from Things just turn him blue And he don't know why He's been that way his whole life But he keeps on waiting As if life was waiting for him He's likely to use something He might just abuse something And he might lose his mind He might lose his will to try Oh, but he'll be feeling alright Yeah yeah Yeah yeah She's been dreaming of love Since she was nine But never finds who she wants for her life Now she's twenty-five And thinks she's getting old And maybe thinks she should just stop tryingI don't wanna move on But I don't wanna stay here And if my life is a line All I see are the angles And there's a fence around my yard Don't wanna go back in time And I'm afraid of the future Just wish that everything worked How I imagine it used to When you were happy just because When you were angry just because When everything was what it was When everything was what it was When everything was what it was When everything was what it was So if you're readin' my palm And you can see where I'm going You could be right or wrong For me it's better not knowingIf you wanna derail this train Bend away the track, say you love me back The way I love you No whistle blows And the rhythm slows down A train without a will, happy standing still A rusted wheel So come on, come on, come on and Go away, take away from me your love Because, because, because It's everything I could ever need My love, it's true'Cause I don't I don't I don't want you To be just waiting at the station At my destination looking for me What keeps me rolling, rolling in locomotion Is chasing a dream, blowing out steam to look for you So come on, come on, come on and Go away, take away from me your love Because, because, because It's everything I could ever need Come on, come on, come on and Go away, take away from me your love Because, because, because It's everything I could ever need My love, you see'Cause I never, never wanted to beMy old home with flowers on all the tables Where did all that go I guess the flowers got old and died Wilted and dried from the son who was never that able To sit with you while you cried Now he's the one who's alone Yeah I'm trying Yeah I'm trying real hard Trying to build this thing back up from nothing But I'm shooting in the dark Keep on missing the mark, yeah But there's no doubt in my mind that I feel something Deep in my heart Hot on my head, yeah We are growin' older and bolder Trying to find the thread that connects our hearts Stretches so damn far, forget we're apart But now I got my head, said I'm tryin' to correct My growing list of wrongs And I'm surprised how it got this long And yeah I was a child but that don't cut it anymore Not like we're playing on any little swing set Is the world that's spinning 'round We get stuck to the ground, yeah But when we said that we could go higher Yeah I believed that And I feel it coming on It's why I wrote this song, yeah"

Blessid Union of Souls,adult alternative artists,10,"She don't care about my car And she don't care about my money And that's real good 'cause I don't got a lot to spend But if I did, it wouldn't mean nothing She likes me for me Not because I look like Tyson Beckford With the charm of Robert Redford Oozing out my ears But what she sees Are my faults and indecisions My insecure conditions And the tears upon the pillow that I shed She don't care about my big screen Or my collection of D VD's Things like that just never mattered much to her Plus she don't watch too much T VAnd she don't care that I can fly her To places she ain't never been But if she really wants to go I think deep down she knows that All she has to say is whenBrother, my brother Tell me what are we fighting for We've got to end this war We should love one another Oh can't we just pretend This war never began We can try, brother, my brother We face each other from different sides The anger burns, can't remember why It's kinda crazy to cause such pain Our foolish pride makes us hate this way We watch our world fall apart Tell me what good is winning When we lose our heart Brother My Brother Tell me what are we fighting for Isn't life worth so much more We should love one another Oh can't we just pretend This war never began Tell me why, brother my brother We can try, brother my brotherI knew that this moment would come in time That I'd have to let go and watch you fly I know you're coming back so why am I dying inside Are you searching for words that you can't find Trying to hide your emotions but eyes don't lie Guess there's no easy way to say goodbye Chorus:I'll be standing at the edge of the earth Hoping that someday you'll come back again I'll be standing at the edge of the earth hoping for someday Someday Don't misunderstand what I'm trying to say I don't want to let you leave this way I want you to know that I'll stand right by your side And I know this may be The very last time that we see each other cry Whatever happens know that I'll...Chorus:I'll be standing at the edge of the earth Hoping that one day you'll come back again I'll be standing at the edge of the earth Hoping that someday you'll come back to me I'll be praying for whatever its worth Believing that one day you'll come back again I'll be standing at the edge of the earth Hoping for somedayWalk blindly to the light and reach out for his hand Don't ask any questions and don't try to understand Open up your mind and then open up your heart And you will see that you and me aren't very far apart'Cause I believe that love is the answer I believe that love will find the way Violence is spread worldwide and there's families on-the street And we sell drugs to children now oh why can't we just see That all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do today Money is our incentive now so that makes it okay But I believe that love is the answer I believe that love will find the way I believe that love is the answer I believe that love will find the way Ooooh I've been seeing Lisa now for a little over a year She said she's never been so happy but Lisa lives in fear That one day daddy's gonna find out she's in love With a nigga from the streets Oh how he would lose it then but she's still here with me'Cause she believes that love will see it through And one day he'll understand And he'll see me as a person and not just a black manSeems like yesterday, but years have passed us by Precious memories are clear before my eyes I can hear your voice calling out my name But I don't know you now, nothing stays the same And All along I have wanted you I pray tonight that you want me too All along there was no one else I've been waiting here all by myself If you were here with me, ride the ocean tide To that special place I held for you, deep inside I've kept good company since you've been away Lonely stayed with me, and pride began to fade And All along I have wanted you, I've wanted you I pray tonight that you want me too ooh All along there was no one else I've been waiting here all by myself All by myselfI can't remember the last time that we kissed goodbye All our ""I love you""s were just not enough to survive Something your eyes never told me But it's only now too plain to see Brilliant disguise when you hold me And I'm free I've been thinking and here's what I've come to conclude Sometimes the distance is more than two people can use But how could I have known girl It was time and not space you would need Darling tonight I could hold you and you would know But would you believe There's a light in your eyes that I used to see There's a place in your heart where I used to be Was I wrong to assume that you were waiting for me There's a light in your eyes Did you leave that light burning for me Cards and phone calls and photograph pictures of you Constant reminder of all the things you get used to Is there a chance in Hell or Heaven That there's still something here to build on Or do you just pick up the pieces after they fall But after allWay over yonder Is a place that I know Where I can find shelter From hunger and cold And the sweet tasting good life Is so easily found Way over yonder That's where I'm bound I know when I get there The first thing I'll see Is the sun shining golden Shining right down on me Then trouble's gonna lose me Worry leave me behind And I'll stand up proudly In true peace of mind Talkin' bout a, talkin' bout a...Way over yonder Is a place I have seen In a garden of wisdom From some long ago dream May be tomorrow I'll find my way To the land where the honey runs In rivers each day And the sweet tasting good life Is so easily found Way over yonder - that's where I'm bound Way over yonder - that's where I'm boundAmy woulda died for me She woulda had my baby If I needed a favor, it was yes She never said maybe And all the times we walked barefoot in the sand Somehow we never felt the rain Now I got nothin' but time She's got her life and now I've got Nothing but mine I could walk off the hurt, run through the pain Wipe all the tears pouring down my face Deny the dream that just never was Oh, girl I just can't walk off the buzz Amy used to call me all the time But she hasn't lately I wonder if she goes out at all And if she's dating And every time I walk alone along the beach Somehow I always feel the rain So many times I wished for my space Now I wish I didn't feel so out of place I could walk off the feel, crawl through the hate Beg you to forgive my every mistake Pretend you and I just never was Oh, girl I just can't walk off this buzzI know you've heard the excuses before So I won't waste your time and I'll keep this short I've bound my emotions cause I can't afford to be wrong I know we've talked about being good friends So we've been real careful of the signals we've sent But all of your glances they came and they Went to my head And I'm not a man to throw words to the wind When I said ""I loved you"" that's what I meant And I plan to show you if it take me the Rest of my life The rest of my life Rest of my life I don't want to rush this cause my greatest fear Is taking for granted what's taken us years To build from the ground up with all of the tears that we've cried We've taken our time and for this I'm so glad Now we can be sure that this moment will last We've traveled a road of mistakes In our past to get here And I'm not about to throw words to the wind When I said ""I love you"" that's what I meant And I'm going to show you if it takes me The rest of my life The rest of my life The rest of my lifeHere we are we're on this ride to nowhere On this road to somewhere we have never been before We'll be all right As long as we're together We're like the little people from the little places All together searching for that bigger constellation You know we're all right As long as we're together What a union we could be if we just had the power What a moment we could seize in our finest hour Everything in time happens in this light Though our hands are tied We will still survive Well here we are and we've climbed the mountain Now we've seen the river but there's poison in the water Say it's all right If we just drink together Well we've seen the road and we've seen the signs Still we march in single file like cattle to the slaughter Yes it's all right As long as we're together"

now Every ship must sail away Well the morning was wrapped in a blanket of clouds I've been out driving since a quarter of two My body's aching, my feelings are numb From the bittersweet memory that's tangled in you The bittersweet memory all tangled in you There's cars that are cruising with nowhere to go And the rain in the streets makes them shine good as new Wish I could ride right out of this town And away from the memory that's tangled in you The bittersweet memory all tangled in you There's friends I go out with, friends that I know They leave the feels like there's nothing to do My best friend just packed up and left with her lover Left me alone with the memory of you Bittersweet memory all tangled in you So I'm packing my things and I'm moving back home This town ain't enough to cripple my soul Saying goodbye should be easy to do But the bittersweet memory is tangled in you A bittersweet memory's all tangled in you Well the morning was wrapped in a blanket of clouds I've been out driving since a quarter of twoToday I walked across the great divide And left you standing On the other side The things I loved in you were gone I'm seeing through you Monday night and here I am all alone Nothing you could say to me would Break my bones Your time has come and gone And vanished in the air I'm seeing through you I'm seeing through you I'm seeing through you I'm seeing through you And you are not the same It hurts my eyes to see the change I'm seeing through you I'm seeing through you Today I walked across the great divide And left you standing On the other side Your time has come and gone And vanished in the air I'm seeing through youI've been high and i've been low I've been wandering 'round the city of New Orleans Summer nights on crowded streets I've been tearing down the walls around my heart Fools cannot deny All the things you touch inside And like the daylight needs the sun Girl, you and me were made to run Left behind a trail of love in the shadows on the wall above your bed Nothing but a quarter moon and a halo making stars around your head Fools could not deny All the things you touch inside And like the daylight needs the sun Girl, you and me were made to run It's like the song that's in your head...It's like the song that's in your head...You are the song in my head that I find Was the song I was singing all along Driving fast, tracing lines in the dust around the memory of your love Far away, sleeping sound, waiting for my headlights in the driveIm walking the streets With my hands in my shoes Im out on a date with a picture of you I got a boxcar racer Its faster than the speed of sound It takes me away from here Shes walking the streets With her hands in her shoes And shes in love with a boy Who only gives her the blues She loves a boxcar racer because Hes faster than the speed of sound He takes her away from here And if you look oh if you look You'll find nothing at all You'll find nothing at all But if its good oh if its good You find a love a great lover If you let it go So now im walking the streets All alone in the night I take a look at myself And kiss you goodbye but why I was a boxcar racer who was driving so Fast that i couldn't slow down I was running away from here I was a boxcar racer who was driving so Fast that i couldn't slow down I was running away from here"

Blue Rodeo,adult alternative artists,10,"One One, two, one, two, three, four They met in a hurricane Standing in the shelter out of the rain She tucked a note into his hand Later on, they took his car Drove on down where the beaches are He wrote her name in the sand Never even let go of her hand Somehow they stayed that way For those five days in May Made all the stars around them shine Funny how you can look in vain Livin' on nerves and such sweet pain A loneliness that cuts so fine Find the face you've seen a thousand times Sometimes the world begins To set you up on your feet again And I know it wipes the tears from your eyes How will you ever know The way that circumstances go Always gonna hit you by surprise But I know my past You were there In everything I've done You are the oneYou say that you're leaving Well, that comes as no surprise Still, I kinda like this feeling Of being left behind This ain't nothing new to me Well, it's just like going home It's kinda like those sunsets That leave you feeling so stoned Hey, hey, I guess it hasn't hit me yet I fell through this crack and I kinda lost my head I stand transfixed before this streetlight Watching the snow fall on this cold December night Never thought this could happen But somehow the feeling's gone You got sick of the pattern And I got lost in this song Hey, hey, I guess it hasn't hit me yet I fell through this crack and I kinda lost my head I stand transfixed before this streetlight Watching the snow fall on this cold December nightStrange and beautiful are the stars tonight That dance around your head In your eyes, I see that perfect world I hope that doesn't sound too weird And I want all the world to know That your love's all I need All that I need And if we're lost Then we are lost together Yeah, if we're lost We are lost together I stand before this faceless crowd And I wonder why I bother So much controlled by so few Stumbling from one disaster to another I've heard it all so many times before It's all a dream to me now A dream to me nowHey, it's me what a big surprise Calling you up from a restaurant 'round the bend Just got in from way up North I'm achin' tired now, and I could use a friend I might be a fool To think that you do Wanna see me again I know it's been a while since I talked to you Nothing wrong, just nothing ever goes as planned Many times I thought I'd call I didn't have your number in my hand I know it's true That you'd never do The same thing to me I never meant to make you cry And though I know I shouldn't call It just reminds us of the cost Oh, of everything we've lost Bad timing that's all And maybe soon there'll come a day When no more tears will fall We each forgive a little bit And we both look back on it As just bad timing that's allDon't tell me I'm wrong'Cause I've been watching every move that you make Hearts you steal, in your makeup and heels Trouble for the men that you take Every time you walk in the room I couldn't ever be sure of a smile You were never the same way twice I'm falling in love Oh, night after night Oh, it's crazy, ooh So many people who said, ooh Girl, you've got nothing but time Oh, you are a shining star Don't worry what you’re leaving behind Every time you walk in the room I couldn't ever be sure of a smile You were never the same way twice I'm falling in love Oh, night after night Oh, it's crazyI want to know where my confidence went One day it all disappeared And I'm lying in a hotel room miles away Voices next door in my ear Well, daytime's a drag, nighttime's worse Hope that I can get home soon But the half-finished bottles of inspiration Lie like ghosts in my room Well, I wanna go I know I can't stay But I don't want to run feeling this way'Til I am myself'Til I am myself'Til I am myself again There's a seat on the corner I keep every night Wait 'til the evening begins I feel like a stranger from another world But at least I'm living again There are nights full of anger Words that are thrown Tempers that are shattered and thin But the moments of magic are just too short They're over before they beginSun breaks I can't wait'Til I'll be on my way again I'm sick and tired of waiting With nothing to do Watching the rain through a crack in the window It's the little things that get you through Like the same sun rising on me Is rising over you Walking and talking Like birds in the sky You tell your secrets How gracefully you lie That's the way you come to me I'm head over heels And I'm always gonna be That's okay, I love the way you come to me I guess we're tempting fate A little too long it seems Walking this heat Is just like floating in a dream I've been torn apart put back together With a couple of pieces in wrong I'm holding up now But I won't be for longI hear you talking everywhere Words on the loudspeakers Hanging in the air Everywhere And I remember the words You told me too This town's full of losers Trying to get a piece of you You really think that's true How long will it take'Til you open up your eyes I've been gone for years You never even realised How long How long In a corner of the world on election day You watched your star shatter Then fade away Too many wasted days With your eyes wide open a hand on the wheel You looked back hard trying to Remember just how it feels How does it feelI met this girl, she was walking through one of my dreams She kissed my eyes And everything that she said made so much sense to me That I still feel like I'm half asleep My dark angel, she gave me diamonds for eyes She walked by, ow I'm hypnotised By this dream that just won't stop And I feel like I've always been lost in this dream The rumours of heaven only speak the truth on earth My dark angel, shine your light on my curse You are the other that I have to find Until I do, I guess I'll see you 'round my mind So Colorado is a place I have to go I heard a rumour she loves the mountains and the snow My dark angel, she gave me diamonds for eyes My dark angel, I offer you my heart My dark angel, I think I loved you from the startWhat is this love that I leave behind How can I turn from the tears in your eyes What is this world where we always pretend That it is worth it, worth it in the end What is this life we share that I just throw away Is this love that causes so much pain What is the promise that I leave behind Why can't I just lie beside you again What's goin' on How'd it get so wrong What's goin' on How'd it get so wrong What is this dream that I'll never find What is this prayer that's stealing my mind What is this deal that I've just made with fate And I wonder if I have left it too late"
Blues Traveler,adult alternative artists,10,"Oh, once upon a midnight dearie I woke with something in my head I couldn't escape the memory Of a phone call and of what you said Like a game show contestant with a parting gift I could not believe my eyes When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend Who needs to humor me and tell me lies Yeah, humor me and tell me lies And I'll lie too and say I don't mind And as we seek, so shall we find And when you're feeling open, I'll still be here But not without a certain degree of fear Of what will be with you and me I still can see things hopefully But you Why you wanna give me a run-around Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up When all it does is slow me down And shake me and my confidence'Bout a great many things But I've been there, I can see it cower Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings Of a bad play where the heroes are right And nobody thinks or expects too much And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights Singing, ""Hey babe, let's keep in touch Hey baby, let's keep in touch""But I want more than a touch, I want you to reach me And show me all the things no one else can see So what you feel becomes mine as well And soon if we're lucky, we'd be unable to tell What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line But you Why you wanna give me a run-around Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up When all it does is slow me down Ha la la la, bombardier, this is the pilot speaking And I got some news for you It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop And there ain't a whole lot that you can do Oh sure, the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder Perhaps I've grown a little cynical But I know no matter what the waitress brings I shall drink in and always be full Yeah, I will drink in and always be fullIt doesn't matter what I say So long as I sing with inflection That makes you feel I'll convey Some inner truth or vast reflection But I've said nothing so far And I can keep it up for as long as it takes And it don't matter who you are If I'm doing my job, it's your resolve that breaks Because the Hook brings you back I ain't tellin' you no lie The Hook brings you back On that you can rely There is something amiss I am being insincere In fact I don't mean any of this Still my confession draws you near To confuse the issue I'll refer To familiar heroes from long ago No matter how much Peter loved her What made the Pan refuse to growI lied and told her I loved her She didn't care, but anyway I told her we'd still be friends And she didn't care, but anyway I tried last week for to call her She wasn't home, but anyway I think I'll spend my life alone I really don't care right now, but anyway It's a state of affairs and a state of emotions The kind of thing that you must understand I tell you one thing; you tell me another We walk away, maybe then shake hands I'm quitting cigarette smoking It's bad for me, but anyway I don't think the T V was joking When it told me this, but anyway The newsman said not to sit on strange toilet seats It's my life he's trying to save, but anyway I found out that I've got eye cancer Too many television waves, but anyway It's a state of affairs and a state of emotions The kind of thing that you must understand I tell you one thing; you tell me another We walk away, maybe then shake handsYou'll get no answer from me About what I want or what I get Brave enough to speak, afraid to see Confuse the issue till you forget And I've tried To finally decide Why I'm in your face And if you can't already tell I am unable to let things go I'm told I do it very well But more important you should know That all the same You've got no one to blame But yourself If you call that a waste‘Cause it ain't me That's been hurting you inside And if you've learned You'll know much more than I That you're gonna have to go and find it I could dig beneath the ground You'll have to unearth every ugly stone That kept you on your own And simply put them down You're gonna have to look aroundA chance again to diatribe You'll go along if you've imbibed My mannered tones of dire cost And if something gets translated lost Again I seek to hide the same As though we've never stopped our game And all the tidings I could bring Have never really changed a thing Dependent on each other, we Kept infinite the you and me That never really set us free Or too lonely was the place we'd be But for all I've ever tried to tell you I just couldn't seem to say how much I care And speaking as the aspect that befell you You've come to mean my universe out there For all the right or wrong I'd done I had to share it with someone The true, the lie, the in between Their implications, what they mean A troubled tale or trophied turn Within my heart, they'd only burn'Til the echoes on the acetate Reveal what we can all relate Then freely we can share our pain And know that we are not insane Or at least a frenzy we can own It's enough for me, I'm not aloneIf ever you are feeling like you’re tired And all your uphill struggles leave you headed downhill If you realize your wildest dreams can hurt you And your appetite for pain is drinkin’ its fill I ask of you a very simple question Did you think for one minute that you are alone And is your suffering a privilege you share only Or did you think that everybody else feels completely at home Just wait Just wait Just wait And it will come If you think I’ve given up on you, you’re crazy And if you think I don’t love you well then you’re just wrong In time you just might take to feeling better Time is the beauty of the road being long I know that now you feel no consolation But maybe if I told you and informed you out loud I say this without fear of hesitation I can honestly tell you that you make me proud Just wait Just wait Just wait And it will come Just wait Just wait Just wait And it will come It’s comin’ onI said ""I love you""She began to cry She said she needed a friend I said ""I'll try""Soon we'd say nothing Somehow I never wondered why You see, she left me She left me I'm alone I'm alone I'm alone I'm alone I'd loved her always She didn't know I tried patience Let a friendship grow I tried to keep her That's what made her go You see, she left me She left me I'm alone I'm alone I'm alone I'm aloneStand Stand and walk Tragedy Is cheap and so is talk Decision Yours to make, what will you do In the end It comes back to you‘Cause it's a long way to fall Thunder Don't scare me at all Lightning Well just a little Pressure It ain't worth a dime And your wounds They'll all heal in time‘Cause it's a long way to fall The answers are getting harder The answers are getting harder The answers are getting harder The answers are getting harder The answers are getting harderDon't you give up, don't allow disaster Don't you give up, don't you let her win We're talking about a ""forever after""Don't you give up, don't you dare give in Don't you give up, don't you dare give in Doesn't it seem most precarious Doesn't it seem such a chance to take Doesn't it seem most precarious Why does it feel like a big mistake Please understand and hear what I'm saying The time is now and you don't have long She could be oceans away tomorrow So soon your chance will have come and gone So soon your chance will have come and gone Doesn't it seem most precarious Doesn't it seem such a chance to take Doesn't it seem most precarious Why does it feel like a big mistake The tight-wire’s strung and you're out in the middle All eyes upon you, no net below Inches to go and you're almost home free Feel the wires swinging to and fro Feel the wires swinging to and froHear the drivers of the window When you listen to cars Mad accelerations Showing who they are Urgency in their aggression As they fight to make it home Loud in their confessional It's an endless conversation Rumbling out across the land Accelerated nation Put a wheel in every hand White line was a fever Now it's spread the whole world wide Each private true believer Come together to collide In every tree, there is a forest Every bee, there is a hive Every universe before us Unmistakably alive When you factor in survival Selfishly, you'll see the sun It's just the dream of one arrival Making all the engines run"

want to let go of the things that keep me warm Without you, I’m just cold I built a little boat With a sail from the memories I’ve been collecting And I’ll hold out For the wind to blow me, take me

it's not me Those three wise men They've got a semi by the sea Gotta ask yourself the question Where are you now Gotta ask yourself the question Where are you now Really sorry now, they weren't to

you breathing for the last time A song for your heart, but when it is quiet I know what it means and I'll carry you home I'll carry you home If she had wings she would fly away And another day God will give her some Trouble is the only way is down Down, down As strong as you were, tender you go I'm watching you breathing for the last time A song for your heart, but when it is quiet I know what it means and I'll carry you home I'll carry you homeBeautiful dawn Lights up the shore for me There is nothing else in the world I'd rather wake up and see with you Beautiful dawn I'm just chasing time again Thought I would die a lonely man In endless night But now I'm high Running wild among all the stars above Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me Beautiful dawn Melts with the stars again Do you remember the day when my journey began Will you remember the end of time Beautiful dawn You're just blowing my mind again Thought I was born to endless night, until you shineIt's a little after midnight There's a couple in the corner And I wonder what he said because she's crying And I guess they won't remember When they wake up in the morning With the headache from the whiskey and the wine I know that I have said things I regret when I am sober'Cause we always hurt the ones we love the most I messed up and I know it, if I hurt you girl I'm sorry But it's good to see the girl I used to know We could dance but I can't dance Maybe we could stick to holding hands Or should we raise a glass And forget the past If we keep on drinking we gon' fall back in love So fill it up, fill it up We must not be thinking 'cause we can't get enough So fill it up, fill it up Bartender, can you pour some love Bartender, can you pour some love "

Bon Iver,adult alternative artists,10,"Come on, skinny love, just last the year Pour a little salt, we were never here My my my, my my my, my my Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer I tell my love to wreck it all Cut out all the ropes and let me fall My my my, my my my, my my Right in this moment, this order's tall And I told you to be patient And I told you to be fine And I told you to be balanced And I told you to be kind And in the morning I'll be with you But it will be a different kind And I'll be holding all the tickets And you'll be owning all the fines Come on, skinny love, what happened here Suckle on the hope in light brassieres My my my, my my my, my my Sullen load is full, so slow on the split""Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me""You're laying waste to Halloween You fucked it, friend, it's on its head, it struck the street You're in Milwaukee, off your feet And at once, I knew I was not magnificent Strayed above the highway aisle Jagged vacance, thick with ice I could see for miles, miles, miles Third and Lake, it burnt away, the hallway Was where we learned to celebrate Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me That night you played me ""Lip Parade""Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree Saying nothing, that's enough for me And at once, I knew I was not magnificentDown along the creek I remember something Her, the heron hurried away When first I breeched that last Sunday Low moon don the yellow road I remember something That leaving wasn't easing all that heaving in my vines And as certain it is evening 'at is N OW is not the time Toiling with your blood I remember something In B, un—rationed kissing on a night second to last Finding both your hands as second sun came past the glass And oh, I know it felt right and I had you in my grasp Oh then, how we gonna cry Cause it once might not mean something And love at second glance, it is not something that we'll need Honey, understand that I have been left here in the reeds But all I'm trying to do is get my feet out from the creaseThis my excavation and to––day is Kumran Everything that happens is from now on This is pouring rain, this is paralyzed I keep throwing it down, two––hundred at a time And it's hard to find it when you knew it When your money's gone and you're drunk as hell On your back with the racks as the stacks of your load In the back with the racks and the stacks are your load In the back with the racks and you're unstacking your load I've been twisting to the sun I needed to replace And the fountain in the front yard is rusted out All my love was down in a frozen ground There's a black crow sitting across from me His wiry legs are crossed And he's dangling my keys, he even fakes a toss Whatever could it be that has brought me to this loss Up with your turret Aren't we just terrified Shale, screen your worry From what you won't ever find Don't let it fool you Don't let it fool you Down Dancing around Folds in her gown Sea and the rock below Cocked to the undertow Bones, blood, and teeth erode With every crashing node Wings wouldn't help you Wings wouldn't help you Down Down fills the ground Gravity's proudIs the company stalling We had what we wanted: your eyes With no word from the former I'd be happy as hell if you stayed for tea This is how we grow now, woman A child ignored These will just be places to me now The foreman is down We're rising the stairs​I find God And religion, too...Staying at the Ace Hotel If the calm would allow Then I would just be floating to you now It would make me pass to let it pass on I'm climbing the dash, that skinSo apropos Saw death on a sunny snow For every life Forgo the parable Seek the light My knees are cold Running home, running home Running home, running home Go find another lover To bring a To string along With all your lies You're still very lovable I toured the light So many foreign roads For Emma, forever agoPhilosophize your figure What I have and haven't held You called and I came, stayed tall through it all Fall and fixture just the same thing Say nothing of my fable, no What on earth is left to come Who's agonized and gnawed through it all I'm underneath your tongue I'm standing in your street now, no And I carry his guitar And I can't recall it lightly at all But I know I'm going in Too much for me to pick up, no Not sure what forgiveness is We've galvanized the squall of it all I can leave behind the harbour I will run Have to crawl Along the fires One more time just pass me by I'mma make it half the night Hall light wishesI am my mother's only one It's enough I wear my garment so it shows Now you know Only love is all maroon Gluey feathers on a flume Sky is womb and she's the moon I am my mother on the wall With us all I move in water, shore to shore Nothing's more Only love is all maroon Lapping lakes like leery loons Leaving rope burns, reddish rouge Only love is all maroon Gluey feathers on a flume Sky is womb and she's the moonSharing smoke In the stair up off the hot car lot Sun shine hard on the video spot Hm, mm, mm, mm Sure as any living dream It's not all then what it seems And the whole thing's hauled away A womb An empty robe Enough You're rolling up You're holding it You're fabric now Paramind Paramind Hallucinating Claire Nor the snow shoe light or the autumns Threw the meaning out the door There's no meaning anymore"

Boy & Bear,adult alternative artists,10,"Hey boy, now, what you making Looking up as you go I heard your voice just the other day, on the radio But like an ancient shrine that has swallowed your mind Well, you lost yourself with nothing to say I'd not the heart to ask you to stay Sweet times, all made up in my mind Where'd you go Where'd you go Where'd you go Where'd you go I know that wonder couldn't wake you From a slumber so slow Hazy Jane, well you known my name for a while now And all that wasted time following dotted lines Is enough to send a man insane I'd not the heart to ask you to stay Sweet times, all made up in my mind Where'd you go Where'd you go Where'd you go Where'd you go In all you've seen, what was it that came down on me that night A conjuring; I held on to that moment and lie just to make it alive I stood out there in the covering In the baskings of a holy night And I was lucid and conscious And hovering like a firefly My mind stretched out on the canopy It put its arms out slow And I heard the whispers of silence Floating down from the radio So come on, come on, I'm ready now I got that feeling, honey, like I'm ready to roll You see, I'm not gonna wait till the end of me'Cause I got the burning fire in the bed of my soul I saw the light from a kettle gun Sixteen days under a southern sun And there were times when I thought that I wouldn't mind it if I lost my mind out there You wouldn't believe me if I told you so The things I saw, were enough to make the man in me a man of me Mm, make a man of me...So come on, come on, I'm ready now Go get your things out, honey, let's get ready to roll Oh, I can feel a wave coming over me I've been waiting for this day too long just to let it all go As a child, I was wonder eyed At the thought that I might know A life in the ecstasy of rock n' roll, oh Woah-oh, I'm not taking it slow, oh, oh I'm an arrow in a bow, oh, oh You think that I don't know, oh, oh What it is that makes it glow, oh, oh.. Whenever I fall at your feet I'm really close tonight And I feel like I am moving inside her I'm lying in the dark And I think that I'm beginning to know her Let it go I'll be there when you call Whenever I fall at your feet You let your tears rain down on me Whenever I touch your slow turning pain You're hiding from me now There's something in the way that you're talking Words don't sound right I can hear them all moving inside her Know I'll be waiting when you call Whenever I fall at your feet You let your tears rain down on me Whenever I touch your slow turning pain The finger of blame has turned upon itself And I'm more than willing to offer myself Did you want my presence or need my help Who knows where that might lead And I fallYou were broken Caught up in those games You've never known when just living's enough'Cause we don't hurt when we're hoping So strangers we seek Now, watch it burn to the limit of love Down you go, watch your spirit Caught up in those flames Got too close to the limit of love It's not your fault what you're feeling You've bought into that beautiful lie, alright So close to the limit of love Where nothing matters What you said that night Didn't fade away In the cleanest light, I ain't got nothing to hide Through your lonesome eyes You swore that you could never be satisfied Too close to the limit of loveMy body moves in time We're begging on the feeding line We're lifting out above this head space See, my body overflows But I got my whole damn life Caught up in moments entirely of yours But I'm finding it harder to reason in order to grow And finding it hard is a feeling that all of you know Know, know See, my body keeps in line And I got my whole damn life Oh, and I want to be somebody, somebody, someone You're so desperate now Oh no, you won't let it go But you bit off your tongue to become one And nevertheless, when this pain in my chest seems to grow I'm living it harder to feel what it feels like to know You know, know, knowIt was the strangest night The kind of scene I don't fit into It didn't feel so right And she came back 'round Drifting across my sight Some apparition of make believe I felt my chest grow tight And I tumbled in And she said, ""Hey baby, hold my hand out on the wire""Oh, I'm telling you, the whole thing is just a breaking of desire You inevitably hold on, because you always do You gotta walk that wire Oh, I'm talkin' in tongues, 'cause I'm not made of steel Somebody save me from myself I'm just a man, alright And I'm fumbling With all this fading light May be the moment to make my move You hold your breath so tight'Cause we're tumblingAnd I've been worried for a while now Cause you don't look the same How the devil takes his toll When you go walking through that flame And I'm not saying it's been easy But you know all too well Oh, you cannot replace the space Your spirit had once held So we run through the jungle And I can feel the rhythm of war You see, I'm fighting But I just can't fight anymore I'm in awe...So we'll give ourselves to the harlequin dream Giving over all our friends and our family And we'll say goodbye to the world that we love For I can no longer deny my blood And now you're taking on a kingdom I'm ravenous for more Oh, an appetite so beautiful But vacant to its core'Cause you're hurting I can tell by the way that you move You got your head on your chest And your chest in your mouth, you don't look so good There'll be change Cause this one's too big not to see But brother, you're scared and I'm scared When you're scared, 'cause you ain't supposed to be So I'll scream out loud, 'Won't you get out my way ''Cause I got the animal I've got the beast on a leash these days So you don't go wandering back down the black To that awful place And help Is well on its way You taught me too much to sit back And watch you this way Just to watch you this wayThere's a night owl and it laughs at me Says what you're coming for is insane But you can't possibly know me well I'm the people's panic today Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong Or maybe I'm just dumb Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong Or maybe I'm just dumb I made a plan to get on living Took a chance to hold on tight To the fantasy I'm givin' in I guess I thought it'd be alright Cause there's a night owl, and it laughs at me Says what you're coming for is insane But you can't possibly know me well I'm the people's panic today Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong Or maybe I'm just dumb Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong Or maybe I'm just dumbHey boy, now, what you making Looking up as you go I heard your voice just the other day, on the radio But like an ancient shrine that has swallowed your mind Well, you lost yourself with nothing to say I'd not the heart to ask you to stay Sweet times, all made up in my mind Where'd you go Where'd you go Where'd you go Where'd you go I know that wonder couldn't wake you From a slumber so slow Hazy Jane, well you known my name for a while now And all that wasted time following dotted lines Is enough to send a man insane I'd not the heart to ask you to stay Sweet times, all made up in my mind Where'd you go Where'd you

Pulling thorns out of my palm Work a midnight surgery When you cut a hole into my skull Do you hate what you see like I do Black hole opened in the kitchen Every clock's a different time It would only take the energy to fix it I don't know why I am The way I am Not strong enough to be your man I tried, I can't Stop staring at the ceiling fan and Spinning out about things that haven't happened Breathing in and out Drag racing through the canyon Singing ""Boys Don't Cry""Do you see us getting scraped up off the pavement I don't know why I am The way I am Not strong enough to be your man I

spinnin' out When you don't know who you are You fuck around and find out When you called me from the train Water freezin' in your eyes You were happy and I wasn't surprised And it feels good to be known so well I can't hide from you like I hide from myself Now you're movin' in Breakin' a sweat on your upper lip And gettin' pissed about humidity And the leaky faucet You already hurt my feelings three times In the way only you couldIt's a bad idea and I'm all about it Give it one more chance and Then I finally had it When you wake up, I'll be gone again Motorcycle in the front lawn It's an

tenderness, no tenderness I will show no mercy for you You had no mercy for me The only thing that I ask, love me mercilessly While your shouting friends that despise you to your face What would they say now if they saw you in this place Naked and breathless, could you live with this disgrace Could you live  Could you live  Could you live with this And there will be no tenderness, no tenderness There will be no tenderness, no tenderness I will show no mercy for you You had no mercy for me The only thing that I ask, love me mercilessly If I put my hands around your wrists, would you fight them If I put my fingers in your mouth, would you bite them So many things that I would do if I had my way with youPeople, they don't mean a thing to you They move right through you, just like your breath But sometimes, I still think of you And I just wanted to, just wanted you to know My old friend I swear I never meant for this I never meant Don't look at me that way It was an honest mistake Don't look at me that way It was an honest mistake, an honest mistake Sometimes, I forget I'm still awake I fuck up and say these things out loud My old friend I swear I never meant for this I never meantSometimes I feel Like I wanna leave this place for good Under the ground I'll live down there without a sound And never hear These hissing voices all the same I'll disappear Cause living makes me feel ashamed I must believe There's more above us and below I must believe Stranded with this bitch called hope It keeps me here When all I wanna do is go It keeps me here When all I wanna do is disappear If this is it When all we have and ever will If this is it Time is running out and standing still I'll leave today Cause there's nothing left to keep me here I'll fade away I'll turn my back and disappear The city moves Lunges up right from the ground The seething Earth It opens up and spits us out This vicious child Nature never wanted us This vicious child A cancer burning black into its heartWhenever I look back On the best days of my life I think I saw them all on T VI am so homesick now For someone that I never knew I am so homesick For some place I will never be Time won't let me go Time won't let me go If I could do it all again I'd go back and change everything but Time won't let me go I never had a ""Summer of '69""Never had a Cherry Valence of my own All these precious moments You promised me would come in time So where was I when I missed mine Time won't let me go Time won't let me go If you gave me back those years I'd do it all better I swear Time won't let me goTell me Come on tell me what you can Even as you wait for death You're wiser than I am Tell me What does it mean to exist I am not a scientist I must believe in more than this I cannot accept Everything that's real Is only what our eyes can see And our hands can feel Not even Earth could hold us Not even life controls us Not even the ground can keep us down The memories in my head Are just as real as the time we spent You'll always be close to me my friend This is not the end I see I can see you're so afraid You wear it like a silver hood On you, even fear looks goodI spent my whole life surrounded And I spent my whole life alone I wonder why, I never wonder why the easiest things are so hard I just want, I just want love I just want, I just want love I just want, I just want love I just want Somethin', somethin' for nothin'Oh, somethin', somethin' for nothin''Cause I'm a beggar and a chooser, I'm accused and accuser But nothing's unconditional I hold the whole world accused And I only got myself to blame I wonder why, I never wonder why the easiest things are so hard I just want, I just want love I just want, I just want love I just want, I just want love I just wantI climbed up a mountain, and looked off the edge At all of the lives that I never have led There's one where I stayed with you, across the sea I wonder, do you still think of me I carry your image always in my head Folded and yellowed and torn at the edge And I've look upon it for so many years Slowly I'm losing your face Oh, the ocean rolls us away, away, away The ocean rolls us away Sixes and sevens, we live on jet planes So many faces, I don't know the names So many friends now, and none of them mine Forgotten as soon as we meet All of these moments are lost in time But you're caught in my head like a thorn on a vine To forever torment me, and I wonder why Do I wish I'd never known you at all Oh, the ocean rolls us away, away, away The ocean rolls us away Oh, the ocean rolls us away, away, away The ocean rolls us awayWe are liars like a summer time Like the spring, we are such fools Like fall, we are false prophets And like winter, we are cruel I don't know what's wrong with us They just made us this way There's a hole in you and me That pulls us together And I don't know where we belong I think we grew under a bad sun I know we're not like everyone You and me, we grew under a bad sun Every day you bring me pain And we savor it like rain We hold it on our tongues Just like wine Someday back when we were young I guess something just went wrong The two of us are hung From the same twisted rope And I don't know where we belong I think we grew under a bad sun I know we're not like everyone You and me, we grew under a bad sunThe faces all around me, they don't smile, they just crack Waiting for our ship to come, but our ship's not coming back We do our time like pennies in a jar What are we saving for  What are we saving for There's a smell of stale fear that's reeking from our skins The drinking never stops because the drinks absolve our sins We sit and grow our roots into the floor But what are we waiting for  What are we waiting for So give me something to believe'Cause I am living just to breathe And I need something more To keep on breathing for So give me something to believe Something's always coming, you can hear it in the ground It swells into the air with the rising, rising sound And never comes, but shakes the boards and rattles all the doors What are we waiting for  What are we waiting for So give me something to believe'Cause I am living just to breathe And I need something more To keep on breathing for So give me something to believe"

Jonatha Brooke,adult alternative artists,10,"I am not a child now I can take care of myself I mustn't let them down now Mustn't let them see me cry I'm fine I'm fine I'm too tired to listen I'm too old to believe All these childish stories There is no such thing as faith And trust And pixie dust I try, but it's so hard to believe I try, but I can't see where you see I try I try I try My whole world is changing I don't know where to turn I can't leave you waiting But I can't stay and watch This city burn Watch it burnIn the gloaming, oh my darling When the lights are soft and low And the quiet shadows falling Softly come and softly go When the trees are sobbing faintly With a gentle unknown woe Will you think of me and love me As you did once long ago In the gloaming, oh my darling Think not bitterly of me Though I passed away in silence Left you lonely, set you free For my heart was tossed with longing What had been could never be It was best to leave you thus, dear Best for you and best for me'Cause in the gloaming, oh my darling When the lights are soft and low Will you think of me and love me As you did once long ago And you say that you're okay You say you don't need anything, or anyone And that you're better off this way You'll be fine no matter what What's done is done Walking through these darkened rooms Filled with empty promises, and your perfume I'll leave the light on I know you'll be back I don't need to know any more than that So don't say a word, don't tell me where you've been I'll be here waiting, just to let you in And you tell me I'm naïve That love is not a fairy tale Maybe so, who would know 'Cause I'm the fool who still believes That there's a happy ending here Oh, that time will tell and love will knowI'm still chasing cars Playing in the undertow Barking at the stars, wondering where you are Thinking that I'll never know I still play with fire Hoping that I might get burned Toying with desire, teasing to the wire Thinking that I'll never learn Some things I earn Some things I steal And there's an angel on my shoulder But the devil's got the wheel I toe the line, but then I fall'Cause heaven knows I like the taste of danger most of all Danger most of all Standing on a ledge Don't you know I wanna jump Not that I would give my desire to live I just wanna try it once I just wanna know What it is to make the leap How the wind would blow, how fast I could go Who would pray my soul to keepI am walking past the sprinklers and the newly painted porches And the lemonade stand girls on a suburban afternoon I am leaving 'cause I love you, I am leaving 'cause I don't And I'm, I'm hoping you will follow And I'm praying that you won't let me go And I am captive in your presence I will melt before your eyes But I still crave your approval And I'm helpless when you criticize, criticize'Cause it's written on your body, it's on the tip of your tongue The look in your eyes in the glare of the sun The touch of your cold fingers when you say goodbye The way that you linger, the way that you lie You saw me through the keyhole of the door that I kept locked But I'd decorate the threshold just in case you knocked What I might feel on the edges you will never come to know And who I might be in the corners I will never ever, ever, ever show Ever show, noAll things being equal Her beauty was not her fault And it was not her only advantage Midst the feast and the novelty The manliness of his charms So was it really such a shock So much history in a kiss Besides they both knew it was over And what do they have to worry about Just privacy and pain And the damage they've done Is this all Can I go now Is this all Is this all Can I go now Is this all Hey, hey Hey So when you sleep do not dream Oh the dreams they weigh you down When you carry them along with you They will wrack your lovely body Report back to your soul With all the sickening sweets of the afternoon As we lose the last of innocence Like some romantic notion Buried by the fashion of disdain You can make the world your apple But take a bite before it sours Or you can make the world your charm or your chainWhen I was a little girl I had desires like you One of everything All the riches How could I help myself I was so naïve Santa Claus, Christmas eve, oh Careful what you wish for Careful what you do Even when you whisper Someone's listening to you Careful what you wish for Careful what you say Careful what you wish for'Cause it just might come true someday Now that I have everything I'm a puppet on a string Someone's got the end and I'm unraveling And here's the thing I would throw it all away If I could only hear you say""Baby I'll stay, baby I'll stay""I never knew what enough was Until I'd had more than my share And I let the darkness in It was then I lost the dare It was then I lost the day There will be no prayers on your return And there will be no party thrown And you will find your inheritance Is the silence that's grown It is the seed that you've sown'Cause you were the one sure thing The one sure thing Maybe I'm not crazy Just inconsolable Inconsolable Ha, hey Ah, hey There is no mystery to be revealed And so we tell the truth and then run I love you because I love you And I did think that you were the one But now I see who you've becomeYou know the tricks of the trade You can hit the soft spots at the center You dish it out and take it back Riding on the wave of your pompous ways Oh, but sooner or later You'll have to wring your lovely hands in dismay You'll go back to the boardroom Add the numbers up and turn the page at the end of the day Where were you at the bleakest of moments Where were you at the hint of success When through the window of opportunity came The glimmer of a day in the sun Glimmer of a day in the sun You took the canvas of a life Torn with the wind and the loss could still pull you along Pocketing images one by one Of the past, toward your future""A penny for your song""Position memories carefully You dust them off at holidays When you'll go back to the boardroom Declare your passion for the new dayI hope you're happy I hope you're happy with your glass half empty Even though you got your share Hope you're happy I hope you're happy with your glass half empty Even though you got your share Kevin you remind me, dot the i's Don't drop the names of those who've come before Ear down to the ground don't compromise Don't close your eyes until you get what you came looking for Kevin you remind me, don't look back, don't second guess Have another go, have another drink, 'cause it won't be long I look down at my hands and saw the violence, so I toss it back It's such a fine line between right and wrong And when you've made your mark They'll take you down And when you've had enough That's when they'll come around"

my dreams are no less than that of yesterday Does anyone really know where we should go Meet me where we can dream, down by the river Everybody's got a dream, down by the sea Meet me where we can dream by the river Who knows where it may lead, yeah The radio's blasting and we're singing And I'm feeling unstoppable When did I let life become so damn hard Well, I'm heading to what dreams are made of I won't turn my back to the stars of yesterday Does anyone really know where we should go Meet me where we can dream, down by the river Everybody's got a dream, down by the sea Meet me where we can dream by the river Does anybody really know where we should go She doesn't have a face of fashion Just an ordinary look at best She walks into a room with passion Extraordinary from the rest It's not the way she wears her hair Not the make up on her face Facination of a Monalisa A mystery that can't be traced Every time she walks away Cool men just stop and cry While other kids were singing ""Jesus Loves Me""She was listening to John Coltrane Always one foot left of centers Always one foot in the rain Her story unfolds Like wildflowers on a vine She never grows old She always on your mind Every time she walks away Cool men just stop and cryElectricity Eye to eye Hey don't I know you I can't speak Stripped my senses On the spot I've never been defenseless I can't even make sense of this You speak and I don't hear a word What would happen if we kissed Would your tongue slip past my lips Would you run away Would you stay Or would I melt into you Mouth to mouth Lust to lust Spontaneously combust Room is spinning Out of control You act like you didn't notice You brushed my hand Forbidden fruit Ring on my finger Your such a moral, moral man Would you throw it away, no question Will I pretend I'm innocent I need some good luck I need a best friend I need a rough dog I need a mountain I need some new clothes, a T V, a cause A trip to nirvana The thrill of applause I need a wet kiss I need to confess I need a vision, religion The right to be silent And then to be heard A week on an island A diet that works I need a dose of the Bible Another course of survival Just talking 'bout the essentials To make me feel alive That's all I need See how easy I am to please That's all I need See how easy I am I need some money, more money and more time A strong cup of coffee A haircut, a lifeline A stranger to trust me My father to love me Seattle, a sunburn And lots of Todd Rundgren I need a guitar To do it on all fours Cool friends, weekends and someone to die forWashed my hands of crimes Pour the water over my skin, my spine Cleans my soul and ease my mind I've been fixed all the damage done Why do I always forget how far I've come I'm done dying for the past I'm done dying for the past Sins all forgiven now Let's call it even shall we Can't you judge me for my love And not mistakes I've made I swear by who I am and not by yesterday I'm done dying for the past I'm done dying for the last time The last time, the last time, the last time In between black and white I disappear Circled around the stone until I landed here I'm done dying for the past I'm done dying for the past I'm done dying I'm done for the last timeWhen's your birthday What's your middle name Who's youre hero What's your favorite flavor ice-cream Can you tell me, tell me this Are you

forever high high high We burned the night around us Sleeping could wait until we die You were the scars of passion And since the crashing came You've broken every promise I walked away I watched you fall I was blind to ya Was lying to ya Like everyone else who watched you fall Say they love you but they're laughing when you crawl It's such a weary feeling When you've been stealing from yourself Wishing the world away Blaming someone else No one can do this for you Straighten you hair Fix your face Take all the pain inside you wash it away I watched you fall I was blind to ya Was lying to ya Like everybody else who watched you fall Say they love you but they're laughing when you crawl"
Marc Broussard,adult alternative artists,10,"Rolling down the road Going no where Guitar packed in the trunk Somewhere round mile marker 112 Papa started hummin the funk I gotta jones in my bones before we know We were singing this melody Stop the car pulled out the guitar Halfway to New Orleans Said take me home Take me home Could feel the sun about to rise When I realized we had nothing to fear It's just me and my daddy and a kid named Cope Making music that nobody would hear And then the sun let up and it split the night Spilling over our jubilee Ten thousand cars by the side of the road Grooving far as the eye can see Said take me home Take me home Said take me home Said take me homeWhen your baby Leaves you all alone And nobody Calls you on the phone Don't you feel like crying Don't you feel like crying Here I am, honey Come on, cry to me When you're all alone In your lonely room And there's nothing But the smell of her perfume Don't you feel like crying Don't you feel like crying Don't you feel like crying Come on, come on, cry to me Whoa, nothing can be sadder Than a glass of wine alone Loneliness, loneliness Just a waste of time, oh yeah You don't ever have to walk alone Oh, you see Come on, take my hand Baby, won't you walk with me Oh yeahThey say a man ain't supposed to cry But I can't seem to stop these tears It's too hard living life without a friend To help me smile If my tears could bring you back to me I'd gladly cry a thousand years Thinking 'bout the feel I get to see your face And say, old friend I'm happy to see you again These walls are not the same Sunny, you have gone and changed You've changed it all I'm so tired of the pain I would live as good as explaining the pain Carry it all I don't know why But I know I miss you That's why they say a man ain't supposed to cry But I can't seem to stop these tears It's too hard living life without a friend To help me smile If my tears could bring you back to me I'd gladly cry a thousand years Thinking 'bout the feel I get to see your face And say, old friend I'm happy to see you againOne sweet surprise at my door You are no dream like I had before But you cry and I'm not sure Why you've come here I don't have much to give to you What I say will sure be true What I will do is drive every tear And if you know how I feel And if you believe my love's for real Real enough to touch And draw near Then reach out and hold me close And in time, you will know That I will drive every tear My friends all say I move too slow Well, I guess that's just how I go Well, I know that I loved you For so many years Oh, and there's so much to hold inside That some nights, alone, I cry With no one to drive every tearOh, tell me what's on your mind Cause I'm hoping all you need is some time You're leaving or so you say Well, I'm not so sure how things turned out this way And I hope you know I'll never put you down And when the times get hard don't to hesitate to turn around Cause I'll, I'll leave a light on You're never too far gone Where ever your heart leads you to roam I'll leave a light on Strangers don't know your name They don't care where you're going or from where you came Though angels may lose their way But I don't have the wings to fly away And I hope you know I'll never put you down And when the times get hard don't to hesitate to turn around Cause I'll, I'll leave a light on You're never too far gone Where ever your heart leads you to roam I'll leave a light on Tell me what's on your mind Was it everything you hoped that you would find You're still running, but I can see That the road you're on is leading back to meOh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling From glen to glen and down the mountainside The summer's gone and all the roses falling It's you, it's

shadow Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy, I love you soI said if I If I don't see ya soon Baby, I might just go crazy See, another night Here in this lonely room Without your body next to mine It makes me suffer, baby Barely alive Burnin' fever love Until I See your face I'm a dyin' man With every breath That weakens me I fear it might be my very last If I don't feel Your tender love Well, I don't think this fever's gonna pass Ain't tryin' to scare you, girl Just want you to know I always loved ya baby, in case I go Until I See your face I'm a dyin' manI think it's a miracle That you're layin' here, right by my side Someone so beautiful Long brown hair and your pretty green eyes Maybe I've done something along the way Sure seems someone's smiling down on me And I'll never have to look for love again So lucky I found you So happy I'm with you And honey I know that there's no mistakin' I'm better with you And I'm grateful, grateful, grateful I got lucky with you Sometimes it takes a while And other times it comes naturally But I took one look at you I knew that you were meant for me You know that I'm not gonna walk away Be here tomorrow just like today And I'll never have to look for love again So lucky I found you So happy I'm with you Oh baby I know, there's no mistakin' I'm better with you And I'm grateful, grateful, grateful I got lucky with youTake her to heart She'll always love you And nobody Can make her do wrong Take her for granted Leaving love unshown Makes willpower weak And temptation strong A woman's only human You should understand She's not just a plaything She's flesh and blood just like her man If you want a do-right-all-days woman You got to be a do-right-all-night man Yeah, yeah, they say that it's a man's world But you can't prove that by me And as long as we're together, baby Show some respect for meThere's never a good time to find the words to say But the last thing you and I need together is another day So before we hurt anymore, I'll be on my way'Cause the last thing you and I need together is another day Another day, to tell us what we've known To sow the seeds we've sown Would it make a difference Another day, to try and right the wrongs When we've known all along We can't make up the distance Honey, we'll never know what's in store If all we're living for is another day Living lies knowing all of the time, you were not the one Trying to force a love with a stranger, when we should have run So many hours in silence, nothing to talk about Both looking for an easy way to say: I just want out Another day, to tell us what we've known To sow the seeds we've sown Would it make a difference Another day, to try and right the wrongs When we've known all along We can't make up the distance Darling, we'll never know what's in store If all we're living for is another day"

Jackson Browne,adult alternative artists,10,"Now the seats are all empty Let the roadies take the stage Pack it up and tear it down They're the first to come and last to leave Working for that minimum wage They'll set it up in another town Tonight the people were so fine They waited there in line And when they got up on their feet they made the show And that was sweet But I can hear the sound Of slamming doors and folding chairs And that's a sound they'll never know Now roll them cases out and lift them amps And haul them trusses down and get 'em up them ramps'Cause when it comes to moving me You know you guys are the champs But when that last guitar's been packed away You know that I still wanna play So just make sure you got it all set to go Before you come for my pianoWell I've been out walking I don't do that much talking these days These days These days I seem to think a lot About the things that I forgot to do For you And all the times I had the chance to And I had a lover But it's so hard to risk another these days These days Now if I seem to be afraid To live the life that I have made in song Well it's just that I've been losing For so long Well I'll keep on moving Moving on Things are bound to be improving These days One of these days These days I'll sit on cornerstones And count the time in quarter tones to ten My friend Don't confront me with my failures I had not forgotten themI'm gonna rent myself a house In the shade of the freeway Gonna pack my lunch in the morning And go to work each day And when the evening rolls around I'll go on home and lay my body down And when the morning light comes streaming in I'll get up and do it again Amen Say it again Amen I want to know what became of the changes We waited for love to bring Were they only the fitful dreams Of some greater awakening I've been aware of the time going by They say in the end it's the wink of an eye And when the morning light comes streaming in You'll get up and do it again Amen Caught between the longing for love And the struggle for the legal tender Where the sirens sing And the church bells ring And the junkman pounds his fender Where the veterans dream of the fight Fast asleep at the traffic light And the children solemnly wait For the ice cream vendorLooking out at the road rushing under my wheels Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields In '65, I was seventeen and running up 101 I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on Running on, running on empty Running on, running blind Running on, running into the sun But I'm running behind Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive In '69, I was twenty-one and I called the road my own I don't know when that road turned onto the road I'm on Running on, running on empty Running on, running blind Running on, running into the sun But I'm running behindWell, just a-look at that girl With the lights comin' up in her eyes She's got to be somebody's baby She must be somebody's baby All the guys on the corner stand back And let her walk on by She's got to be somebody's baby She must be somebody's baby She's got to be somebody's baby She's so fine She's probably somebody's only light Gonna shine tonight Yeah, she's probably somebody's baby, all right I heard her talkin' with her friend When she thought nobody else was around She said she's got to be somebody's baby She must be somebody's baby‘Cause when the cars and the signs and the streetlights Light up the town She's got to be somebody's baby She must be somebody's baby She's got to be somebody's baby She's soNow the words had all been spoken And somehow the feeling still wasn't right And still we continued on through the night Tracing our steps from the beginning Until they vanished into the air Trying to understand how our lives had led us there Looking hard into your eyes There was nobody I'd ever known Such an empty surprise To feel so alone Now for me some words come easy But I know that they don't mean that much Compared with the things that are said when lovers touch You never knew what I loved in you I don't know what you loved in me Maybe the picture of somebody you were hoping I might be Awake again, I can't pretend And I know I'm alone And close to the end Of the feeling we've knownDoctor, my eyes have seen the years And the slow parade of fears without crying Now I want to understand I have done all that I could To see the evil and the good without hiding You must help me if you can Doctor, my eyes Tell me what is wrong Was I unwise to leave them open for so long 'Cause I have wandered through this world And as each moment has unfurled I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams People go just where they will I never noticed them until I got this feeling That it's later than it seems Doctor, my eyes Tell me what you see I hear their cries Just say if it's too late for meEverybody I talk to is ready to leave With the light of the morning They've seen the end coming down long enough to believe That they've heard their last warning Standing alone Each has his own ticket in his hand And as the evening descends I sit thinking 'bout Everyman Seems like I've always been looking for some other place To get it together Where with a few of my friends I could give up the race And maybe find something better But all my fine dreams Well thought out schemes to gain the motherland Have all eventually come down to waiting for Everyman Waiting here for Everyman Make it on your own if you think you can If you see somewhere to go I understand Waiting here for Everyman Don't ask me if he'll show Baby I don't knowKeep a fire burning in your eye And pay attention to the open sky You never know what will be coming down I don't remember losing track of you You were always dancing in and out of view I must've thought you'd always be around Always keeping things real by playing the clown Now you're nowhere to be found I don't know what happens when people die Can't seem to grasp it as hard as I try It's like a song I can hear playing right in my ear that I can't sing I can't help listening And I can't help feeling stupid standing 'round Crying as they ease you down'Cause I know that you'd rather we were dancing Dancing our sorrow away No matter what fate chooses to play Just do the steps that you've been shown By everyone you've ever known Until the dance becomes your very own No matter how close to yours another's steps have grown In the end, there is one dance you'll do aloneYou take Sally and I'll take Sue There ain't no difference between the two Cocaine, running all 'round my brain Headin' down Scott, turnin' up Main Looking for that girl who sells cocaine Cocaine, runnin' all 'round my brain Mmm momma come here quick That old cocaine 'bout to make me sick Cocaine, runnin' all 'round my brain Late last night about a quarter past four Ladanyi come knockin' down my hotel room door Where's the cocaine Said it's runnin' all 'round my brain I was talking to my doctor down at the hospital He said, ""Son, it says here you're twenty-seven But that's impossible Cocaine, you look like you could be forty-five"""

It's glistening once again With candy canes and silver lanes aglow It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas Toys in every store But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be On your own front door A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots Is the wish of Barney and Ben Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk Is the hope of Janice and Jen And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas Everywhere you go There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;Soon the bells will start And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing Right within your heart It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas Toys in every store But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be On your own front doorAnother summer day has come and gone away In Paris and Rome, but I wanna go home, mmm May be

how are you Well, I would send them, but I know that it's just not enough My words were cold and flat And you deserve more than that Another aeroplane, another sunny place I'm lucky, I know, but I wanna go home Mmm, I got to go home Let me go home I'm just too far from where you are I wanna come home And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life It's like I just stepped outside When everything was going right And I know just why you could not come along with me That this was not your dream But you always believed in me Another winter day has come and gone away In either Paris or Rome, and I wanna go home Let me go home And I'm surrounded by a million people, I I still feel alone Oh, let me go home Oh, I miss you, you knowWhen marimba rhythms start to play Dance with me, make me sway Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore Hold me close, sway me more Like a flower bending in the breeze Bend with me, sway with ease When we dance you have a way with me Stay with me, sway with me Other dancers may be on the floor Dear, but my eyes will see only you Only you have that magic technique When we sway I go weak I can hear the sounds of violins Long before it begins Make me thrill as only you know how Sway me smooth, sway me now Other dancers may be on the floor Dear, but my eyes will see only you Only you have that magic technique When we sway I grow weak I can hear the sounds of violins Long before it begins Make me thrill as only you know how Sway me smooth, sway me nowJust because I wander 'round the places we would go Hopin' that I'd run into you one last time Just because I never took your picture off my phone Doesn't mean that you're still on my mind Just because I accidentally slip and say your name When I hear our song, it makes me insecure Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same Doesn't mean I love you anymore Am I lyin' to myself again When I say you're not the best I've ever had Am I lyin' to myself again When I say that I'm not missing you so bad Just because I'm on my knees and swearing I will change And I'd do anything to hear you say, ""I'm yours""Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same Doesn't mean I love you anymore Am I lyin' to myself again When I say you're not the best I've ever had Am I lyin' to myself again When I say that I'm not missing you so bad You're a falling star, you're the getaway car You're the line in the sand when I go too far You're the swimming pool on an August day And you're the perfect thing to say And you play it coy, but it's kinda cute Ah, when you smile at me, you know exactly what you do Baby, don't pretend that you don't know it's true'Cause you can see it when I look at you And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times It's you, it's you, you make me sing You're every line, you're every word You're everything You're a carousel, you're a wishing well And you light me up, when you ring my bell You're a mystery, you're from outer space You're every minute of my everyday And I can't believe, uh, that I'm your man And I get to kiss you, baby, just because I can Whatever comes our way, ah, we'll see it through And you know that's what our love can doTime goes by And I've been holding everything inside But now I've got nothing left to hide When I'm with you, oh, you But I can see How strong a man I'm gonna have to be To do for you what comes so naturally It's in the way you move And all I want Is a chance to prove Show all I can do I believe in starting over I can see that your heart is true I believe in good things coming back to you You're the light that lifts me higher So bright, you guide me through I believe in you And I don't mind If you want to hold onto me tight You don't have to sleep alone tonight If you don't want toSanta baby, slip a Rolex under the tree, for me I've been an awful good guy Santa buddy, and hurry down the chimney tonight Santa buddy, a '65 convertible too, steel blue I'll wait up for you dude Santa buddy, and hurry down the chimney tonight Think of all the fun I've missed Think of all the hotties that I never kissed Next year I could be just as good If you'd check off my Christmas list Santa pally, I wanna yacht and

Jeff Buckley,adult alternative artists,10,"Well I heard there was a secret chord That David played, and it pleased the Lord But you don't really care for music, do ya Well it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth The minor fall and the major lift The baffled king composing ""Hallelujah""Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof You saw her bathing on the roof Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya And she tied you to her kitchen chair And she broke your throne and she cut your hair And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah HallelujahThere's the moon asking to stay Long enough for the clouds to fly me away Well it's my time coming, I'm not afraid, afraid to die My fading voice sings of love But she cries to the clicking of time, oh, time Wait in the fire, wait in the fire Wait in the fire, wait in the fire And she weeps on my arm Walking to the bright lights in sorrow Oh drink a bit of wine we both might go tomorrow, oh my love And the rain is falling and I believe my time has come It reminds me of the pain I might leave, leave behind Wait in the fire, wait in the fire Wait in the fire, wait in the fire I might leave, leave behind And I feel them drown my name So easy to know and forget with this kiss I'm not afraid to go but it goes so slowLooking out the door I see the rain Fall upon the funeral mourners Parading in a wake of sad relations As their shoes fill up with water Maybe I'm too young To keep good love from going wrong But tonight you're on my mind So you never know Broken down and hungry for your love With no way to feed it Where are you tonight, child You know how much I need it Too young to hold on And too old to just break free and run Sometimes a man gets carried away When he feels like he should be having his fun And much too blind to see the damage he's done Sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no-one So I'll wait for you, and I'll burn Will I ever see your sweet return Oh, will I ever learn This is our last goodbye I hate to feel the love between us die But it's over, just hear this and then I'll go You gave me more to live for, more than you'll ever know Well, this is our last embrace Must I dream and always see your face Why can't we overcome this wall Baby, maybe it's just because I didn't know you at all Kiss me, please kiss me Kiss me out of desire, baby, not consolation Oh, you know it makes me so angry cause I know that in time I'll only make you cry, this is our last goodbye, ohhh Ooooh Ooooh Ooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Did you say, ""No, this can't happen to me!""Did you rush to the phone to call Was there a voice unkind In the back of your mind Saying maybe You didn't know him at all You didn't know him at all, oh oh, ya didn't know Ooohh, didn't knowI lost myself on a cool, damp night I gave myself in that misty light Was hypnotized by a strange delight Under a lilac tree I made wine from the lilac tree Put my heart in its recipe It makes me see what I want to see And be what I want to be When I think more than I want to think I do things I never should do I drink much more than I ought to drink Because it brings me back you Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love Listen to me, I cannot see clearly Isn't that she coming to me  Nearly hereI'm lying in my bed, the blanket is warm This body will never be safe from harm Still feel your hair, black ribbons of coal Touch my skin to keep me whole Oh, if only you'd come back to me If you laid at my side Wouldn't need no Mojo Pin To keep me satisfied Don't wanna weep for you, don't wanna know I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow Memories fire, the rhythms fall slow Black Beauty, I love you so Oh, precious precious silver and gold And pearls in oyster's flesh Drop down we two to serve And pray to love Born again from the rhythm Screaming down from heaven Ageless, ageless And I'm there in your armsLove, let me sleep tonight on your couch And remember the smell of the fabric of your simple city dress Oh..  that was so real Oh..  that was so real Oh..  that was so real We walked around til the moon got full like a plate And the wind blew an invocation and I fell asleep at the gate And I never stepped on the cracks cause I know I'd hurt my mother And I couldn't awake from the nightmare that sucked me in and pulled me under Pulled me under Oh..  that was so real Oh..  that was so real Oh..  that was so real I love you, but I'm afraid to love you I love you, but I'm afraid to love you I'm afraid.. There is a child sleeping near his twin The pictures go wild in a rush of wind That dark angel he is shuffling in Watching over them with his black feather wings unfurled The love you lost with her skin so fair Is free with the wind in her butterscotch hair Her green eyes blew goodbyes With her head in her hands And your kiss on the lips of another Dream, brother with your tears scattered round the world Don't be like the one who made me so old Don't be like the one who left behind his name Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine And nobody ever came Don't be like the one who made me so old Don't be like the one who left behind his name Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine And nobody ever came Don't be like the one who made me so old Don't be like the one who left behind his name Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine And nobody ever came Nobody ever cameHe bear her off, he bear her down He bear her into an orchard ground Lu li lu lay lu li lu lay The falcon hath bourne my mate away And in that orchard there was a hold That was hanged with purple and gold And in that hold there was a bed And it was hanged with gold so red Lu li lu lay lu li lu lay The falcon hath bourne my mate away And on this bed there lyeth a knight His wound is bleeding day and night By his bedside kneeleth a maid And she weepeth both night and day Lu li lu lay lu li lu lay The falcon hath bourne my mate awayEternal life is now on my trail Got my red glitter coffin, man, just need one last nail While all these ugly gentlemen play out their foolish games There's a flaming red horizon that screams our names And as your fantasies are broken in two Did you really think this bloody road Would pave the way for you You better turn around And blow your kiss hello to life eternal, angel Racist everyman, what have you done Man, you've made a killer of your unborn son...Crown my fear your king at the point of a gun All I want to do is love everyone...And as your fantasies are broken in two Did you really think this bloody road Would pave the way for you You better turn around And blow your kiss hello to life eternal"

Security Wie es heute ist, war nicht unser Wille, ehrlich Welcher Sklave macht über hundert Mille jährlich Kenneth sitzt bei stern T V und lügt, um sein'n Ruf zu retten Doch du würdest eigentlich so gern in mein'n Schuhen stecken Du bist vogelfrei, weil du den Ehrenkodex brichst Du bist nicht intressant für diese Medien ohne mich Ich bin angeblich Sklave der Familie Abou-Chaker Schäm dich – Arafat war sowas wie dein Vater Du hast dank uns gelebt so wie ein König in Berlin Ein Vermögen hier verdient, plötzlich hör' ich, dass du fliehst Du hast vergessen, wo du herkommst, das Geld raubt dir die Sinne Aber kein Problem, ich helf' dir auf die Sprünge, Kay!Ich erzähl's dir nochmal, warte kurz Ich fang' an nach der Trennung deiner Nabelschnur, irgendwo in Ravensburg Für dich ist die Bonzen-Gegend sowas wie die Bronx gewesen Man könnte auch von „Malibu's Most Wanted“ reden Mit deinen Durags und der ekligen Baggy Dachtest du im Ernst, du bist der schwäbische NellyÜberheblicher Kenny wollte unbedingt so hart sein Plünderte sein Sparschwein und gründete dann Chablife Doch mal angenomm'n, Jaysus hätt sich deiner niemals angenomm'n Dann wärst du nie vorangekomm'n„Wie schreibt man ein'n ganzen Song “ – Der Typ war dein Lehrer Als Dank dafür belügst und betrügst du ihn später Und dann zogst du wie die Heuschrecken weiter Jeder wusste, Nummer eins in Sachen Deutschrap war Staiger Du unterschriebst den Bunker-Deal Doch anstatt dich mal zu freuen, ging's dir damals schon nur drum, ob du genug verdienst Du hattest ein paar echte Freunde, doch lieber Hingst du ab mit irgendwelchen Boygroup-Mitgliedern Du dachtest, es wird Zeit, dass ich den Bunker verlass'Daraufhin schrieb deine Mutter ein Fax, könnt ihr Staiger fragen Nach ein paar Tagen fiel dir auf, dass du 'ne Wohnung brauchst Ab jetzt lebt Kay bei Akay von Overground Und tauscht das erste Mal Freunde gegen Fame Räudiges Benehm'n wird man später häufiger noch seh'n Läuft bei dir, Kay – traurig, aber wahr Jetzt muss der nächste herhalten, Hauptsache ein Star Dann hast du Eko Fresh getroffen, der glaubt, du seist begabt Der, so gut er konnte, deinen Aufenthalt bezahlt Der dich bei sich wohn'n ließ, es ging nicht um Million'n-Deals Sondern, dass du Promo kriegst und auch ein bisschen Kohle siehst Erinner dich, Kay, die Kölner hab'n dich mit ernährt Im Café den Clown zu spiel'n war dir ein paar Kippen wert Sie besorgten Nebenjobs, damit du was dazuverdienst Doch seit dem ersten Clip mit Eko fühltest du dich zu berühmt Er rief Olli an, doch der schickte auch kein Geld Weil dein Stiefvater wollte, dass du auf die Schnauze fällst Er hat nicht an dich geglaubt, als Ek an dich geglaubt hat Und was machst du aus Dank dafür  Du haust ab Gibst schon wieder dein'n Gönnern ein'n Laufpass Kay, du wolltest unbedingt zu mir in die Hauptstadt Doch du hattest zu mir gar kein'n Draht Also krochst du erst in Saad sein'n Arsch, tja, so kennt man dich Du wolltest Backup-Rapper werden bei ihm Hofftest insgeheim, er nimmt dich mit hierher nach Berlin Aber nein, Kay, es tat sich nichts, also kam dir die Idee Dass du mir einfach bei Myspace 'ne Nachricht schickst Du hast gelogen, Saad hätte dich abgezogen Auf diese Weise suchtest du den Kontakt nach oben Ich wollt die Schulden deiner Mutter bezahl'n Zu diesem Zeitpunkt kannt ich deine Mucke nicht mal Ich lud dich ein – Schweiz, Silvester, Solo-Show Du warst für mich sowieso nur ein Clown wie Cosimo Wie ein Landstreicher bist du mit mir heimgefahr'n Blind, du hast nicht mal deinen Eltern Bescheid gesagt Seltsam, deine Art, doch du hast mir leid getan Schulden hier, Schulden da, der arme Kay, der pleite war Ich bin darauf reingefall'n und hab' für dich gesorgt Und alles, was du brauchtest, hattest du sofort Ich hab' für dich gebürgt und mich grade gemacht Alle haben über die blondierten Haare gelacht Und Arafat nahm dich mit ins Katzbach-Café Und machte allen klar: „Keiner lacht über Kay“Er sagte nur: „Der Junge ist jetzt einer von uns Und einen von uns behandelt keiner wie 'nen Hund“, yeah Es gefiel dir, wie ein Cowboy durch die Stadt zu reiten Du wolltest unbedingt Bilal Abou-Chaker heißen Disco rein, Disco raus, Party mit den Fotzen Jeden Tag besoffen und Ari trägt die Kosten Wie oft hast du eine dicke Lippe riskiert Weil du wusstest, wegen uns will keiner ficken mit dir Denn Berlin hat kein'n Respekt vor einem Metrosexuell'n Aber Papa Arafat regelt das mit Schell'n Und heut hast du die Dreistigkeit zu lästern Doch er hat seine eigenen Cousins geschlagen, weil sie zu dir frech war'n Du legtest dich in Sachen Ari jetzt ins Zeug Und so wurde er dein allerbester Freund – Jackpot Für jeden deiner Studiotage hab' ich geblecht Bares und Schecks, wie du weißt, bezahl' ich gerecht Ich nahm dich mit auf jede Tour – Österreich, Deutschland, Schweiz Damit wollt ich zeigen, Kay, was Freundschaft heißt Bracht dich auf die Leinwand, featurte dich ständig Für dich war das alles selbstverständlich Vier

but Trace it back to the start When that big ol' fire came towards the Nannup town Well that greedy thing burnt more than the bush down You can bury that head and try to forget He's still waking up with Coffee, Methadone & Cigarettes In the summer of fifty-eight When innocence, shattered and broke The tree, the egg, the nest, the breast, the yolk When those thieving flames took my Granddad from my Pa And ever since then we've been mending all those scars But the bandages and ointments ain't done it He's still waking up with Coffee, Methadone & Cigarettes That broken bird somehow grew With the seven brothers and sisters moved From the country to the zoo Between the legacy visits and the boarding schools Yes he learned to dodge the books And he learned to dodge the foolsLost my love, lost my light I can't find them anymore If there's something I could give I would have given it before now, because I came back a little broken Things don't fit anymore And I wait for spring to come But how long Tell me how long'Cause I wither at my post I'm walking like a ghost, alone How long Tell me how long How long Somewhere out there on the horizon Maybe there's a glimmer of hope Maybe it's just a mirage'Cause you never knowBen got a job at the Mine along the way He said everything was fine until that fateful day That's when his luck started to change The day he went to help and go blow up that Mountain Range Ben moved to Town a year ago or maybe more Straight out of Highschool, the whole he had in store Wanted to travel, needed some dough Everybody worked the Mines Why should he say no Don't ask him why, he can't explain Why now things for him have changed It's not his land, they're not his songs He can't work out why he don't belong{Chorus}He part of Company, part of Company, part of Company Sin Won't someone please tell the lad when Humbug did begin Part of Company, part of Company, part of Company Sin Won't someone please tell the lad when Humbug did begin Now legend has it, or so they say The Bones of an Ancient People, yeah that's where they lay And their Descendants hold close to heart Oh, that Mountain Range Ben was helping blow apart And so I said for Ben things weren't quite right Now he's waking up screaming every single night Hearing voices in a different tongue The screaming of the Old, yeah, the screaming of the Young"
David Byrne,adult alternative artists,10,"I wish I was a camera I wish I was a postcard I welcome you to my house You didn't have to go far A house and a garden There are, there's plants and trees Make a, a closer inspection If you get, get down on your knees Now everybody's coming to my house And I'm never gonna  be alone And everybody's coming to my house And they're never gonna go back home I'm pointing and describing And I can be your guide The skin is just a roadmap The view is very nice Imagine looking at a picture Imagine driving in a car Imagine rolling down the window Imagine opening the doorThe rose is pruned to a perfect shape Perfect for whom, I wonder The chicken thinks in mysterious ways But beauty is not what we're after Now the chicken imagines a heaven Full of roosters and plenty of corn And God is a very old rooster And eggs are like Jesus, his son Every day is a miracle Every day is an unpaid bill You've got to sing for your supper Love one another A cockroach might eat Mona Lisa The pope don't mean shit to a dog And elephants don't read newspapers And the kiss of a chicken is hot The brain of a chicken And the dick of a donkey A pig in a blanket And that's why you want me What does it feel like To be your tongue Moving around in your mouth To be free in the forest of your love A cockroach in the cosmos of your houseWho’ll be my valentine Who’ll lift this heavy load Who’ll share this taxi cab Who wants to climb aboard Who is an honest man Who is an honest man Who’ll help the tired soldier Far from his own hometown Carry these men and women Who get lost when the Sun goes down Who is an honest man Who is an honest man Who walks this dusty road Who always pulls their weight Who’s this   Inside of me Who made a big mistakeI wake up every morning I hear your feet on the stairs You're in the next apartment I hear you singing over there This groove is out of fashion These beats are 20 years old I saw you lend a hand to The ones out standing in the cold Strange overtones in the music you are playing I'll harmonize It is strong and you are tough But a heart is not enough Put on your socks and mittens It's getting colder tonight A snowball in my kitchen I watched it melt before my eyes Your song still needs a chorus I know you'll figure it out The rising of the verses A change of key will let you outHere is a region of abundant details Here is a region that is seldom used Here is a region that continues living Even when the other sections are removed Put your hand out of your pocket Wipe the sweat off of your brow Now it feels like a bad connection No more information now As it passes through your neurons Like a whisper in the dark Raise your eyes to one who loves you It is safe right where you are Here is an area of great confusion Here is a section that's extremely precise And here is an area that needs attention Here is a connection with the opposite side Here, too many sounds for your brain to comprehend Here the sound gets organised into things that make some sense Here there is something we call elucidation Is it the truth or merely a description I'm lazy when I'm lovin', I'm lazy when I play I'm lazy with my girlfriend a thousand times a day I'm lazy when I'm speaking, I'm lazy when I walk I'm lazy when I'm dancin' and I'm lazy when I talk I open up my mouth, air comes rushin' out Nothin', doin' nada, never, how you like me now Wouldn't it be mad, wouldn't it be fine Lazy, lucky lady, dancin', lovin' all the time Oh, I'm wicked and I'm lazy Oh, don't you wanna save me Lazy, lazy Lazy, lazy Now some folks they got money and some folks lives are sweet And some folks make decisions and some folks clean the streets, now Imagine what it feels like, imagine how it sounds If everything were perfect and everything works out No tears are fallin' from my eyes I'm keepin' all the pain inside Now don't you wanna live with me I'm lazy as a man can beIn another dimension Like the clothes that you wear A mighty, mighty battle Sproutin' illegal hair A fitness consultant In the negative zone Wanderin' the city Lookin' for a home I dance like this Because it feels so damn good If I could dance better Well, you know that I would How the rumor got started Oh, one can only guess And the truth don't mean nothin'If you ain't got the cash A credit card mommy An invisible dad Career opportunities That you never hadFor millions of years In millions of homes A man loved a woman A child it was born It learned how to hurt and it learned how to cry Like humans do I'm breathing in I'm breathing out So slip inside this funky house Dishes in the sink The T V's in repair Don't look at the floor Don't go up the stairs I'm achin'I'm shakin'I'm breakin' like Humans do I'm achin'I'm shakin'I'm breakin' like Humans doI used to think that I should watch T VI used to think that it was good for me Wanted to know what folks were thinking To understand the land I live in And I would lose myself And it would set me free This is the place where common people go A global franchise; one department store Yes, there were many awkward moments I had to do some self-atonement Well, if I opened up Well, it would set me free I know, I like Behold and love this giant Big soul, big lips That's me and I am this Everybody gets a touched up hairdo Everybody's in the passing lane Had a reason that she touched all channels The weird things that live in there I took a walk down to the park today I wrote a song called ""Just Like You and Me""I heard the jokes from the sports reporter The rival teams when they faced each other The more I lost myself, the more it set me freeI love America Her secret's safe with me And I know her wicked ways The parts you never see Oh super-girl, you'll be my super-model Although you have a reputation Can I afford to move above my station I'm not the only heart you've conquered And I love America But boy can she be cruel And I know how tall she is Without her platform shoes Oh super-girl, you'll be my super-model Although at times it might seem awkward Don't run away, oh don't you recognize me I'm not the only heart you've conquered And I kissed America When she was fleecing me She knows I understand that she needs to be free"

stripped And my hands can't feel to grip And my toes too numb to step Wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin'I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade Unto my own parade Cast your dancing spell my way I promise to go under it Hey, Mr  Tambourine Man, play a song for me I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm goin' to Hey, Mr  Tambourine Man, play a song for me In the jingle jangle morning, I'll come followin' youOh, I'd rather go and journey Where the diamond crescent's glowing And run across the valley Beneath the sacred mountain And wander through the forest Where the trees

jeweled waters And if you think I'm ready You may lead me to the chasm Where the rivers of our vision Flow into one anotherI think I'm goin' back To the things I learned so well in my youth I think I'm returning to Those days when I was young enough to know the truth Now there are no games To only pass the time No more electric trains No more trees to climb But thinking young and growing older is no sin And I can play the game of life to win I can recall a time When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend Now I think I've got A lot more than just my toys to lend Now there's more to do Than watch my sailboat glide But every day can be A magic carpet ride A little bit of courage is all we lack So catch me if you can, I'm goin' backEight miles high, and when you touch down You'll find that it's stranger than known Signs in the street, that say where you're going Are somewhere just being their own Nowhere is there warmth to be found Among those afraid of losing their ground Rain gray town, known for its sound In places, small faces unbound Round the squares, huddled in storms Some laughing, some just shapeless forms Sidewalk scenes, and black limousines Some living, some standing aloneOh how is it that I could come out to here And be still floating And never hit bottom and keep falling through Just relaxed and paying attention All my two dimensional boundaries were gone I had lost to them badly I saw the world crumble and thought I was dead But I found my senses still working And as I continued to drop through the hole I found all the surrounding To show me the joy that innocently is Just be quiet and feel it around you And I opened my heart to the whole universe And I found it was loving And I saw the great blunder my teachers had made Scientific delirium madness I will keep falling as long as I live All without ending And I will remember the place that is now That has ended before the beginning Oh how is it that I could come out to here And be still floating And never hit bottom and keep falling through Just relaxed and paying attentionSun warm on my face, I hear you Down below moving slow And it's morning Take my time this morning, no hurry To learn to kill and take the will From unknown faces Today was the day for action Leave my bed to kill instead Why should it happen The reasons why, oh, I can't say I have to let you go, babe, and right away After what you did, I can't stay on And I'll probably feel a whole lot better When you're gone Baby, for a long time, you had me believe That your love was all mine, and that's the way it would be But I didn't know, that you were putting me on And I'll probably feel a whole lot better When you're gone Oh, when you're gone Now I've got to say that it's not like before And I'm not gonna play your games anymore After what you did, I can't stay on And I'll probably feel a whole lot better When you're gone Oh, when you're gone Oh, when you're gone Oh, when you're goneThe jukebox is playin' a honky-tonk song""One more"", I keep sayin', ""and then I'll go home""What good will it do me, I know what I'll find An empty bottle, a broken heart and you're still on my mind The people are dancin' and havin' their fun And I sit here thinkin' about what you have done To try and forget you, I've turned to the wine An empty bottle, a broken heart and you're still on my mind Alone and forsaken, so blue I could cry I just sit here drinkin' till the bottle runs dry What good will it do me, I know what I'll find An empty bottle, a broken heart and you're still on my mind An empty bottle, a broken heart and you're still on my mindYou want to know how it will be Me and her, or you and me You both stand there, your long hair flowing Your eyes alive, your mind still growing Saying to me what can we do now that we both love you I love you too And I don't really see Why can't we go on as three You are afraid, embarrassed too No one has ever said such a thing to you Your mother's ghost stands at your shoulders A face like ice, a little bit colder Saying to you, you cannot do that It breaks all the rules, you learned in school But I don't really see Why can't we go on as three We love each other, it's plain to see There's just one answer that comes to be Sister lovers, water brothers, and in time maybe others So you see what we can do is to try something new If you're crazy too And I

closer, then you'll see Come a little closer, then you'll seeI was walking down the street when out the corner of my eye I saw a pretty little thing approaching me She said, ""I never seen a man, who looks so all alone Oh, could you use a little company If you pay the right price, your evening will be nice And you can go and send me on my way.""I said, ""You're such a sweet young thing, why you do this to yourself ""She looked at me and this is what she said:""Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked Money don't grow on trees I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed There ain't nothing in this world for free Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back Though you know, I wish I could Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked Until we close our eyes for good""Not even fifteen minutes later I'm still walking down the street When I saw the shadow of a man creep out out of sight And then he swept up from behind, he put a gun up to my head He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight He said, ""Give me all you've got, I want your money, not your life But if you try to make a move, I won't think twice""I told him, ""You can have my cash, but first you know I gotta ask What made you want to live this kind of life ""In a far and distant galaxy Inside my telescope I see A pair of eyes peer back at me He walks and talks and looks like me He sits around inside his house From room to room, he moves about Fills his life with pointless things And wonders how it all turns out Do-do-do-do-do-do Do-do-do-do-do-do It's safe to say that I don't think you understand There's nowhere left to turn, the walls keep breaking Time is like a leaf in the wind Either it's time well spent or time I've wasted Don't waste it Afraid of what the truth might bring He locks his doors and never leaves Desperately searching for signs Too terrified to find a thing He battens all the hatches down And wonders why he hears no sounds Frantically searching his dreams He wonders what it's all aboutDoctor, look into my eyes I've been breathing air, but there's no sign of life Doctor, the problem's in my chest My heart feels cold as ice, but it's anybody's guess Doctor, can you help me  'Cause I don't feel right Better make it fast before I change my mind Doctor, can you help me  'Cause I don't feel right Better make it fast before I change my mind Well, it's cold, cold, cold, cold inside Darker in the day than the dead of night Cold, cold, cold, cold inside Doctor, can you help me  'Cause something don't feel right Something don't feel right Sweet nurse, don't look at me that way I've seen those eyes before, I can tell you want to play Counselor, give me some advice Tell me, how hard will I fall if I live a double life Doctor, can you help me  'Cause I don't feel right Better make it fast before I change my mind Doctor, can you help me  'Cause I don't feel right Better make it fast, because there ain't much timeSun went down, sun went down over Pompeii On both sides, a vow was broken Oh my, my, I'm the one Trying to hide this damage done One day, all our secrets will be spoken As we slow danced, I became your statue, frozen Times I wonder are we just a puff of smoke  Yeah Underneath this bed of ashes, still withholding everything Like we were never close Don’t you worry, baby, no sense trying to change it I'ma strike these matches, never had control I'm ready to let go, no, was I fooling myself I’ma spread these ashes, never had control I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready to let go Sun went down, sun went down over Pompeii On holy ground, our vows were broken We met up, we broke bread I was blue, your dress was red Ain't it strange We both knew this day was comingI think it's strange when people say You're the next big thing, you'll never fade The slightest touch, forced to fold Sleight of the hand, modern gold Starry-eyed child left behind Choose your favorite vice I don't have the strength to play nice Hide me in the back room, tell me when it's over Don't know if I can play this part much longer I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over Don't know if I can play this part much longer I don't know if it is right to live this way, yeah I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over People always say, ""Man, at least you're on the radio""At least you're on the radio, oh At least you're on the radio, huh At least you're on the radio, oh Close your eyes, don't be afraid Take some of these, they'll ease the pain Live fast, die young, pay the price The best die young, immortalizedOh my precious ember burning, my sweet glowing light From the moment I first saw you, I was yours and you were mine Deep down we both knew you were trouble by design And the echo of my mother's words, ""Baby, don't you play with fire""I was always playing the part First love only set by a spark There was no way changing my mind Now I'm under your spell, trapped in a lie Shouldn't have stood that close to the fire No turning back, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide It's too late to say goodbye Push back from my heart Wish we could go back to the start But oh my god, is this real No more time It's too late, it's too late to say goodbye I can hear the sounds of sirens circling around Forced to watch the ashes floating, softly drifting to the ground Deep down we both knew it was trouble by design And the echo of my mother's words, ""Baby, don't you play with fire""Sweetie Little Jean, where did you go Everyone's been searching high and low And your mother's worried sick Dearest daddy lost his grip While the whole world's watching Candlelight vigils being held in silence On the channel four And they've knocked on every door Every place you've been before How long will we let it go I think we should just let go I, I want you back Let's get back Lay my weary head against your bones Where all my troubles will be dead and gone How long will we let it go I think we should just let go Has melancholy taken you for good You know that I would save you if I could Watched your laughter turn to tears Then you vanished in thin air Well we pinned your missing persons picture up On every mother-loving post How's it feel to be a ghost You're the one I love the most"

troubles roll by When all of your tears dry Let your troubles roll by When all of your tears dry Let your troubles roll by Let your troubles roll byNot been here since I was a boy The sky unwrapped, the world my toy A movie reel a million miles long On and on…Scene after scene passes by my life The window's a wound  The road is a knife The irony, ask me, 'where have you been 'I don't know, I don't know Because I don't know where to begin Too much to do, too much to see Pictures to take, people to meet When there's so much space in between It overwhelms me Scene after scene passes by my life The window's a wound  The road is a knife The irony, ask me, 'where have you been 'I don't know, I don't know Because I don't know where to begin Not been here since I was a boy Now heart full of fear and a mask of painted joy So much for these youthful eyes to see So much for peace and tranquilityGrey sky Always in your eyes Where is the girl behind the cloud Grey sky Always floating by But I only peek when I'm allowed You welcome me in And your veil is so thin But the mystery continues to grow You say, ""You must realize That my grey sky eyes Neither rain nor they glow Now ya' know""They neither rain nor they glow Now ya' know So I I'll try to not act so surprised I'll feel my way, I'll underplay All my curosity And hide all the questions in my skin Grey sky I think I changed my mind I find no need to pretend Grey sky Would you allow me to be So into you, my friend Blinding bright, we see Through renaissance dreaming We believe the daily muse Buried but listening And all we need is gathering Fighting night, we leave All our befallen gifts surround us We retreat to the darkened lodge That's cold with no songs to sing And all we need is gathering So chase the bear Or run away Put on your mittens to curse the flame Spirits from The gallows sang""Stand in the fire but pray for rain""Hollow out yourself Just to take it in again And find the distant sound An empty vessel But it's always haunted, thrashing out Soon we find All we need is gatheringMorning hits me up early I follow my thoughts down the road I take what I find I keep my pockets lined Looking for gifts from the crows They follow me all through the branches They call out the signs of warning They gather and off they go They follow me all through the branches They call out the signs of warning They gather and off they go But I don't want to be All alone, all alone All alone, all alone All alone, all alone All alone, all alone Shining on the way home I found a gift from the crows There's a candle set on the table There's a orange burning low in the sky There's a fragile peace washing over me But it never outpaces the nightChase the high ground Where you'd rather be Where you might be found Face all aglow, to leave from here To pack up and go But it takes some time to get away You will have to build from what remains To run it takes the courage of a lamb To love, the fierceness of a storm Paloma, you wonder if you'll miss the thunder And everyone's staring, but no one is caring for you now Just spread your wings, latch on to the breeze Just take the leap, and you're free Chase the higher ground Where you'd rather be Where you might be found This move may erase the troubles in your head Or expose the absence of your soul"

your face To call you weak and then displace you After carrying your baby on your back across the desert I saw your eyes behind your hair And you're looking tired, but you don't look scaredAll of these lines across my face Tell you the story of who I am So many stories of where I've been And how I got to where I am But these stories don't mean anything When you've got no one to tell them to, it's true I was made for you I climbed across the mountaintops Swam all across the ocean blue I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules But baby, I broke them all for you Oh, because even when I was flat broke You made me feel like a million bucks, you do I was made for you You see the smile that's on my mouth It's hiding the words that don't come out And all of our friends who think that I'm blessed They don't know my head is a messA love song was playing on the radio It made me kind of sad because it made me think of you And I wonder how you're doing, but I wish I didn't care Because I gave you all I had and got the worst of you By the way, I forgive you After all, maybe I should thank you For giving me what I've found'Cause without you around I've been doing just fine Except for any time I hear that song And didn't it break your heart when you watched my smile fading Did it ever cross your mind that one day the tables would be turned They told me the best revenge would be a life well lived And the strongest one that holds would be the hardest one to earn By the way, I forgive you After all, maybe I should thank you For giving me what I've found'Cause without you around I've been doing just fine Except for any time I hear that song Oh, any time I hear that song Waiter send this to the table, the party of one The only other lonely soul in this place And so you're finishing up your coffee But then where're you gonna run Where'd you get that look on your face You should always let the sun go down on your anger Let it burn you to sleep Bring it closer to danger To surrender and retreat Sing your sad soul to sleep I loved you the first time I saw you And you know I love you still But I am tired And I am yours Don't even think about your freedom or taking that flight Or going back upon your promise after fighting for the right Because your eggshells and your ""I"" statements and your weaponized words Are paper tigers now Oh your constant overthinking and your secretive drinking Are making you more and more alone And girl, you can slam the door behind you, it ain't never gonna close Because when you're home, you're already homeI run a lot of miles of life and crime And mountain climbs and quittin' times Packing that load of lyin' rhymes And tired jokes and wooden dimes I've been everybody's friend, everybody's friend I could lose my house, I could steal a car I could serve two masters, living hard Living like a dog in a cage in a yard With a fist full of cold hard cash that I can't let go The devil can't have my soul, the devil can't get your soul The devil can't get your soul Hold out your hand Take hold of mine and then Round and round we go Don't you wanna dance I'm a dying man From the moment we began Hold out your hand Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da Ba da da, ba da da, ba da daThey build wooden houses on frozen ponds In the summertime when the water's gone Diagonal lines in their rolled-out lawns And the sage always smells so pretty But nobody cares where the birds have gone When the rain comes down on Babylon The stone mason's phone rings all day long And you gotta get back to the city I'll build my house up on this rock, baby Every day with you There's nothin' in that town I need After everything we've been through Me out in my garden and you out on your walk Is all the distance this poor girl can take Without listenin' to you talk I don't need their money, baby Just you and me on the rock You and me on the rock I built paper planes when I learned to fly Like a 747 fallin' out of the sky I folded 'em crooked, now I'm wonderin' why I could always end up in the water But nobody's askin' why she lookin' so thin Why she laughin' too hard or why she drinkin' again A fallen star, she's a paper plane She was goin' down when you caught herCome back now, even if you call me out You might be angry now, of course you are I'm scared too, didn't mean to take it out on you I know I always do, you're the strongest person in the room Turn back time, help me to rewind and we can Find ourselves again It's not too late Either way, I lose you in these silent days It wasn't right But it was right on time Don't look down I can feel it when your heart starts pounding It's beyond your control, you know it is It's getting to the point where I can't carry on I never held my breath for quite this long And I don't take it back, I did what I had to do It's not too late Either way, I lose you in these silent days It wasn't right But it was right on timeWelcome to the end of being alone inside your mind You're tethered to another and you're worried all the time You always knew the melody but you never heard it rhyme She's fair and she is quiet, Lord, she doesn't look like me She made me love the morning, she's a holiday at sea The New York streets are as busy as they always used to be But I am the mother of Evangeline The first things that she took from me were selfishness and sleep She broke a thousand heirlooms I was never meant to keep She filled my life with color, canceled plans, and trashed my car But none of that was ever who we are Outside of my windows are the mountains and the snow I hold you while you're sleeping and I wish that I could go All my rowdy friends are out accomplishing their dreams But I am the mother of Evangeline And they've still got their morning paper and their coffee and their time And they still enjoy their evenings with the skeptics and the wine Oh, but all the wonders I have seen, I will see a second time From inside of the ages through your eyes You are not an accident where no one thought it through The world has stood against us, made us mean to fight for you And when we chose your name we knew that you'd fight the power too You're nothing short of magical and beautiful to me Oh, I'll never hit the big time without you So they can keep their treasure and their ties to the machine'Cause I am the mother of EvangelineHe wasn't really known for breaking the rules When he arrived in the second year of my high school He wasn't so much of a twist of fate As a short turn up from a Southern state He was born with a sweet tooth he couldn't beat Always trying to find himself something sweet All that he found was the trouble and me Or maybe trouble just found him It was hard to hide that his heart had scars He would stay up late talking to the stars People tried to blame him for making bad choices When he was only listening to the voices And searching for some kind of deeper truth Between the lines and the Bible and living proof There's no point now to judge him in vain If you haven't been there, you don't know the pain He was a liar, but not a fraud Living proof that there was no God Just the Devil stiff as a rod A slave to a sugartoothIf I don't owe you a favor, you don't know me I don't believe we've ever even met If there's a God in heaven, you can show me Then I guess I should admit I lost the bet There are moments I could hold you forever And there are moments that lasted way too long There are days when I change with the weather To hold you in place would be wrong There's a road left behind me that I'd rather not speak of And a hard one ahead of me, too I love you, whatever you do But I got a life to live, too I never met a morning I could get through With nothing on my breath to hold the night And I never said I'm sorry, but I meant to I never met a coward I don't like There are reasons why a body stays in motion But at the moment, only demons come to mind There are days when I could walk into the ocean With no one else but you to leave behind"

in Shivers in the salty air Day breaks, my heart aches I will wait for you right hereWhispering our goodbyes, waiting for the train I was dancing with my baby in the summer rain I can hear him saying: “Nothing will change Come dance with me, baby, in the summer rain”I remember the rain on his skin And his kisses hotter than the Santa Ana winds Whispering our goodbyes, waiting for the train I was dancing with my baby in the summer rain I remember laughing 'til we almost cried There at the station that night I remember looking in his eyes Oh, my love, it's you that I dream of Oh, my love, since that day Somewhere in my heart, I'm always Dancing with you in the summer rain Doesn't matter what I do now Doesn't matter what I say Somewhere in my heart, I'm always Dancing with you in the summer rain, oh, summer I can hear the whistle, military train I was dancing with my baby in the summer rain I can hear him singing: “Oh, love is strange Come dance with me, baby, in the summer rain”I remember the rain pouring down And we poured our hearts out As the train pulled out I can see my baby waving from the train It was the last time that I saw him in the summer rainI remember when I met you All the stars were hanging in mid-air In those moments nothing mattered But the way you caught me in your stare We were walking, we were talking We were laughing about the state of our lives How our fates brought us together As the moon was rising in your eyes On and on the night was falling Deep down inside us On and on a light was shining Right through Ah, la luna, la luna The night that we fell Under the spell of the moon Ah, la luna, la luna The light that will bring me back to you The light of la luna In the hotels, in the cafés All the world was mad with romance In the harbour, moonlit water All the ships were swaying in a dance Then you held me and you kissed me And I knew I had to be with you You didn't ask me, you just took me To the tiny bed in your tiny roomWho'd ya think you're kidding He's the Earth and Heaven to you Try to keep it hidden Honey, we can see right through you Girl, ya can't conceal it We know how you feel and who you're thinking of No chance, no

And I miss you And now I wonder If I could fall into the sky Do you think time would pass me by 'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles If I could just see you Tonight It's always times like these when I think of you And I wonder if you ever think of me'Cause everything's so wrong, and I don't belong Livin' in your precious memoryCrashed on the floor when I moved in This little bungalow with some strange new friends Stay up too late, and I'm too thin We promise each other it's till the end Now we're spinning empty bottles It's the five of us With pretty eyed boys girls die to trust I can't resist the day No, I can't resist the day Jenny screams out and it's no pose'Cause when she dances, she goes and goes Beer through the nose on an inside joke I'm so excited, I haven't spoken And she's so pretty And she's so sure Maybe I'm more clever than a girl like her The summer's all in bloom The summer is ending soonJust a day, just an ordinary day Just trying to get by Just a boy, just an ordinary boy, but he was looking to the sky And as he asked if I would come along I started to realize That every day he finds just what he's looking for And like a shooting star, he shines And he said, ""Take my hand Live while you can Don't you see your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand ""And as he spoke, he spoke ordinary words Although they did not feel For I felt what I had not felt before And you'd swear those words could heal And as I looked up into those eyes His vision borrows mine And I know he's no stranger For I feel I've held him for all of time, and he said""Take my hand Live while you can Don't you see your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand ""In the palm of your handI know you know We don't see We sow our truth Wait patiently I walk the streets with a song in my head Got my toes on my pup at the foot of my bed Now take the glitz back, I want the soul instead'Cause I found some kind of fairytale I used to hover Outside my truth Always worry Of what I'd lose Take away my record deal Spent the last two years getting to what's real I hope you feel just like I feel I found some kind of fairytaleYou light me up and then I fall for you You lay me down and then I call for you Stumbling on reasons that are far and few I'd let it all come down and then some for you Pretty baby, don't you leave me I have been saving smiles for you Pretty baby, why can't you see You're the one that I belong to I'll be the embrace that keeps you warm For you're the sun that breaks the storm I'll be alright and I'll sleep sound As long as you keep comin' 'round

you leave me I have been saving smiles for you Pretty baby, why can't you see You're the one that I belong to I'll be the embrace that keeps you warm For you're the sun that breaks the storm I'll be alright and I'll sleep sound As long as you keep comin'Man, it's so nice to see you again Near that grey blue pool in L.A.,I close my book, move my bag, make some space'Cause it’s time to give that son a break So, tell me now, how these few years have been What is living to honor the past And I have been well, I say through a smile These feelings, they come and go fast Light your cigarette, I see the fame in your eyes Sing me that new song you sing The time for you and I, it was never quite right That matters, that means everything'Cause the garden walls grow quick Before you know, you’re outside of it The ivy's coming in It's so beautiful if you can find it Time, she’s always kept you on her good side Some people, they still fight their fate I understood clear what you said with your eyes We all speak in different waysStand up straight Do your trick Turn on the stars Jupiter shines so bright When you're around to tell us slow down We're too young you need to grow The speed's the key And they don't know who we are And who's to say that we're not good enough And who's to say that this is not our love Mother don't tell me friends are the ones that I lose Cause they'd bleed before you And sometimes family are the ones you'd choose It's too late now I hold on to this life I found And who's to say we won't burn it out And who's to say we won't sink in doubt Who's to say that we won't fade today Who are they anyway  Anyway they don't knowFor all you broken-hearted lovers lost Go, find another one'Cause you know time won't wait and you'll be late White rabbit's on the run It's hard to know what's good for you I know she let you down But the fever breaks when it's too much to take So you can put your weapons down And all you'll hear is the music And beauty stands before you And love comes back around again It's a carousel, my friend Never too late to change the pace Oh, how the days creep up on you But the goodness is something you don't have to chase'Cause it's following you...And all you'll hear is the music And beauty stands before you And love comes back around again It's a carousel, my friendFind a love Go build a cabin Find land and a tree Carve in a wish On your knees, planting seeds The dirt, making rows, where the devil don’t see My love, I agree, so lucky to find ya But memories, they don’t stay behind us Our minds are strong, could it be enough To bring strength to the bones Our weeping willow is hanging above me On my back in the sun, would it fall upon me I won’t let you down and man you will keep safe my love Safe my love Sow the earth A blanket of bounty In the distance a hearse The devil drives empty In a babies eyes The ritual purifies every designTwo, three I first saw you at the video exchange I know my heart and it will never change This temp work would be alright if you'd call me You'd call me I lay awake at night for you And I pray We'd cross the deepest oceans, cargo across the sea And if you don't believe me, just put your hands on me And all the constellations shine down for us to see And if you don't believe me, just put your hands on me The subway radiates with heat We barely met and still I cross the street To your door We'd cross the deepest oceans, cargo across the sea And if you don't believe me, just put your hands on me And all the constellations shine down for us to see And if you don't believe me, just put your hands on me"

Trees break the sidewalk And the sidewalk skins my knees There's glass in my thermos And blood on my jeans Nickels and dimes of the Fourth of July Roll off in a crooked line To the chain-link lots where the red tails dive Oh, how I forgot what it's like Hey when she sings, when she sings When she sings like she runs Moves like she runs Hey when she moves, when she moves When she moves like she runs Moves like she runsChimney falls and lovers blaze Thought that I was young Now I've freezing hands and bloodless veins As numb as I've become I'm so tired I wish I was the moon tonight Last night I dreamt I'd forgotten my name'Cause I had sold my soul But I woke just the same I'm so lonely I wish I was the moon tonight God blessed me, I'm a free man With no place free to go Paralyzed and collared-tight No pills for what I fear This is crazy I wish I was the moon tonightThe most tender place in my heart is for strangers I know it's unkind but my own blood is much too dangerous Hangin' round the ceiling half the time Hangin' round the ceiling half the time Compared to some I've been around But I really tried so hard That echo chorus lied to me with its""Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on""In the end I was the mean girl Or somebody's in-between girl Now it's the devil I love And that's as funny as real love I leave the party at 3 A.M Alone, thank God With a valium from the bride It's the devil I love It's the devil I love And that's as funny as real love And that's as real as true love That echo chorus lied to me with its""Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on""That echo chorus lied to me with its""Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on""God is not a contract or a guy God is an unspecified tide You cannot time its tables It sets no glass or gables God is a lusty tire fire Its bristles scrape and strike the stage A rock-paper-scissors rage Have mercy on the natural world My voice is not the liquid waves The perfect rings 'round a heron's legs My voice a straight garroting wire A stolen mile of fingerprints Peeled up quiet from their dunes Captured and re-spooled as ruin To be used at a different time My voice is a fracture Of a shinbone's lust Pounding barefoot ground It lifts you up and sits you just Just at sorrow's waterline I drape you on tomorrow's plate Ferrous metal, marrow spilling Not yours, but mine I'm an agent of the natural worldMy love, I am the speed of sound I left them motherless, fatherless Their souls dangling inside-out from their mouths But it's never enough I want you I carved your name across three counties And ground it in with bloody hides Their broken necks will line the ditch'Til you ""Stop it  Stop it  Stop this madness!""I want you I have waited with a glacier’s patience Smashed every transformer with every trailer'Til nothing was standing Sixty-five miles wide But still you are nowhere, still you are nowhere Nowhere in sight Come out to meet me, run out to meet me Come into the light Climb the boxcars to the engine Through the smoke and to the sky Your rails have always outrun mine, so I Picked them up and crashed them down In a moment close to now Cause I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss How you'd sigh yourself to sleep When I’d rake the springtime across your sheetsWoke a dog from a running dream And that's bad luck Ate a black fly in the cream And that's bad luck Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring And that's bad luck Could have stopped any one of these things But that would have been bad luck Are you tired of things going right Things going wrong Tired of trying to make everyone happy Too tired to sing your own songs Do you wish you could stop everything And take back your love Say you're sorry that you gave it up so easy And cry like you're trying to be born Woke a dog from a running dream And that's bad luck Ate a black fly in the cream And that's bad luck Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring And that's bad luck Could have stopped any one of these things But that would have been bad luckEarly in the mornin' where there used to be a slough There's a tiny business lake, don't let the cattails fool you Down in the bottom where nothing is born Sleeps a silver dollar with your face thereon Wish I could trace the frowning compass of your mouth Drop a Mercury dime down a Roman drain and summon Mars Last lion of Albion They'll use you for centuries to come They'll steal your patents for the sun And you'll feel extinction When you see your face on their money Late in the heavens that are already bought Sleeps a red planet in the galaxy of a lion's thoughts On the surface, every tendon and intended machine Is gonna buckle, knuckle, kneel on a carpet of lion's tongues Wish I could stand in the spray at the cliff of your sweet revenge Ocean of naked serrated marble crushing inHe led you to this hiding place His lightening threats spun silver tongues The red bells beckon you to ride A handprint on the driver's side It looks a lot like engine oil And tastes like being poor and small And popsicles in summer Deep red bells, deep as I have been done Deep red bells, deep as I have been done It always has to come this The red bells ring this tragic hour She lost sight of the overpass But daylight won't remember that When speckled fawns graze ‘round your bones’Who took the time to fold your clothes And shook the Valley of the Shadow Deep red bells, deep as I have been done Deep red bells, deep as I have been doneMy brain makes drugs to keep me slow A hilarious joke for some dead pharaoh But now, not even the masons know What drug will keep night from coming There are so many tools that are made for my hands But the tide smashes all my best-laid plans to sand And there's always someone to say it's easy for me But I revenge myself all over myself There's nothing you can say to me You never held it at the right angle You never held it at the right angle Catch a, catch a, catch a, catch a falling star But wash your hands of it Catch a, catch a, catch a, catch a falling star Because you can't hold it Did they poison my food  Is it cause I'm a girl If I puked up some sonnets, would you call me a miracle I'm gonna go where my urge leads no more Swallowed, waist-deep, in the gore of the forest Arboreal feast, let it finish me, please Cause I revenge myself all over myself There's nothing you can do to meSo the saying says, ""an elephant never forgets""Standing in a concrete cave, swaying sad and insane They walked over the ocean in their dreams they dream awake Until the lights grew dim, until the cop cars came Everybody tells me, this is crazy, yes, I know it I'm a man-man-man, man-man-man-eater But still you're surprised-prised-prised when I eat ya You know they call them killer whales But you seem surprised when it pinned you down To the bottom of the tank, where you can't turn around It took half your leg and both your lungs When I craved I ate hearts of sharks, I know you know it I'm a man-man-man, man-man-man-eater But still you're surprised-prised-prised when I eat ya Yes, I'm a man-man-man, man-man, man-eater But still you're surprised-prised-prised when I eat ya It will end again in bullets fired It will end again in bullets fired"
Johnny Cash,adult alternative artists,10,"The other night dear, as I lay sleeping I dreamed I held you in my arms When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken So I bowed my head and I cried You are my sunshine, my only sunshine You make me happy when skies are gray You'll never know, dear, how much I love you Please don't take my sunshine away I've always loved you and made you happy And nothing else could come between But now you've left me to love another You have shattered all of my dreams You are my sunshine, my only sunshine You make me happy when skies are gray You'll never know, dear, how much I love you Please don't take my sunshine awayI hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle tears a hole The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become My sweetest friend Everyone I know Goes away in the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns Upon my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear You are someone else I am still right hereI hear the train a-comin', it's rolling 'round the bend And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone When I was just a baby, my mama told me, ""Son Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars Well, I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free But those people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures me Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues awayI keep a close watch on this heart of mine I keep my eyes wide open all the time I keep the ends out for the tie that binds Because you're mine, I walk the line I find it very, very easy to be true I find myself alone when each day's through Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you Because you're mine, I walk the line As sure as night is dark and day is light I keep you on my mind both day and night And happiness I've known proves that it's right Because you're mine, I walk the line You've got a way to keep me on your side You give me cause for love that I can't hide For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide Because you're mine, I walk the line I keep a close watch on this heart of mine I keep my eyes wide open all the time I keep the ends out for the tie that binds Because you're mine, I walk the lineLove is a burning thing And it makes a fiery ring Bound by wild desire I fell into a ring of fire I fell into a burning ring of fire I went down, down, down And the flames went higher And it burns, burns, burns The ring of fire The ring of fire I fell into a burning ring of fire I went down, down, down And the flames went higher And it burns, burns, burns The ring of fire The ring of fire The taste of love is sweet When hearts like ours meet I fell for you like a child Oh, but the fire went wildWe got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went out I'm going to Jackson, I'm gonna mess around Yeah, I'm goin' to Jackson Look out Jackson town Well, go on down to Jackson, go ahead and wreck your health Go play your hand you big-talkin' man, make a big fool of yourself Yeah, go to Jackson;

screaming Loud voices behind the wall Another sleepless night for me It won't do no good to call The police Always come late, if they come at all And when they arrive They say they can't interfere With domestic affairs Between a man and his wife And as they walk out the door The tears well up in her eyes Last night I heard the screaming Then a silence that chilled my soul Prayed that I was

breath Cold were his hands on my breast The man that I loved and put to rest He came to me and held me close We danced til dawn in the early snow There I felt him cry and cry""I'll never leave, leave your side""Oh the madness This town thinks I'm mad Sixty years, has it been a dream This man I'm haunted by, I see I'm eighty years and on my bed Awaiting death, that final breath He sits by and looks to me""Soon you will come and be with me""Now I feel all warm inside As I leave this mortal body behind Seems it is eternal's way We're waltzing into heaven's gate"

retard Tu as peut-être raté ton train Tu ne peux peut-être pas me pardonner Les ombres grandissent Et les foules s’effacentDrink up, baby, stay up all night The things you could do, you won't but you might The potential you'll be that you'll never see The promises you'll only make Drink up with me now, forget all about The pressure of days, do what I say And I'll make you okay, drive them away The images stuck in your head People you've been before That you don't want around anymore They push, shove and won't bend to your will I'll keep them still Drink up baby, look at the stars I'll kiss you again between the bars Where I'm seeing you there, with your hands in the air Waiting to finally be caught Drink up one more time and I'll make you mine Keep you apart, deep in my heart Separate from the rest, but I like you the best And keeping the things you forgot"

here So I prayed I could break away I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change And break away Out of the darkness and into the sun But I won't forget all the ones that I love I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change And break awayHey Every kiss is a door Can I knock on yours  Can we knock a

you're in so deep Feels easier to just swim down And so they move uptown And learn to live with the unimaginable I spend hours in the garden I walk alone to the store And it's quiet uptown I never liked the quiet before I take the children to church on Sunday A sign of the cross at the door And I pray That never used to happen before If you see him in the street, walking by himself Talking to himself, have pity You would like it uptown, it's quiet uptown He is working through the unimaginable His hair has gone grey, he passes every day They say he walks the length of the city You knock me

the part But honestly, I'd do it all again Puttin' up with all the bullshit It made me strong enough to do this It used to bother me, thought I could never leave After all that I've been through, nothin' left to prove No, no, no, I don't think about you Weighing down on me I lost my sanity And now that we are through, nothin' left to lose No, no, no, I don't think about you I feel freedom where I stand now And I feel proud of who I am now Yeah, I learned a lot along the way I love the woman that I became"
Tom Cochrane,adult alternative artists,10,"Life's like a road that you travel on When there's one day here and the next day gone Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand Sometimes you turn your back to the wind There's a world outside every darkened door Where blues won't haunt you anymore Where the brave are free and lovers soar Come ride with me to the distant shore We won't hesitate, break down the garden gate There's not much time left today Life is a highway I want to ride it all night long If you're going my way I want to drive it all night long Through all the cities and all these towns It's in my blood and it's all around I love you now like I loved you then This is the road and these are the hills From Mozambique to those Memphis nights The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights Knock

life, he was gonna play in the big league The big league Not many ways out of this cold northern town You work in the mill and get laid in the ground And if you're going to jump it will be with the game Real fast and tough is the only clear lane to the big league My boy's going to play in the big league My boy's going to turn some heads My boy's going to play in the big league My boy's going to knock 'em dead The big league All the right moves when he turned eighteen Scholarship and school on a big U.S  team Out with his girl near Lake Mc Clean Hit a truck doing seventy in the wrong lane To the big league My boy's going to play in the big league My boy's going to turn some heads My boy's going to play in the big league My boy's going to knock 'em deadSo long so long so long he's been away So long so long so long he's back again When I turned seventeen We had passion, we had dreams Thought the love we were fighting for Was something holy, something more When I turned twenty-one We were outside on the run When I walked out with my girl We went halfway around the world CH OR US I dreamed I saw her standing there Running for the boy inside the man I was hit hard by the light so bright it burned All at once I knew she'd understand Boy inside the man The boy inside the man When I turned twenty-five We were hungry, we had drive When I turned much older then When the boy was lost in pride Now I just turned thirty-one I have lost and I have won Still I've kept my dreams alive'Cause the boy will never die CH OR US Ah do you understand CH OR USWaiting by the shoreline In Somalia for your reply I need you to come see me That's no lie The guns are getting closer The sweat pours like dew That fell from the trees in Tripoli In the spring I'm white hot I can't take it anymore I'm white hot By the Somalian shore White hot Yes I'm burning to the core I need rain Cast out from the jungle With no rations or canteen For selling faulty rifles To the thieves in Tanzania Adventures and misfortune Nothing wagered, nothing gained I have wandered through the desert Found the ocean not the rainI'm gonna check my scars at home Gonna cash my chips and roam Gonna walk before you fade to black I'm gonna write a new resume I'm gonna write you off the page Gonna take what we might take away And you might find a brighter day You might find a brighter day Oh, and in another year The pain will disappear And I will look back on this life as if it were a scene In a film somebody made for you and me I wish you well Oh, I wish you well I wish you well She wants to be set free Wants the space to feel love and be angry And I, I watch her bounce off the walls While the chips, they start to fall Then in a little while I see that distant smile returning Just like a ghost in a dream that we had way back when Then she'll turn and smile and say, come again Oh, and in another year The pain will disappear We'll look back on this life as if it were a scene Somebody wrote about you and me Somebody made about you and me Do you remember the night the lights went out All along the promenade It started to rain my coat, your dress got wet We laughed till we almost cried Your spirit was so contageous Our timing really bad You were so outrageous How could we hold back The secret is to know when to stop...The secret is to know when to stop...The secret is to know when to stop...Remembering Do you remember the night that we ran out Out on the English Bay We went out on the water The tow almost pulled us away Man, right there the sparks would fly We'd get into such a mess Our timing really stunk back then We didn't give a damn what they thought, I guess The secret is to know when to stop...The secret is to know when to stop...The secret is to know when to stop...RememberingShe's thinking about the prince and Cinderella And the outlaws, and the hustlers, and the heroes That never seem to fall It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what The outcome of the story is Because in real life I try to tell her It's not like that at all Oh, won't you please just hold out now'Cause there's some things I'd like you to forget When your world is sinking like a sunset Tales of Don Juan, they're very poetic, babe But out on the streets out there The true verse of life is written You know it's really a shame When you've got to let go of all the things you love Like a fighter he really bleeds When he must hang up his gloves No I am not a rock and I can feel it now But for a moment, I'd like to forget That my heart is sinking like a sunsetWalking by the roadside I see my fate written upon it I'm checkin' out the back here Where my race is not run Might hear a thousand harps of heaven Rain down upon her I can't stand and watch While you stand accused We got no regrets Might have seen better times But maybe we ain't been there yet Remember the good times And least you forget Have no regrets Sometimes you might find Like you feel that you're drowning Run for cover like some blown out fuse Remember one thing that you filed that number You can call me up baby you won't be refused Have no regrets Might have seen better times But maybe we ain't been there yet Remember the good times and least you forget Have no regretsHe says you want a brand new start She says that we've grown apart I know a thing or two I speak from the heart Don't insult me with what your friends say After all that we've been through You'd owe that to me like I'd owe that to you So go your own way and in time you'll see Exactly who your best friend was Your wise friends might say This is how we survive But I know in my own mind Can't you see it's a clever disguise This friendly advice We'd come such a long long way I don't give a damn baby what they say Your mind is full of wonders and that's o.k Didn't mean to lay your dreams so low And now you've made your choice I believe in my heart I know you like nobody else I know in my mind in time you'll see Exactly who your real friend was Friendly AdviceI was standing with my paper there Minding my own news For everything that someone said Someone else had a different view I watched the whole thing there Unfold upon my T.V  screen""A new World Order is on its way""Well pass the popcorn please You don't mean to tell me No one here is going to get hurt When there's folks at home who Eat dog food they can't afford a shirt Sure find out real fast who's a sitting duck When it's a Mad mad world Shake your hands and say good luck  It's a     Mad mad world I cannot believe this stuff  It's a     Mad mad world Getting madder every day Mad mad world Get involved and they blow you away Sure find out real fast when you're a sitting duck That it's a mad mad world"

I feel Saw the ghost of Elvis On Union Avenue Followed him up to the gates of Graceland Then I watched him walk right through Now security they did not see him They just hovered around his tomb But there's a pretty little thing Waiting for The King Down in the Jungle RoomWatched it coming up Winslow Down South Park Boulevard Yeah it was looking good from tail to hood Great big fins and painted steel Man it looked just like the Batmobile With my old man behind the wheel Well you could hardly even see him In all of that chrome The man with the plan and the pocket comb But every night it carried him home And I could hear him saying Don't you gimme no Buick Son you must take my word If there's a God in Heaven He's got a silver Thunderbird You can keep your Eldorados And the foreign car's absurd Me I wanna go down In a silver Thunderbird Got up every morning While I was still asleep But I remember the sound of him shuffling around Right before the crack of dawn Is when I heard him turn the motor on But when I got up they were goneBaby I've been searching like everybody else Can't say nothing different about myself Sometimes I'm an angel and sometimes I'm cruel But when it comes to love I'm just another fool Yes I'll climb a mountain I'm gonna swim the sea There ain't no act of God, girl Could keep you safe from me My arms are reaching out Out across this canyon I'm asking you to be my true companion True companion True companion So don't you dare and try to walk away I've got my heart set on our wedding day I've got this vision of a girl in white Made my decision that it's you alright When I take your hand I'll watch my heart set sail I'll take my trembling fingers And I'll lift up your veil Then I'll take you home And with wild abandon Make love to you just like a true companion You are my true companion I got a true companion Whoa, a true companionRock of ages let our song Praise your saving power Thou amidst the raging foes You were our sheltering tower Our sheltering tower Rock of ages let our song Praise thy saving power Thou amidst the raging foes You were our sheltering tower Our sheltering tower Furious they assailed us But thine arm availed us And thy word broke their sword When our own strength failed us And your word broke their sword When our own strength failed us Oh rock of ages, oh yeah Children of the wanderers Whether free, whether free or fettered Wake the echoes, wake the echoes of the songs Where you may be scattered Where you may be scattered Oh yeah Everybody talks about some fateful day And I guess that this was mine I may be here to tell some kind of story But I think it's gonna take a little time See I'm rockin' in a cradle Down the hall somewhere and I am—Lost inside a dream Maybe I am falling Maybe I am flying But I know if I am crying she is Holding me And then the sky broke up And then the rain came down And it washed away everything on the ground Wash it away Wash it away Wash it awayI was sitting with Mary In my dad's blue Valiant Rain was coming down And the radio was playing Mary was talking A million miles a minute I could not hear one word she was saying'Cause I was lost I was gone Listening to Levon In another world Oh, in another place I was lost I was gone Listening to Levon I was looking in Mary's eyes But I was listening to Levon Mary's hair was black That much I remember Mary's skin was smooth I remember that too And she'd open her eyes Sometimes when she kissed me I don't know why she did that Maybe Mary knewI finally see your face In my rear-view mirror With each mile I put between us The road keeps gettin' clearer I only wish that I could make a quiet getaway Probably think I'm fooling myself That I just want to have my fun But leaving you believe me Is the first good deed I've done I'm only want to save you From more heartache if I stay'Cause baby if I, if I, if I were an angel Baby if I, if I, if I were an angel Baby if I, if I, if I were an angel I would have earned my wings today I didn't get a message From anyone on high And I don't get instructions On who to save and why No heavenly connections sent me down this wayI'm writing you this letter from some old hotel I can feel the distance between us From the Spanish Steps to the Liberty Bell I know the angels have seen us They can see us baby They see you down on Seventh Avenue While you're just hanging by a thread And I'm sitting in a lonely room without a view Wishing I was there with you instead Won't you walk through this world with me Walk through the world Over the miles of mystery Walk through this world with me I'm staring out across the rooftops, baby I've seen the writing on the wall Heard a little bit of thunder at the seventh wonder And everything is bound to rise and fall That's allLet's go down to the sound tonight Tide is low and we can walk on water Reel me in under that starry light Just like the fisherman's daughter Baby when the bands and the barkers go home They say that Venus she rises from out of the foam She dances on air and laughs at the moon And watches young lovers in fiery dunes So are you willing to wait for the miracle Willing to wait it through Are you willing to wait for the miracle Or don't you believe they're true There's an old man sitting by the side of the pier He's got his cross and his camera and his bottle of beer He just sits all day and all through the night Praying for a vision or a heavenly light'Cause he's willing to wait for the miracle Willing to wait it through He's willing to wait for the miracle What else is he gonna do What else is he gonna do  I don't know much about you I don't know who you are We've been doing fine without you But we could only go so far Don't know why you chose us Were you watching from above Is there someone there that knows us Said we'd give you all our love Will you laugh just like your mother Will you sigh like your old man Will some things skip a generation Like I've heard they often can Are you a poet or a dancer A devil or a clown Or a strange new combination of The things we've handed down I wonder who you'll look like Will your hair fall down and curl Will you be a mama's boy Or daddy's little girl Will you be a sad reminder Of what's been lost along the way Maybe you can help me find her In the things you do and say And these things that we have given you They are not so easily found Oh but you can thank us later For the things we've handed down The things we've handed down Down, down, down, down, down, down"
Cold War Kids,adult alternative artists,10,"Cheated and lied, broken so bad You made a vow, never get mad You play the game, though it's unfair They're all the same, who can compare First you lose trust, then you get worried Night after night, bar after club Dropping like flies, who woke you up On the front lawn, sprinklers turn on It's not your house, where'd you go wrong First you get hurt, then you feel sorry Flying like a cannonball, falling to the Earth Heavy as a feather when you hit the dirt How am I the lucky one I do not deserve to wait around forever when you were there first First you get hurt, then you feel sorry There comes a time, in a short life Turn it around, get a re-write Call it a dark night of the soul Ticking of clocks, gravity's pull First you get close, then you get worriedAnd when my heart won't break An empty space between my lungs And when my knees won't shake I'll drink to find inspiration'Cause I'm a red blooded man When I can't see behind the sun A supernatural plan Is coming to meet me now Living life with no need for the brakes Something happens when I lean on my mistakes Love is mystical Love will break the chains You might feel invincible And you might be afraid Light in darkness will show you the way Give you the power to believe again'Cause I'm a rational man And I can see how far I've come But I don't know where to stand Or who's coming to meet me nowPeople wonder, people talk We're supposed to settle down How we ever got this far Without our feet touching the ground What time is it now where you are We follow beats with different drums We're looking at the same star It is a talent staying young So why you think we both Run around in circles Walk through fire Nothing hurts us Every mountain you climb takes you further away Overcome a lifetime, every day No, we can't help it We're always restless Now you're wired then you're tired There is never a break You only come alive at the thrill of the chase No, we can't help it We're always restlessI've come here nine times asking you, do not make it ten I'm peelin' off all the armor that protected my skin Apologize, I'm layin' down my ego to rest Could you be mine forever, just in case it exists I think about the old days What we've been through to survive Do we get better with time Tell me I'm wrong Looking back to the start, who we were when we met This box of pictures tells a story, when we fight, we forget And I can barely recognize us, back then we were obsessed Can we cut out this madness and get back to the best Think about the old days What we've been through to survive Do we get better with time Tell me I'm wrong I'm lookin' to you always We follow the same guiding light Passin' like ships in the night Can we hang on Can we hang on I kissed the kids at noon Then stumbled out the room I caught a cab, ran up a tab on Seventh and Flowers Beth's recital, I had to run Missed my son's graduation Punched the Nichols boy for taking his seat He gets all that anger from me Still things could be much worse Natural disasters On the evening news Still things could be much worse We've still got our health My paycheck in the mail I promised to my wife and children I'd never touch another drink as long as I live But even then, it sounds so soothing This will blow over in time This will all blow over in time I'm just an honest man Provide for me and mine I give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations Two weeks paid vacation Won't heal the damage done I need another oneYou can't cut me loose until you show me I told you the truth about the old me And now you use confession as the proof Do what you have to do Go ahead and act the fool What if in the end You want so bad to forgive But you cannot forget So We've been here before I'm so You want something more Lover, best friend, my worst enemy You know I won't let you get away I get you to swerve out of the fast lane You still got champagne running through your veins You dare me to step up and challenge you Neither one of us can stand to lose Stand to loseCareless in our summer clothes splashing around In the muck and the mire Careless in our summer clothes splashing around In the muck and the mire Fell asleep with stains Caked deep in the knees What a pain Now hang me up to dry You wrung me out Too, too, too many times Now hang me up to dry I'm pearly like the white The

heart There's no way You can wait'Til tomorrowToday, we took a walk up the street We picked a flower and climbed the hill above the lake And secret thoughts were said aloud We watched the faces in the clouds Until the clouds had blown away And were we ever somewhere else You know, it's hard to say And I never saw blue like that before Across the sky, around the world You're giving me all you have and more And no one else has ever shown me how To see the world the way I see it now Oh I, I never saw blue like that I can't believe a month ago I was alone, I didn't know you I hadn't seen you or heard your name And even now, I'm so amazed It's like a dream, it's like a rainbow, it's like the rain And some things are the way they are And words just can't explainChina gets broken And it will never be the same Boats on the ocean Find their way back again I am weaving Like a drunkard Like a balloon up in the air I am needing a puncture and someone To point me somewhere I'm gonna keep my head on straight I just hope it's not too late Open up the gate I go straight on I'll steady on Go steady on Steady on Steady on I was feeling imploded A wooden smile, a wooden heart Then things exploded Like rockets in the dark Now I'm pulling out splinters And I'm off to hibernate somewhere For the nuclear winter Of another love affairAll the happy couples on their way to New Orleans Reminding me of when we got along They're only renting time and space to fill up with their dreams And dreams are what they'll have when they have gone How could it be that I was born without a clue to carry on And still it is the same now I am older Armed with just a will and then this love for singing songs And minding less and less if I am colder But I have this funny ache and it's burning in my chest And it spreads just like a fire inside my body Is it something God left out in my spirit or my flesh Would I be saved if I were brave and had a baby It was never clear what would come next but that's the risk and that's the test And you were the only one so far to follow And no one talks about when one might stop and need to rest Or how long you sit alone before you stop looking back It's like you're waiting for Godot And then you pick your sorry ass up off the street and GoAs a little girl I came down to the water With a little stone in my hand It would shimmer and sing And we knew everything As a little girl I came down But in a little while I got steeped in authority Heaven only knows what went wrong There is nothing so cruel Than to bury that jewel When it was mine all along I'm gonna find it'Cause you're shining—I can see you You're smiling—that's enough Oh, I'm holding on to you Like a diamond in the rough Every now and then I can see that I am getting somewhere Where I have to go is so deep I was angry back then And you know I still am Well, I have lost too much sleep I'm gonna find itI'm riding shotgun down the avalanche Uh huh Tumbling and falling down the avalanche Uh huh So be quiet tonight, the stars shine bright On this mountain of new fallen snow But I will raise up my voice into the void You have left me nowhere to go And I love you so much and it's so bizarre A mystery that goes on and on and on And this is the best thing and the very most hard Oh, we don't get along After countless appeals we keep spinning our wheels On this mountain of new fallen snow So I let go the catch and we are over the edge You have left me nowhere to go I'm riding shotgun down the avalancheDown at the train they go to Independence every day But anywhere else now seems like a million miles away And I must have been high to believe That I would ever leave Now I'm just a flat fine line Like the Wichita skyline I rode on the airstream across the great lonesome afternoon And I wished hard enough to hurt, drove fast enough to catch the moon But I must have been dreamin' again'Cause there's nothing around the bend Except for that flat fine line The Wichita skyline Well, as far as Salina I can get that good station from La Rue I'm searching the dial while I'm scanning the sky for a patch of blue And I watch the black clouds roll in Chasing me

You're only just a dreamboat Sailing in my head You swim my secret oceans Of coral blue and red Your smell is incense burning Your touch is silken yet It reaches through my skin Moving from within And clutches at my breast But it's only when I sleep See you in my dreams Got me spinning round and round Turning upside down But I only hear you breathe Somewhere in my sleep Got me spinning round and round Turning upside down But it's only when I sleep And when I wake up from slumber Your shadow's disappeared Your breath is just a sea mist Surrounding my body I'm working through the daytime But when it's time to rest"

Elvis Costello,adult alternative artists,10,"She may be the face I can't forget A trace of pleasure or regret May be my treasure or the price I have to pay She may be the song that summer sings May be the chill that autumn brings May be a hundred different things Within the measure of a day She may be the beauty or the beast May be the famine or the feast May turn each day into a heaven or a hell She may be the mirror of my dreams A smile reflected in a stream She may not be what she may seem Inside her shell She who always seems so happy in a crowd Whose eyes can be so private and so proud No one's allowed to see them when they cry She may be the love that cannot hope to last May come to me from shadows of the past That I'll remember till the day I dieDon't start that talking I could talk all night My mind goes sleepwalking While I'm putting the world to right Call careers information Have you got yourself an occupation Oliver's army is here to stay Oliver's army are on their way And I would rather be anywhere else But here today There was a Checkpoint Charlie He didn't crack a smile But it's no laughing party When you've been on the murder mile Only takes one itchy trigger One more widow, one less white nigga Oliver's army is here to stay Oliver's army are on their way And I would rather be anywhere else But here todayI've been on tenterhooks, ending in dirty looks Listening to

can feel it Down in the pleasure center, hell-bent or heaven sent Listen to the propaganda, listen to the latest slander There's nothing underhand that she wouldn't understand Pump it up until you can

so it scares me to death I can't say anymore than ""I love you""Everything else is a waste of breath I want you You've had your fun, you don't get well no more I want you Your fingernails go dragging down the wall Be careful, darling, you might fall I want you I woke up, and one of us was crying I want you You said: ""Young man, I do believe you're dying""I want you If you need a second opinion as you seem to do these days I want you You can look in my eyes and you can count the waysOh, it's so funny to be seeing you after so long, girl And with the way you look, I understand that you are not impressed But I heard you let that little friend of mine Take off your party dress I'm not going to get too sentimental Like those other sticky valentines'Cause I don't know if you were loving somebody I only know it isn't mine Alison, I know this world is killing you Oh, Alison, my aim is true Well, I see you've got a husband now Did he leave your pretty fingers lying in the wedding cake You used to hold him right in your hand I'll bet he took all he could take Sometimes, I wish that I could stop you from talking When I hear the silly things that you say I think somebody better put out the big light'Cause I can't stand to see you this way Alison, I know this world is killing you Oh, Alison, my aim is trueI was tuning in the shine on the light night dial Doing anything my radio advised With every one of those late night stations Playing songs, bringing tears to my eyes I was seriously thinking about hiding the receiver When the switch broke 'cause it's old They're saying things that I can hardly believe They really think we're getting out of control Radio is a sound salvation Radio is cleaning up the nation They say you better listen to the voice of reason But they don't give you any choice'Cause they think that it's treason So you had better do as you are told You better listen to the radio I wanna bite the hand that feeds me I wanna bite that hand so badly I want to make them wish they'd never seen me Some of my friends sit around every evening And they worry about the times ahead But everybody else is overwhelmed by indifference And the promise of an early bed You either shut up or get cut out They don't wanna hear about it It's only inches on the reel-to-reel And the radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools Tryin' to anaesthetize the way that you feelAs I walk through this wicked world Searching for light in the darkness of insanity I ask myself, is all hope lost Is there only pain and hatred and misery And each time I feel like this inside There's one thing I wanna know What's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding Oh, what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding And as I walk on through troubled times My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes So where are the strong and who are the trusted And where is the harmony, sweet harmony 'Cause each time I feel it slipping away Just makes me wanna cry What's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding Oh, what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding History repeats the old conceits The glib replies, the same defeats Keep your finger on important issues With crocodile tears and a pocketful of tissues I'm just the oily slick On the wind-up world of the nervous tick In a very fashionable hovel I hang around, dying to be tortured You'll never be alone in the bone orchard This battle with the bottle is nothing so novel So in this almost-empty gin palace Through a two-way looking glass, you see your Alice You know she has no sins for all your jealousy In a sense, she still smiles very sweetly Charged with insults and flattery Her body moves with malice Do you have to be so cruel to be callous And now, you find you fit this identikit completely You say you have no secrets, then leave discreetly I might make it California's fault Be locked in Geneva's deepest vault Just like the canals of Mars and the Great Barrier Reef I come to you beyond beliefAlmost blue Almost doing things we used to do There's a girl here and she's almost you Almost All the things that your eyes once promised I see in hers too Now your eyes are red from crying Almost blue Flirting with this disaster became me It named me as the fool who only aimed to be Almost blue It's almost touching, it will almost do There is part of me that's always true Always Not all good things come to an end Now it is only a chosen few I've seen such an unhappy couple Almost me Almost you Almost blueCalling Mister Oswald with the swastika tattoo There is a vacancy waiting in the English voodoo Carving 'V' for vandal on the guilty boy's head When he's had enough of that, maybe you'll take him to bed To teach him he's alive 'fore he wishes he was dead Turn up the T V, no one listening will suspect Even your mother won't detect it So your father won't know They think that I've got no respect But everything means less than zero Hey, red Hey, red Oswald and his sister are doing it again They've got the finest home movies that you have ever seen They've got a thousand variations: every service with a smile They're going to take a little break, and they'll be back after a while Well, I hear that South America is coming into style Turn up the T V, no one listening will suspect Even your mother won't detect it So your father won't know They think that I've got no respect But everything means less than zero"

not too late for that Too late for me I know I've been hurt before And I know I really shouldn't give any more But this time This time things seem just a little different And when I look in your eyes You know I can see that it's true And I hear you sayIt was good for me It was good for you Now nothing either of us can say or do Can change the way you feel tonight Sometimes love just slips out of sight Just one thing before you go Just one thing that you've got to know No one will ever touch me that way The way that you did that very first day And I'll Never be the same without you here I'll live alone Hide myself behind my tears No I'll Never be the same without your love I'll live alone Try so hard to rise above The years go by There's always someone new To try and help me forget about you Time and again it does me no good Love never feels the way that it shouldI was a man Who always played around in love So quick to take But so afraid to give enough But now I've found the one And heaven will only know What only my eyes can say And time can't take away I was a girl Who trusted no one with my heart And the dreams that young girls dream Were just vanishing in the dark But now I've found the one And heaven will only know What only my eyes can say They say That I will  take you  forever And there will never be anyone else In my heart but you And I will take you forever And there will never be anyone else but you Anyone else but youWhat do you think about love Is it a game to be played To be torn and lost in the wilderness To be lost And lonely after all What do you think about love Is it a way to be saved To feel the warmth of another love Just to be lost And lonely after all I really don't know anymore I really can't say I really don't know anymore I'm just that way What do you think about love Is it a game to be played To keep your heart and have never loved To be lost And lonely after all What do you think about love Is it a way to be saved To give up your heart to another love To be lost And lonely after allI never had anything happen so fast Took one look and I shattered like glass I guess I let it show 'cause your smile Told me you knew That you're everything I ever wanted at once There's no holding this heart When it knows what it wants And I never wanted anything more than to know you I was swept away No one in the world but you and I Gotta find a way To make you feel the way that I do I was swept away Without a warning Like night when the morning begins the day I was swept away And so it begins This journey of love The summer wind carries us to places all our own The words of a look The language of touch The way that you want me means so much And I never wanted anything more Than to love youIs it yours Is it mine I was never the kind who could draw the line Are you free Unforgiven Is this the kind of world you could live in It's alright The light is on The darkness has run to hide It's alright The light is on But the darkness is just outside Outside your window Beating down Making the sound of the rain Drive you crazy Make you lazy You know it's only the rain It's alright The light is on The darkness has run to hide It's alright The light is on But the darkness is just outside"

can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leaving Now the days go by so fast And it's one more day up in the canyons And it's one more night in Hollywood If you think that I could be forgiven I wish you would The smell of hospitals in winter And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls All at once, you look across a crowded room To see the way that light attaches to a girl And it's one more day up in the canyons And it's one more night in Hollywood If you think you might come to California I think you should Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after 2 A.M And talked a little while about the year I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower Makes you talk a little lower About the things you could not show herThey paved paradise and put up a parking

eye got poked out in this life Would it be waiting up in heaven with your wife ""God shuffled his feet and glanced around at them;The people cleared their throats and stared right back at him So he said: ""Once there was a boy Who woke up with blue hair To him it was a joy Until he ran out into the warm air He thought of how his friends would come to see And would they laugh, or had he got some

wild beast You can hear the noises at night time They don't have to keep a certain bed time See in the shapes of my body Leftover parts from the apes and monkeys Sometimes when I lie awake I hear the

not long And so I hope when I am finally dead and gone That you'll gather round when I am lowered into the ground If I should die before I wake up I pray that the Lord my soul will take but My body, my body - that's your jobWho put the doggy in the dog house Who put your granny in the granny house Verse 1:Who put the bed in the mad house Who put that junkie in the junk house Chorus:Keep your eye on things while i'm gone...Keep a lid on things Don't you try everything while i'm gone...Keep a lid on things Verse 2:Who put the fun in the fun house Who put your dad in the Half House Who put the

to it Soldiers are gunning us down Should have been done long ago What if you knew her and Found her dead on the ground How can you run when you know You, who are on the road Must have a code that you can live by And so become yourself Because the past is just a good-bye Teach your children well Your father's hell did slowly go by And feed them on your dreams The one they pick's the one you'll know by Don't you ever ask them why If they told you, you would cry So just look at them and sigh And know they love you And you of tender years Can't know the fears That your elders grew by And so please help Them with your youth They seek the truth Before they can die One morning I woke up and I knew You were really gone A new day, a new way And new eyes to see the dawn Go your way, I'll go mine And carry on The sky is clearing and the night Has gone out The sun, he come, the world Is all full of love Rejoice, rejoice, we have no choice But to carry on The fortunes of fables are able To sing the song Now witness the quickness with which We get along To sing the blues you've got to live the dues And carry on Carry on Love is coming Love is coming to us allI will now proceed to entangle the entire area Almost cut my hair It happened just the other day It was gettin' kinda long I could-a said, it was in my way But I didn't and I wonder why I feel like letting my freak flag fly Yes I feel like I owe it to someone Must be because I had the flu for Christmas And I'm not feelin' up to par It increases my paranoia Like lookin' at my mirror and seein' a police car But I'm not givin' in an inch to fear'Cause I promised myself this year I feel like I owe it to someone When I finally get myself together I'm gonna get down in that sunny southern weather And I find a place inside to laugh Separate the wheat from the chaff I feel like I owe it to someoneThere is a town in North Ontario With dream, comfort, memory to spare And in my mind, I still need a place to go All my changes were there Blue, blue windows behind the stars Yellow moon on the rise Big birds flying across the sky Throwing shadows on our eyes Leave us Helpless, helpless, helpless Babe, can you hear me now The chains are locked and tied across my door Babe, sing with me somehow Blue, blue windows behind the stars Yellow moon on the rise Big birds flying across the sky Throwing shadows on our eyes Leave usWell, I came upon a child of God He was walking along the road And I asked him, ""tell me, where are you going ""This he told me Said, ""I'm going down to Yasgur's Farm Gonna join in a rock and roll band Got to get back to the land And set my soul free""We are stardust, we are golden We are billion-year-old carbon And we've got to get ourselves Back to the garden Well, then can I walk beside you I have come to lose the smog And I feel myself a cog In somethin' turning And maybe it's the time of year Yes, and maybe it's the time of man And I don't know who I am But life is for learningFind the cost of freedom Buried in the ground Mother Earth will swallow you Lay your body down Find the cost of freedom Buried in the ground Mother Earth will swallow you Lay your body downFour and twenty years ago I come into this life The son of a woman and a man who lived in strife He was tired of being poor And he wasn't into selling door to door And he worked like the devil to be more A different kind of poverty now upsets me so Night after sleepless night, I walk the floor and I want to know Why am I so alone Where is my woman, can I bring her home Have I driven her away  Is she gone Morning comes the sunrise and I'm driven to my bed I see that it is empty and there's devils in my head I embrace the many colored beast I grow weary of the torment, can there be no peace And I find myself just wishing that my life would simply ceaseWe're gonna do one more song and then we're gonna take a ten minute break and then come back and play electric music and boogie This one is called if you can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with If you're down and confused And you don't remember who you're talkin' to Concentration slips away'Cause your baby is so far away Well there's a rose, in the fisted glove And the eagle flies with the dove And if you can't be with the one you love, honey Love the one you're with Love the one you're with Love the one you're with Love the one you're with Don't be angry, don't be sad Don't sit cryin' over good times you had There's a girl, right next to you And she's just waiting for something to do"

you're feeling warm The temperature could drop away Like four seasons in one day Smiling as the shit comes down You can tell a man from what he has to say Everything gets turned around And I will risk my neck again, again You can take me where you will Up the creek and through the mill Like all the things you can't explain Four seasons in one day Blood dries up Like rain, like rain Fills my cup Like four seasons in one dayTell me all the things you would change I don't pretend to know what you want When you come around and spin my top Time and again, time and again No fire where I lit my spark I am not afraid of the dark Where your words devour my heart And put me to shame, put me to shame When your seven worlds collide Whenever I am by your side And dust from a distant sun Will shower over everyone You're still so young to travel so far Old enough to know who you are Wise enough to carry the scars Without any blame, there's no one to blame It's easy to forget what you

queen and the crown I don't know what tune that the orchestra played But it went by me sickly and sentimental Can I have another piece of chocolate cake Tammy Bakker's got a lot on her plate Can I buy another cheap Picasso fake Andy Warhol must be laughing in his grave The band of the night takes you to ethereal heights over dinner And you wander the streets never reaching the heights that you seek And the sugar that dripped from the violin's bow Made the children go crazy, put a hole in the tooth of a hag Can I have another piece of chocolate cake Tammy Bakker must be losing her faith, yeah Can I buy another cheap Picasso fake Andy Warhol must be laughing in his grave And the dogs are on the road, we're all tempting fate Cars shooting by with no number plates And here comes Mrs  Hairy LegsWhen you come across the sea Me like a beacon, guiding you to safety The sooner the better now And when you come the hills will breathe Like a baby, pulled up Heaving from the bottom of the ocean The sooner the better now And when you come to cover me With your kisses, fresh like a daisy Chained up in a lion's den The sooner the better now I'll know you by the thunderclap Pouring like a rain of blood to my emotions And that is why, I stumble to my knees And why, underneath the Heavens With the stars burning and exploding I know why I could never let you down When you comeYou opened up your door I couldn't believe my luck You in your new blue dress Taking away my breath The cradle is soft and warm It couldn't do me no harm You're showing me how to give Into temptation Knowing full well, the Earth will rebel Into temptation A muddle of nervous words Could never amount to betrayal The sentence is all my own The price is to watch it fail As I turn to go You looked at me for half a second With an open invitation For me to go Into temptation Knowing full well, the Earth will rebel Into temptation Safe in the wide open arms of Hell"

Jim Cuddy,adult alternative artists,10,"There's paper scattered on the lawn Birds up on the line There's letters left unopened here There never is the time There's messages I should return And people I should call I'm still tripping over echoes Left lying in the hall There's a light comes Through the darkness Slowly to my eyes You can fall back here forever I just never realized Time won't let me go And every night I know That you could pull me through You could always pull me through Even when I'm lying here Drowning in my blues You take the sting out of the rain And bring the sun back up again You could always pull me throughSister's got her baby now and I'm glad for what she did But her older one's in trouble, man I really love that kid Maybe he could live here, for us it would be nice He needs some time to grow up, needs a father in his life Me I guess I'm lucky, mine have almost grown It's amazing what they turn into from a seed that we have sown I remember nights just lying there, worrying a while I look across the room now, and I see them and I smile All we ever want at night's our families to be safe So we hold their hands and pick them up until they take their place We know that there's no promises, no no guarantees So we pray and pray and pray at night whatever will be will be Oh look at it coming down, making a mess of this whole town And I think that I know why Everyone watched the wedding, two people in love Two people whose blessing comes from higher up above They're not like you and me, they were destined to be Oh everyone watched the wedding, couldn't get enough At least for one moment we were right there up above Looking down on all the royal fuss Monday we were back upon the bus Driving through the neighbourhoods and factories that are us That one day, hope was all that we could see And they looked so beautiful to me Hope was all that we could see And they looked so beautiful to meLast Friday they had a masquerade Everyone was there All decked out in stars and silver Moonlight in their hair Darkness fell down around us We were lost in the mystery Left our clothes by the side of the road And jumped into the sea Wash me down Wash me down Take me away from the beating drums Let the great world go by Wash me down Wash me down And when you go I will never forget I heard a rumour ‘bout a miracle In a town by the Buffalo Leap People came from miles around To watch the statue weep They filled the square with their caravans Cameras lit up the trees Every time a light went off They fell down to their kneesYou and me we're not much for talking Quiet smiles and silent walking Riding the waves of sunshine in our time I was driving the dream down the West Coast mountains Dropping a coin in every fountain Moving along til you came on my mind But it's all right now That was the way we were There's no sense in changing it now Maybe sometime Maybe sometime Maybe sometime We followed the moon all the way to Golden Slept outside til we were almost frozen Watching the sun come up over Lake Louise Stories will end and we'll never know just why There's never the chance to say good-bye Maybe sometime Maybe sometime Maybe sometimeEveryone knows it, try not to show it This city can bring you down I’m a believer some days are hard, but I couldn’t leave this town I got a skyscraper soul Like a flower that comes where the sun never goes A Skyscraper soul Filling my heart where there once was a hole Look out my window Watching the sun go down On the crowds below I know the struggle Weaving through trouble Life can be hard, I know I got a skyscraper soul There’s mud in my veins and there’s steel in my bones Skyscraper soul Building it all up from water and stones Look through the market stalls Over broken walls To this hollowed ground Looks are deceiving There’s a heart beating Here in this battered townI’m sitting by the window with the echoes in my ears Your footsteps walking down the hall Maybe there were words that could have dried up all our tears I couldn’t find them at all I’ve made up my mind I can’t do this anymore Can’t watch the damage we do I’ve wandered so long wondering where I might belong Cause I know it’s not here with you So sweep me away like the wind blows the leaves Just like the seasons gone by I’m not one of those who can easily go I need to know you’ll be fine I’ve made up my mind I can’t do this anymore Can’t watch the damage we do I’ve wandered so long wondering where I might belong Cause I know it’s not here with you I’ve made up my mind I can’t do this anymore Not after all we’ve been through I can’t risk any more time and it’s always on my mind I know it’s not here with you I’ve mixed up all the memories of the things that we have done Can’t quite believe them anymore And I’m stunned by the beauty of you standing across the room Even as I’m closing the door I’ve made up my mind I can’t do this anymore Can’t watch the damage we do I have wandered so long wondering where I might belong Cause I know it’s not here with you I’ve made up my mind I can’t do this anymore Not after all we’ve been through I can’t risk any more time and it’s always on my mind But I know it’s not here with youStuck out by the highway A cheap hotel room too Lock all the doors and windows Still the desperation's coming through Hard night in Denver You got a friend in New Orleans Sometimes the skylines never look the way they look inside your dreams I don't know where we go from this point on So many hours are lost and days that are gone When you come around again Will I be waiting Well some things are hard to explain Anticipating That loneliness finds a way Of changing your mind Waking up in strange rooms With hours left to kill Write down in a letter all those things you want to do but never will Meet all the djs Remember all the names Lay down your head at night and wonder if tomorrow'll be the same Now as I close my bedroom door I'm hearing your voice on the phone with me wanting moreAt least we had the sense to know what's done is done Now I'm not saying we never had fun We made love like a speeding train but we'd end up back on earth again It oughtta've been easy when we got together Sign all the papers, and on with forever No real reason to drink a lot Well wake up honey, see what we've got Oh my I remember this we don't have any wedding bliss Wake up there's some things we gotta set right Sixteen bottles and a wedding trunk Oughtta be a law against marrying drunk Honey, we got married again last night You always told me we should follow our own minds But that was you staying out late and me always left behind Fussin' and fightin' about the same old stuff Six months in I'd had enough Now I'm waking up here in the blinding heat A ring on my finger in the wedding suite The same old trouble lying next to me With a copy of the license and the registry Oh my I remember that kiss But where do we go after this Wake up there's some things we gotta set right Sixteen bottles and a wedding trunk Oughtta be a law against marrying drunk Honey, we got married again last nightTake me down to the riverside Wash me up from this dusty ride I'll pitch my tent in a field nearby When I see you all my spirit starts to fly Ah the moment comes Somebody jumps somebody waits too long It might never come again Once I saw myself as someone dying to be freed But you have led me here and that's all I need Rolling across this graceful land Phone calls home won't understand Waving flags don't mean that much Not like the thrill you get from a stranger's touch All the world you held The way you see yourself You know that you're bound to change You might never be the same When I look outside I see myself in the fear and greed But you have led me here And that's all I needYou were born on a windswept morn Under the summer sky They moved you past all the kids in your class You never even asked why Oh the golden days Lying awake at night Hearing the ocean spray Nobody counting the lives you've cost No mothers crying for sons they've lost Nobody watching at all Just you and the road as it curves and bends Doing little jobs for your daddy's friends One day when the world is right We're going to walk in the bright blue light When your kingdom's gone And your friends moved on We're going to watch you fall We're going to watch it all One fine day Stuck your hand in a desert land Hoping that liberty shines Counting the sins of the ones you put in Sweeping the roads for mines"

Jamie Cullum,adult alternative artists,10,"Realign all the stars above my head Warning signs travel far I drink instead On my own Oh, how I've known The battle scars and worn out beds Gentle now a tender breeze blows Whispers through a Gran Torino Whistling another tired song Engines hum and bitter dreams grow Heart locked in a Gran Torino It beats a lonely rhythm all night long These streets are old They shine with the things I've known And breaks through the trees Their sparkling Your world is nothing more than all the tiny things You've left behind So tenderly your story is nothing more than what you see Or what you've done Or will become Standing strong Do you belong In your skin Just wonderingAfter years of expensive education A car full of books and anticipation I'm an expert on Shakespeare, and that's a hell of a lot But the world don't need scholars as much as I thought Maybe I'll go traveling for a year Finding myself, or start a career I could work with the poor, though I'm hungry for fame We all seem so different, but we're just the same Maybe I'll go to the gym, so I don't get fat Aren't things more easy with a tight six-pack Who knows the answers, who do you trust I can't even separate love from lust Maybe I'll move back home and pay off my loans Working nine to five answering phones Don't make me live for my Friday nights Drinking eight pints and getting in fightsTruth, truth isn't something I learned I feel like it's something you earn Restless and hungry for future stories Of days where we all live our lives in the graves And the hymns of your heroes of phrase Don't lose your memories prematurely If it's true what they say about love and affection I'll open my eyes to a door that is flowing with Flowing with, flowing with Drink, drinking in all of the sunshine Reminding ourselves that there's no time To wander around in the cold Pain, pain is just part of your day So suck it up, learn how to play And down your first pint of the sunshine stories It's true if it's all over now, baby blue Did you listen when I told you to Live out your life in a blaze of glory It's getting late I'm making my way over to my favorite place I gotta get my body moving Shake the stress away I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way Possible candidate Who knew That you'd be up here looking like you do You're making staying over here impossible Baby I must say your aura is incredible If you don't have to go, don't Do you know what you started I just came here to party Now we're rocking on the dancefloor Acting naughty Your hands around my waist Just let the music play We're hand in hand Chest to chest Now we're face to face I wanna take you away Lets escape into the music DJ let it play I just can't refuse it Like the way you do this Keep on rockin to it Please don't stop the Please don't stop the musicI missed the opportunity To get you babe to stay with me Never thought, I'd regret the excuses that I've made Like a song, it will fade If there's music in the night And it's really, really right It's the only thing I need It intoxicates your mind All your troubles left behind So come on and take my lead It's not just me who feels it Music plays a mind trick Watch me forget about missing you So I put my feelings out to dry Love, one day again I'll have to try Falling out, making up It seems such a silly game Why do I never gain If there's music in the night And it's really, really right It's the only thing I need It intoxicates your mind All your troubles left behind So come on and take my lead It's not just me who feels it Music plays a mind trick Watch me forget about missing youEverybody wants to be a cat Because a cat's the only cat Who knows where it's at Tell me, everybody's pickin' up on that feline beat Cause everything else is obsolete Now a square with a horn Can make you wish you weren't born Every time he plays But with a square in the act You can set music back To the caveman days I've heard some corny birds who tried to sing Still a cat's the only cat Who knows how to swing Who wants to dig A long-haired gig Or stuff like that When everybody wants to be a cat A square with that horn Makes you wish you weren't born Every time he plays oh a rinky, tinky, tinkyYou asked me over and over and over Have you seen my peacock feathered hat If it was under a four leaf clover I'd be on the lawn lookin' for that Where is your heart at  Nobody knows that Even though you've, him, her, me and an army searching I've got a feeling you will be reeling When you are bad and the circus comes to town And you'll see me leaving dressed up As a magician or something like that Your satin and flip-flops are hidden in the Pockets of your velvet dressing gown Your diamond cufflinks are hidden in the Ruffles of your silk white shirt from town Where is your heart at  Nobody knows that Even though you've, him, her, me and an army searching I've got a feeling, you will be reeling When you are bad and the circus comes to town And you'll see me leaving dressed up As a magician or something like that, heyHello innocence Though it seems like we’ve been friends for years I’m finishing How I wish I had never begun Though it should be the last one And it’s dragging me down to my knees Where I’m begging you please Let me go Don’t you know I’m all over it now And I can't say how glad I am about that I’m all over it now‘cause I worked and I cursed and I tried And I said I could change and I lied Where there’s something still moves me inside Yeah She’s a melody That I’ve tried to forget but I can’t It still follows me When I wake in the dead of the night And I know that I can’t fight That song going round in my head Like the last thing she said:Right now the world looks so exciting But that first rung it feels so cold The air up there looks so inviting You'll do the rest when you are old The printed pictures they stain your hands It's like a memory you don't own The architecture of your grand plan Designed to put you on the throne The bitter taste of the unknown I'll tell you for nothing you're not the only one singing singing Trying to bring to life your dreams I'll tell you for nothing you're not the only one who believes I don't know if you're gonna make it How many girls you're gonna know I don't know if you'll pay your dad back With front row tickets to your show Right now your snare drum is a trash can Your bedroom shadows are your stage Your old best friend he is your one fan He'll watch the light inside you fadeKnow this is a universal truth People let you down So reach out for the things that you can use Buried in the ground I think I've been misunderstood Not all of my choices have been good In a fading light So we should put this one to bed Before it bursts out of my head Ready for the fight So when it get's too late And I find my place Who will save your soul and love me here So when it get's too far So well let down your guard Who will save your soul and love me here Inside of another tiny life Full of big ideas Strikes me with the baggage left behind I could dry those tears"

my eyes'Cause boys don't cry Boys don't cryI've been looking so long at these pictures of you That I almost believe that they're real I've been living so long with my pictures of you That I almost believe that the pictures are all I can feel Remembering you standing quiet in the rain As I ran to your heart to be near And we kissed as the sky fell in, holding you close How I always held close in your fear Remembering you running soft through the night You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow And screamed at the make-believe, screamed at the sky And you finally found all your courage to let it all go Remembering you fallen into my arms Crying for the death of your heart You were stone white, so delicate, lost in the cold You were always so lost in the darkI spy with the corner of my little eye Something beginning with ""S""On candy-stripe legs the spiderman comes Softly through the shadow of the evening sun Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead Looking for the victim shivering in bed Searching out fear in the gathering gloom And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room And there is nothing I can do when I realise with fright That the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight Quietly he laughs and shaking his head Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed And softer than shadow and quicker than flies His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light The spiderman is having you for dinner tonight And I feel like I'm being eaten By a thousand million shivering, furry holes And I know that in the morning I will wake up in the shivering cold And the spiderman is always hungryOh, I miss the kiss of treachery The shameless kiss of vanity The soft and the black and the velvety Up tight against the side of me And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed And run in thickening streams of greed As bit by bit it starts the need To just let go my party piece I miss the kiss of treachery The aching kiss before I feed The stench of a love for a younger meat And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep The holding up on bended knees The addiction of duplicities As bit by bit it starts the need To just let go my party piece But I never said I would stay to the end So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy Screaming me over and over and over I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery Songs about happiness murmured in dreams When we both of us knew how the ending would beI've waited hours for this, I've made myself so sick I wish I'd stayed asleep today I never thought this day would end I never thought tonight could ever be this close to me Just try to see in the dark, just try to make it work To feel the fear before you're here I make the shapes come much too close I pull my eyes out, hold my breath and wait until I shake But if I had your faith Then I could make it safe and clean Oh, if only I was sure That my head on the door was a dream I've waited hours for this, I've made myself so sick I wish I'd stayed asleep today I never thought this day would end I never thought tonight could ever be this close to me But if I had your faith Then I could make it safe and clean Oh, if only I was sure That my head on the door was a dreamWhenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am home again Whenever I'm alone with you You

know It's time to move on Even though I'm not ready I've got to be strong And trust where you're heading Even though it's not easy Right now the right kind of love is the love that lets go, go There's

take care of myself, yeah You taught me well I learned from you that I do not crumble I learned that strength is something you choose All of the reasons to keep on believing There's no question, that's a lesson that I learned from you We always don't agree on what is the best way To get to the place that we're going from here But I can really trust you and give you the distance To make your decisions without any fear I'm grateful for all of the times You opened my eyesShe's gotta do what she's gotta do And I've gotta like it or not She's got dreams too big for this town And she needs to

really started to play guitar I definitely wanted to become a musician It was almost impossible because—it was—the dream was so big That I didn't see any chance because I was living in a little town; was studying And when I finally broke away from school and became a musician I thought, ""Well, now I may have a little bit of a chance""Because all I really wanted to do is music And not only play music, but compose music At that time, in Germany, in '69, '70, they had already discotheques So, I would take my car, would go to a discotheque Sing maybe thirty minutes I think I had about seven, eight songs I would partially sleep in the car Because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about Almost two years to survive in the beginning I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the '50s The sounds of the '60s, of the '70s And then have a sound of the future And I said, ""Wait a second, I know the synthesizer Why don't I use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future ""And I didn't have any idea what to do But I knew I needed a click, so we put a click on the 24-track Which then was synced to the Moog Modular I knew that could be a sound of the future But I didn't

Vanessa Daou,adult alternative artists,10,"This is the long tunnel of wanting you Its walls are lined with remembered kisses Wet and red as the inside of your mouth Full and juicy as your probing tongue This is the long tunnel of wanting you This is the long tunnel of wanting you Warm as your belly against mine Deep as your navel leading home Soft as your sleeping cock beginning to stir Tight as your legs wrapped around mine This is the long tunnel of wanting you This is the long tunnel of wanting you Straight as your toes pointing toward the bed As you roll over and thrust your hardness Into the long tunnel of my wanting Straightening out my crooked pastMy love is too much It embarrasses you Blood, poems, babies Red needs that telephone From foreign countries Black needs that spatter the pages Of your white papery heart You would rather have A girl with simpler needs:Lunch, sex, undemanding loving Dinner, wine, bed The occasional blow-job And needs that are never red As gaping wounds But cool and blue as television screens in tract houses Oh my love Those simple girls With simple needs Read my books too They tell me they feel The same as I do They tell me I transcribe The language of their hearts They tell me I translate Their mute, unspoken pain Into the white light of languageYou're on time, I came early Just to see if you'd keep your word After everything I've heard I'm surprised I still have faith Your promise is so easy to break Today was a beautiful day There's just one thing that I'm missing The bittersweetness of your kissing One thing that I'm missing One thing that I'm missing One thing that I'm missing You're the type to mix love with liquid Stir it up into a troubling brew Make me lose my way Take the apple from the snake A habit you taught me Today was a beautiful day There's just one thing that I'm missing The bittersweetness of your kissing One thing that I'm One thing that I'm One thing that I'm missingAll you ask for is a little bit of pain It goes a long way All you wanted was the stinging of her rain Rolling down you face Just like you told her, there's nothing you won't do Crawling comes so easy Now that you're older you will lick her dirty boots Nothing is too sleazy You didn't know what love was You didn't know what pain does Let your arms ache, ache, ache Let your heart break, break, break, break, break All you wanted was the clinging of her vine To wrap around you Now you're dying for a swallow of her brine So she can drown you Gone to heaven, then it's back to hell You're climbing down her staircase All you wanted was to love this Jezebel Even angels make mistakesThe best slave does not need to be beaten, she beats herself Not with a leather whip or with stick or twigs Not with a blackjack or a billyclub but with the fine whip Of her own tongue and the subtle beating of her mind against her mind For who could hate her half so well as she hates herself And who can match the finesse of her self-abuse Years of training are required for this Twenty years of subtle self-indulgence Self-denial until the subject Thinks herself a queen and yet a beggar Both at the same time She must doubt herself in everything but love She must choose passionately and badly She must feel lost as a dog without her master She must refer all moral questions to her mirror She must fall in love with a cossack or a poet She must never go out of the house unless veiled in paint She must wear tight shoes so she always remembers her bondage She must never forget she is rooted in the ground Though she is quick to learn and admittedly clever Her natural doubt of herself should make her so weak That she dabbles brilliantly in half a dozen talents And thus embellishes but does not change our lifeShare your nights and your dreams Share your feelings deep as they may seem Your words may disappear If no one's there to hear Two to tango, two to move All we've got to do is see it through As the day fades away As the day fades away Two to tango when the evening comes And the rain goes with the midnight sun If you find your place Leave behind the troubles that you face Two to tango, two to move And all we've got to do is see it through As the day fades away As the day fades away As the day fades away As the day fades awayShow me your castles in the sky, castles in the sky We can climb there together High above the troubles that can bring us down We can rise forever Show me your secret places behind the world I know Let me in those darker spaces a thousand miles below Show me all your stormy nights when distant thunder rolls Let me feel your desolation in the rain and icy cold Show me the edges of your life tonight'Cause we've got nowhere left to go Show me the freest kind of love tonight All the world will never know, will never know Show me your wilderness, your wanderlusting eyes Tell me all your guilty sins and all your little lies Show me where your island is out on the open sea Tell me where your desert blooms and where your mind runs free Show me the edges of your life tonight'Cause we've got nowhere left to go Show me the freest kind of love tonight All the world will never know, will never knowI sit at home At my desk alone As I used to do On many Sunday afternoons When you came back to me Your arms ached for me And your arms would close me in Though they smelled of other women I think of you on Sunday afternoons I think of you on Sunday afternoons I think of you on Sunday afternoons I think of you on Sunday afternoons Your sweet head would bow Like a child somehow Down to me And your hair and your eyes were wild We would embrace on the floor You see my back's still sore You knew how easily I bruised It´s a soreness I would never loseLiving in a house near the Black Forest Without any clocks she's begun To listen to the walls her neighbours have clocks Not one but twenty clocks apiece Near the black, black forest Near the black, black forest Near the black, black forest Near the black, black forest Listen to the walls, wind your watch Poor love, poor love, have they caught you By the pendulum  Have they got you stopped Have you already gathered how Living near the Black Forest She gets by on cups of borrowed time Near the black, black forest Near the black, black forest Near the black, black forest Near the black, black forestMy dearest Anne, I am living by a lake With a young man, my dearest Anne His beard is red, his eyes flicker His eyes flicker like a cat's eyes He is like no one I know His cock sinks deep in my heart I have owed you a letter For all these months Anne, my dearest Anne Anne, my dearest Anne Anne, my dearest Anne Anne, my dearest Anne Live or die, you said insistently You chose the second and the first chose me Is love the sugar-coated poison That gets us in the end "

Dawes,adult alternative artists,10,"Go I could go on talking or I could stop Wring out each memory 'til I get every drop Sift through the details of the others involved The true crime would be thinking it's just one person's fault Like an honest signature on a fake I DLike the guilty conscience with the innocent plea You can just ignore it, put it out of mind But ain't it funny how the past won't ever let something lie Let's make a list of all the things the world has put you through Let's raise a glass to all the people you're not speaking to I don't know what else you wanted me to say to you Things happen, that's all they ever do In a different time, on a different floor I might mourn the loss of who I'm not anymore So I'm driving out to Oakland for a good look back And a few revisions to my plan of attackWith his back against the San Francisco traffic On the bridge's side that faces towards the jail Setting out to join a demographic He hoists his first leg up over the rail A phone call's made, police cars show up quickly The sergeant slams his passenger door He says, ""Hey son why don't you talk through this with me Just tell me what you're doing it for""""Oh, it's a little bit of everything It's the mountains, it's the fog It's the news at six o'clock It's the death of my first dog""""It's the angels up above me It's the song that they don't sing It's a little bit of everything""There's an older man who stands in a buffet line He is smiling and he's holding out his plate And the further he looks back into his timeline That hard road always led him to today Making up for when his bright future had left him Making up for the fact his only son is gone And letting everything out once, his server asks him""Have you figured out yet, what it is you want ""Late night drives and hot french fries And friends around the country From Charlottesville to good old Santa Fe When I think of you, you still got on that hat that says ""Let’s Party!""I hope that thing is never thrown away I hope that life without a chaperone is what you thought it’d be I hope your brother’s El Camino runs forever I hope the world sees the same person That you’ve always been to me And may all your favorite bands stay together Now I’m just waking up and I’m not thinking clearly so don’t quote me With one eye open, I'm writing you this song Ain’t it funny how some people pop into your head so easily I haven’t seen you in there for so long I hope that life without a chaperone is what you thought it’d be I hope your brother’s El Camino runs forever I hope the world sees the same person that you always were to me And may all your favorite bands stay togetherI will do your interview Try to explain what I'm going through Give you something to read into In a million different ways A sick version of telephone Starts at the clip of the microphone A game we thought we had all outgrown But still everybody plays Ignoring all of the remedies Believing all of the rumors With their endless database I wanna sit with my enemies And say, ""We should have done this sooner""While I look them in the face Maybe that will crack the case I got a friend who's been thinking 'bout Finally kicking her husband out His second life as a talent scout Finally got him caught While she was throwing out all his clothes She heard a voice from beyond the throes""Punish him for the life he chose But forgive the past that he did not""Hey kid at the show tonight--The face beyond the barricade How ya dance and ya sing to every single line Like it was you up on that stage I need to know your secret I'm asking you for help How do I fall in love with anything Like you seem to do so well I gotta get back to when it came out The way it was supposed to sound Before money was ever changing hands And my feet were on the ground When I could feel the wind's direction When I knew what songs to sing And he said, ""Try not to get upset Let it all go by Because how can it be that bad If we're all gonna die ""Soon I started to think about That girl that disappeared And if it really was the road that pulled me away Or if I'm still a victim of my fearsI buckle in my seatbelt and plug my headset in a chair And to the music, I watch flight attendants move They are pointing out the exits, but it looks more like a prayer Or an ancient dance their bloodline reaches through These planes are good for sifting through The warriors from the men I get time to sit and watch them for a while You can see everywhere they're going And everywhere they've been In how they look out at the clouds each time they smile And I think 'maybe he's in town for someone's birthday Or maybe he makes trouble everywhere But as much he resists the conversation Between the rivers and the freeways He knows it's always there'As the Northwest Passage sits somewhere below me as I sleep I dream of captains and explorers eating boots When I ask if I can join them, and they offer one to me I wake up as my home comes into viewI never could admit when I was wrong, man Even when I felt it in my bones I always thought it meant I was a strong man And I wondered why I was alone That's when she stepped out of the ether Right when I was ready for a dance She said 'I don't know what I am doing either But I know when to take a chance'I never knew how to be scared Til I found something I knew I couldn't lose And then a revelation trembled From the tip of my own tongue And like the last few boys at the Alamo Like Cusack holding that stereo Or what Juliet hears from Romeo:""I'm never gonna say goodbye""There's not a way to someone's heart that she can't see She lives and loves with everything she's got My dark days showed me how to ask, ""Why me ""She's shown me how to ask, ""Why not ""If she listens very carefully to a room of conversation She can feel the planet orbiting through space She hears pieces of arguments, beginnings of jokes And the odd lines of a song she cannot place And it all makes up an image that resists interpretation Which is lately how she likes to see herself How she does not believe in accidents, doesn't disagree out loud And falls in love with every man she cannot help And she thinks most people don't talk enough about how lucky they are Most people don't know what it takes for me to get through the day Most people don't talk enough about the love in their hearts But she doesn't know most people feel that same way If she focuses her energies on just walking through the neighborhood With depths and shallows nobody could sound Like January Christmas lights under billion year old stars She comes up with more of what is lost than what is found So by the time that she explains to me Just a glimpse of what she's understood She betrays the meaning putting it in words So she smiles at me lovingly and says, ""Just let me hold your hand So far it's the only way I can let myself be heard""I know all of my exits I'm always planning my escape It's the most aggressive symptom Of this collective phantom pain And the more that you ignore it The more it makes you go insane Just look around It's the battle of the passwords It's the trumpets on the hill It's that constant paranoia It's the final fire drill And if you won't sing the anthem They'll go find someone else who will They're cracking down We're living in the future, so shine a little light It may not make it any better, I'm just hoping that it might I'm not talking about forever, how about just getting through the night We're living in the future, so shine a little light I'm always looking over shoulders Not knowing what I’m looking for Now that the feeling someone's watching Isn't just a feeling anymore Now that both sides of the aisle Are this good at keeping score We've crossed a lineI'm sad about the messages you're sending I'm sad about the shit we're doing wrong I'm sad about the never-ending love we're in We keep pissing on the fire, but it keeps burning so strong Can we both just say ""I love you,"" and get it on Your boy from Birmingham seems nice enough to me But unqualified for you, and your heavy vibes He doesn't know the troubled story that he's written himself into He doesn't know he's just a place for you to hide You wanna tell him ""Best of luck, man Roll Tide""Roll Tide It can't be easier to swim, when the water's high Roll Tide When what we want the most has us terrified Roll Tide If we don't want to let go, then we have to fight Roll Tide Roll Tide I'm asking now for reconciliation I'm asking now for what we have to say I'm asking now for both of us to do a little changing I wanna dance with you forever, in this quantum cabaret If we just allow ourselves, it'll be okay"

call us the human race We've got a history so full of mistakes And we are colored people who depend on a holy grace1, 2, 3, 4 A piece of canvas is only the beginning for It takes on character with every loving stroke This thing of beauty is the passion of an artist's heart By God's design, we are a skin kaleidoscopeThe greatest single cause of atheism in the world today Is Christians who acknowledge Jesus with their lips Then walk out the door and deny him by their lifestyle That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable What if I stumble What if I fall Is this one for the people Is this one for the Lord Or do I simply serenade For things I must afford You can jumble them together My conflict still remains Holiness is calling In the midst of courting fame Cause I see the trust in their eyes Though the sky is falling They need Your love in their lives Compromise is calling What if I stumble What if I fall What if I lose my step And I make fools of us all Will the love continue When my walk becomes a crawl What if I stumble And what if I fall I keep trying to find a life On my own, apart from you I am the king of excuses I've got one for every selfish thing I do What's going on inside of me I despise my own behavior This only serves to confirm my suspicions That I'm still a man in need of a savior I wanna be in the Light As you are in the Light I wanna

Death Cab for Cutie,adult alternative artists,10,"Love of mine, someday you will die But I'll be close behind, I'll follow you into the dark No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white Just our hands clasped so tight, waiting for the hint of a spark If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied Illuminate the ""no""s on their vacancy signs If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks Then I'll follow you into the dark In Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black And I held my tongue as she told me, ""Son Fear is the heart of love,"" so I never went back If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied Illuminate the ""no""s on their vacancy signs If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks Then I'll follow you into the dark You and me have seen everything to see From Bangkok to Calgary and the soles of your shoes Are all worn down, the time for sleep is now But it's nothing to cry about 'cause we'll hold each other soon In the blackest of roomsThe Atlantic was born today, and I'll tell you how The clouds above opened up and let it out I was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere When the water filled every hole And thousands upon thousands made an ocean Making islands where no island should go, oh no Most people were overjoyed, they took to their boats I thought it less like a lake and more like a moat The rhythm of my footsteps crossing flatlands to your door Have been silenced forevermore The distance is quite simply much too far for me to row It seems farther than ever before, oh no I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closerAnd it came to me then that every plan Is a tiny prayer to Father Time As I stared at my shoes in the I CU That reeked of piss and 409 And I rationed my breaths as I said to myself That I'd already taken too much today As each descending peak on the L CD Took you a little farther away from me Away from me Amongst the vending machines and year-old​ magazines In a place where we only say goodbye It stung like a violent wind that our memories depend On a faulty camera in our minds And I knew that you were a truth I would rather lose Than to have never lain beside at all And I looked around at all the eyes on the ground As the T V entertained itself'Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room Just nervous paces bracing for bad news And then the nurse comes 'round and everyone lifts their head But I'm thinking of what Sarah said That love is watching someone dieI want to live where soul meets body And let the sun wrap its arms around me, and Bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing And feel, feel what it's like to be new'Cause in my head, there's a Greyhound station Where I send my thoughts to far-off destinations So they may have a chance of finding a place where They're far more suited than here Ba-da ba-da-ba-ba Ba-da ba-ba-ba-da-ba-ba Ba-da ba-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-da-ba And I cannot guess what we'll discover When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels But I know our filthy hands can wash one another's And not one speck will remain And I do believe it's true That there are roads left in both of our shoes But if the silence takes you, then I hope it takes me too So, Brown Eyes, I'll hold you near'Cause you're the only song I want to hear A melody softly soaring through my atmosphereAnd when I see you, I really see you upside down But my brain knows better, it picks you up and turns you around Turns you around, turns you around If you feel discouraged that there's a lack of color here Please don't worry, lover, it's really bursting at the seams From absorbing everything, the spectrums A to Z Ahh-ahh, ahh-ahh Ahh-ahh, ahh-ahh, ahh-ahh This is fact, not fiction, for the first time in years And all the girls in every girly magazine can't make me feel Any less alone, I'm reaching for the phone To call at 7:03 And on your machine I slur a plea for you to come home But I know it's too late And I should have given you a reason to stay Given you a reason to stay Given you a reason to stay Given you a reason to stay Digging for gold in my neighborhood Where all the old buildings stood And they keep digging it down and down So that their cars can live underground The swinging of a wrecking ball Through these lath and plaster walls Is letting all the shadows free The ones I wish still followed me Followed me, followed me Followed me, followed me I remember a winter's night We kissed beneath the street lamp light Outside our bar near the record store That have been condos for a year and more Now that our haunts have taken flight And been replaced with construction sites Oh, how I feel like a stranger here Searching for something that's disappearedThere is whiskey in the water And there is death upon the vine There is fear in the eyes of your father And there is ""yours"" and there is ""mine""There is a desert veiled in pavement And there's a city of seven hills All our debris flows to the ocean To meet again, I hope it will How could something so fair be so cruel When this black sun revolved around you There is an answer in a question And there is hope within despair And there is beauty in a failure And there are depths beyond compare There is a role of a lifetime And there's a song yet to be sung And there's a dumpster in the driveway Of all the plans that came undoneThis is the moment that you know That you told her that you loved her, but you don't You touch her skin, and then you think That she is beautiful, but she don't mean a thing to me Yeah, she is beautiful, but she don't mean a thing to me I spent two weeks in Silver Lake The California sun cascading down my face There was a girl with light brown streaks And she was beautiful, but she didn't mean a thing to me Yeah, she was beautiful, but she didn't mean a thing to me I wanted to believe in all the words that I was speaking As we moved together in the dark And all the friends that I was telling, all the playful misspellings And every bite I gave that left a mark When tiny vessels oozed into your neck and formed the bruises That you said you didn't want to fade But they did, and so did I that day All I see are dark grey clouds In the distance, moving closer with every hour So when you ask, ""Is something wrong ""I think, ""You're damn right there is, but we can't talk about it now""No, we can't talk about it nowI roll the window down, and then begin to breathe in The darkest country road and the strong scent of evergreen From the passenger seat as You are driving me home Then looking upwards, I strain my eyes and try To tell the difference between shooting stars and satellites From the passenger seat as You are driving me home""Do they collide "" I ask, and you smile With my feet on the dash, the world doesn't matter When you feel embarrassed, then I'll be your pride When you need directions, then I'll be the guide For all time For all timeThe glove compartment is inaccurately named And everybody knows it So I'm proposing a swift, orderly change'Cause behind its door There's nothing to keep my fingers warm And all I find are souvenirs from better times Before the gleam of your taillights fading east To find yourself a better life I was searching for some legal document As the rain beat down on the hood When I stumbled upon pictures I tried to forget And that's how this idea was drilled into my head'Cause it's too important to stay the way it's been But there's no blame for how our love did slowly fade And now that it's gone, it's like it wasn't there at all And here I rest, where disappointment and regret Collide, lying awake at night"

Spending all your money on the whores and hounds Oh-ohhhhh You had a charming air, all cheap and debonair My widowed mother found so sweet And so she took you in, her sheets still warm with him Now filled with filth and foul disease As time wore on, you proved a debt-ridden drunken mess Leaving my mother a poor consumptive wretch Oh-ohhhhh And then you disappeared, your gambling arrears The only thing you left behind And then the magistrate reclaimed our small estate And my poor mother lost her mind Then, one day in Spring, my dear sweet mother died But before she did, I took her hand as she, dying, cried:Oh-ohhhhhWhen we arrive Sons & daughters We'll make our homes on the water We'll build our walls aluminum We'll fill our mouths with cinnamon now These currents pull us 'cross the border Steady your boats Arms to shoulder'Til tides all pull Our hull aground Making this cold harbour now home Take up your arms Sons and daughters We will arise from the bunkers By land, by sea, by dirigible We'll leave our tracks untraceable now When we arrive Sons and daughters We'll make our homes on the water We'll build our walls aluminum We'll fill our mouths with cinnamon We'll make our

with a succulent breast or a thigh Alright, diplomacy happens at nightI alight like a whisper I alight with the lights out And it won't take me long just to find you And it won't take me long just to find you I'm allied to the winter But don't you get clever Don't you get clever I'm allied to the landslide Gonna leave you all severed Gonna leave you all severed I alone am the answer I alone will make wrongs right But in order to root out the cancer It's got to be kept from the sunlight I'm allied to the winter But don't you get clever Don't you get clever I'm allied to the landslide Gonna leave you all severed Gonna leave you all severedAnd here I dreamt I was a soldier And I marched the streets of Birkenau And I recall in spring The perfume that the air would bring To the indolent

feet And we were free to goI want you, thin fingers I wanted you, thin fingernails And when you bend backwards I wanted you, I needed you Oh-oh, to make me better I'll love you in springtime I lost you when summer came And when you pulled backwards I wanted to, I needed to Oh-oh, to make me better Oh-oh, to make me better But we're not so starry-eyed anymore Like the perfect paramour you were in

Down by the water and Down by the old main drag I was just some tow-head teen Feeling round for fingers to get in between Down by the water and Down by the old main drag The season rubs me wrong The

was wedded and it whetted my thirst Until her womb start spilling out babies Only then did I reckon my curse Alright, alright, alright Alright, alright, alright First came Isaiah with his crinkled little fingers Then came Charlotte and that wretched girl Dawn Ugly Myfanwy died on delivery Mercifully taking her mother along Alright, alright, alrightMy true love went riding out in white and green and gray Past the pale of Offa's wall where she was won't to stray And there she came upon a white and wounded fawn Singing, ""Oh, the hazards of love""She, being full of charity, a credit to her sex Sought to right the fawn's hind legs when here her plans were vexed The taiga shifted strange, the beast began to change Singing, ""Oh, the hazards of love""Singing, ""Oh, the hazards of love""You'll learn soon enough The prettiest whistles won't wrestle the thistles undone, undone Fifteen lithesome maidens lay alone in their bower Fourteen occupations paid to pass the idle hour But Margaret heaves a sigh, her hands clasped to her thigh Singing, ""Oh, the hazards of love""Singing, ""Oh, the hazards of love.""You'll learn soon enough The prettiest whistles won't wrestle the thistles undone, undone Undone, undone, undone"

heart pretty baby Is it aching with some nameless need Is there something wrong and you can't put your finger on it Right then, roll to me And I don't think I have ever seen a soul so in despair So if you want to talk the night through Guess who will be there So don't try to deny it pretty baby You've been down so long you can hardly see When the engine's stalled and it won't stop rainingSo you're in love with someone else Someone who burns within your soul And it looks like I am the last to know I hear you've never felt so alive So much desire beyond control And as usual I am the last to know The last to know how you're feeling The last to know where you are The last to know if you're happy now Or if he's treating you like I treated you Or if he's cruel I'll be the last to know We spent summers up beyond the bay And you said these are such perfect days That if the bomb drops baby I wanna be the last to know But now you're living up behind the hill And though we share the same city and feel the same sun When your winter comes I'll be the last to know Always the last to know how you're feeling The last to know where you are The last to know if you're happy now Or if he's pleaded with you Like I pleaded with you if you go Don't let me be the last to know Don't let me be the last to knowHey, I'm with you, let me just get you a light And if we had thought to listen We might have checked if the weather was right And I don't mind if you want to drive all day Hey, it's raining, I should have brought my coat And sometimes I could sell my soul Just to sit and watch you smoke And I don't mind if you want to break my heart'Cos you can burn paper You can turn a wheel But you can't change later Here and now just how good we can feel Hey, stop talking, think I can hear the sea Did I tell you the sound of the surf Makes strange things happen to me And I don't mind if you want to crash the car'Cos you can turn traitor You can turn on your heels But you can't change later Here and now just how good we can feel And hey, don't worry, so that black cat's some kind of curse'Cos if bad times are coming up ahead Just put us in reversePost office clerks put up signs saying 'position closed'And secretaries turn off typewriters and put on their coats And janitors padlock the gates For security guards to patrol And bachelors phone up their friends for a drink While the married ones turn on a chat show And they'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow Gentlemen time please, you know we can't serve anymore Now the traffic lights change to stop, when there's nothing to go And by five o'clock everything's dead And every third car is a cab And ignorant people sleep in their beds Like the doped white mice in the college lab And nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all The needle returns to the start of the song And we all sing along like before And we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow Telephone exchanges click while there's nobody there The Martians could land in the car park and no one would care Closed-circuit cameras in department stores Shoot the same movie every day And the stars of these films neither die nor get killed Just survive constant action replayTell her not to go I ain't holding on no more Tell her something in my mind freezes up from time to time Tell her not to cry I just got scared, that's all Tell her I'll be by her side, all she has to do is call Tell her the chips are down I drank too much and shouted it aloud Tell her something in my heart Needs her more than even clowns need the laughter of the crowd Tell her what was wrong I sometimes think too much But say nothing at all Tell her from this high terrain, I am ready now to fall Tell her not to go I ain't holding on no more Tell her nothing if not this: all I want to do is kiss her Tell her something in my mind freezes up from time to timeSo long, go on and do your best Let all France have whiskey on its breath The world may not be shaking yet but you might prove them wrong Even long shots make it So go then, out into history And show them how easy it can be And you might not believe it yet but pretty soon you'll see Even long shots make it Just don't come home too soon Just don't come home too soon I don't care what people say We can laugh it all away If I have a dream at all it's that for once you won't be on that stupid plane And the world may not be shaking yet But you might prove them wrong Even long shots make it Just don't come home too soon Just don't come home too soon I don't care what people say We're gonna laugh it all awayYou can't go back Honey that is what they told me And you know what I think of that'Cause I'm back here at your side Were you lonely Were you eaten up inside thinking""If only we'd try""You can't go back A fact that nobody could hold me So I've come back round And I'm holding you to this That thing between us That we knew was something special And it seems it still is They can't destroy us We put the seal on it So be joyous 'cause once the fuse is lit You can't go back You can't go back You can't go back Honey that is what they told us And I know what you think of that You made it pretty clearI shouted at the moon But my love gets hit by a lampoon And I'm just waiting for my mockingbird to copy me now She shoots straight from the throat Under my gate over the moon And I'm just waiting for my mockingbird to copy me now Once I get the pills inside me She'll follow through She'll lie like a fresh kill beside me Swallow what I do I'll drink this phantom at my leisure And she'll mimic me measure for measure But I'm just waiting for my mockingbird to copy me now Mockingbird, copy me now Baby, copy me now Baby, copy me nowDriving through the long night Trying to figure who's right and who's wrong Now the kid has gone I sit belted up tight She sucks on a match light, glowing bronze Steering on And I might be more a man if I stopped this in its tracks And said, come on, let's go home But she's got the wheel And I've got nothing except what I have on When you're driving with the brakes on When you're swimming with your boots on It's hard to say you love someone And it's hard to say you don't Trying to keep the mood right Trying to steer the conversation from The thing we've done She shuts up the ashtray, I say it's a long way back now, hon She just yawns And we might get lost some place So desolate that no one where we're from would ever come But she's got the wheel and I've got to deal from now onI still don't believe it, how much we lied Last night you made it with him now I'm supposed to be dignified Just like a man Well I spend my night-times drinking and you spend your days in bed And I guess it's up to us to choose the methods by which we forget And just like a man he holds you gently And just like a man he strokes your hair And just like a man I still pretend that I'm Immune to the whole affair But I wanna die, I wanna cry, I wanna tell you that I was wrong Yeah I wanna die, I wanna cry but it's too late So I soldier on just like a man I don't believe it, you were easy to leave but now I do my best to relieve it in the only way that I know how Just like a man And I don't wanna possess you, and I don't wanna take his place But I don't wanna see my last few pleasures written all over his face And just like a man he holds you gently And just like a man he strokes your hair And just like a man I still pretend that I'm Immune to the whole affair"

to prove If there's a God in my head Then there's a devil too How can I tell the difference When they both claim to be true Maybe God is God Maybe the Devil is me Well, I just throw my chains on And tell myself that I'm free Chains, are they really there Is this just in my head Well, I'll just stay in bedToo much talk 'bout myself Drags me straight into hell Finally hearing from you Pulls me back off the rail You don't expect apologies You always see the best in me I'm the lucky fool that you married It always starts out as friends You always had my respect They all warned you 'bout me Don't give your heart to a wreck And when we're out on the run Drive into the setting sun My heart beats for only you My heart beats for only you My heart beats for only you My heart beats for only you My

sun fell, another night began Shots rang out, all the people ran Confident in our innocence Promises out in the wilderness I know I said I would I know I said I would The martyred sons of a forgotten fit Bend a knee for your favorite So foolish in their innocence Promises out in the wilderness I know I said I would I know I said I would Hold my end, hold my end up, hold my end Hold my end, hold my end up, hold my end It's not too late to turn your back on them What kind of friend would lead you to your death As the chill finally hit your skin Your accomplice turned you in Juliet, you had your reasons Migraine hallucinations Had no way to define The start and the stop of your Freudian mind I believed you when you said God told you what to do But the God inside your head was wrong Fell in to a passionate clique Only way to truth is isolation Patriarch, patriarch, tell me what to do Patriarch, I must follow through Oh, the light shaking on the floor Speaking tongues of angels Surely I must be in the right Oh, this tempest loves to fight Blood bath on the John Muir trail And the hiker recalled the tale Juliet and her friend stood at the edge Juliet jumped without restraint Her friend fell back, lost faith Without a God to blameBrothers hold the line till we got something This world is way too small to feel like nothing I was found near the train tracks looking so homeless at you You came like a copper, you said, ""Son, it's time to move""My love is coming I can barely, hardly wait around When my mother left the bat was the only one here He is just a reason why I'm still here My mother's well spoken, no I didn't get that gene But yes, I lost it, and yes, my eyes they are green My love is coming I can barely, hardly wait around Well if you hide your questions there's no answer I finally found the cure for my own cancer, yeah My love is coming I can barely, hardly wait My heart is thumping, I can feel it more with every beat My love is coming I can barely, hardly wait around"

where to act She said, ""I've lost control again""And she turned around and took me by the hand And said, ""I've lost control again""And how I'll never know just why or understand She said, ""I've lost control again""And she screamed out, kicking on her side, and said""I've lost control again""And seized up on the floor, I thought she'd die She said, ""I've lost control""She's lost control

the monster mash And most of the taxis and most of the whores Are only taking calls for cash, mmm I don't know how it happened It all took place so quick But all I can do is hand it to you And your latest trick Well now, my door was standing open Security was laid back and lax But it was only my heart got-a broken You must have had a pass key made out of wax You played robbery with insolence And I played the blues in twelve bars down on Lovers' Lane And you never did have the intelligence to use The twelve keys hanging off of my chainA long time ago came a man on a track Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back And he put down his load Where he thought it was the best He made a home in the wilderness He built a cabin and a winter store And he plowed up the ground by the cold lake shore And the other travelers came walking down the track And they never went further, no They never went back Then came the churches, then came the schools Then came the lawyers, and then came the rules Then came the trains and the trucks with their loads And the dirty old track was the telegraph road Then came the mines, then came the ore Then there was the hard times, then there was a war Telegraph sang a song about the world outside Telegraph road got so deep and so wide Like a rolling riverBaby, I see this world has made you sad Some people can be bad The things they do, the things they say But baby, I'll wipe away those bitter tears I'll chase away those restless fears That turn your blue skies into grey Why worry, there should be laughter after pain There should be sunshine after rain These things have always been the same So why worry now Why worry now Baby, when I get down I turn to you And you make sense of what I do I know it isn't hard to say But baby, just when this world seems mean and cold Our love comes shining red and gold And all the rest is by the wayHere I am again in this mean old town And you're so far away from me And where are you when the sun go down You're so far away from me You're so far away from me You're so far I just can't see You're so far away from me You're so far away from me, alright I'm tired of being in love and being all alone

a dancer, where its forever ten minutes to two At last call, she swoons to an old rain dog tune, there'll be love to be made here now So I will lie here awake in my bed, until the children have all gone to play, then for two precious hours I will dream of a world where there's love to be made here now There's love to be made here now What of the girl in the painting, where did her dear heart go Off in the hills with her fear and her wonder There's no love to be made here now Where is the boy in the plate glass, where did his body go He gave it away to a north country harlot, there's no love to be made here now There's no love to be made here nowKeep her away from me Keep her away from me'cause I'm not man enough to keep my hands where I can see them I did the wrong brother, just like my mother do That's why I don't have your name, but I got the same eyes as you I got the same eyes..  can't get your money backOne day you're gonna miss me One day you're gonna wake up cold Then you'll

have all your records back You can have an opinion or a heart attack'cause if you lose a kindred spirit, you'll find another one But you've gotta to pull the trigger to have a smoking gun Oh my girl, it must be so tight in your skin 'cause there's no room to breathe- this fantasy you're living in I need a new perpective, I need a fresh start I need a girl like you like a stolen car because we all love the joyride until you wind up dead You see, you don't need a heart to have a swollen headVladivostok bathing in the midnight sun Atlantis up on my dry docks, and fish with guns A monkey takes the reins of th an empire  with daddy's gold bananas, he's a monarch The winds of change are so pollute I'm afraid there's nowhere left to turn With paradise paved and the starts ablaze, the captain turns the no smoking sign off, it doesn't matter, we're going down Now, smoke, people..  burn the last one down Shall I exercise my right to disapprove of all your tricks by calling on the brotherhood to

was green, greener than the hill Where flowers grew and the sun shone still Now I'm darker than the deepest sea Just hand me down, give me a place to be And I was strong, strong in the sun I thought I'd see when day was done Now I'm weaker than the palest blue Oh so weak in this need for youPlease beware of them that stare They'll only smile to see you while your time away And once you've seen what they have been To win the earth just won't seem worth your night or your day Who'll hear what I say Look around, you'll find the ground Is not so far from where you are, but don't be too wise For down below they never grow They're always tired and charms are hired from out of their eyes Never a surprise Take your time and you'll be fine And say a prayer for people there Who live on the floor And if you see what's meant to be Don't name the day or try to say It happened before Don't be shy, you learn to fly And see the sun when day is done, if only you see Just what you are beneath a star

bar And travelling far in sin Sailing downstairs to the northern line Watching the shine of the shoes Hearing the trials of the people there Who's to care if they lose Take a look, you may see me on the ground For I am the parasite of this town Dancing a jig in a church with chimes A sign of the times today Hearing no bell from the steeple tall People all in dismay Falling so far on a silver spoon Making the moon for fun Changing a robe for a size too small People all get hung Take a look, you may see me coming through For I am the parasite who travels two-by-twoI never felt magic crazy

you love me for my money Would you love me for my head Would you love me through the winter Would you love me 'til I'm dead Oh, if you would and you could Come blow your horn on high I never felt

Jakob Dylan,adult alternative artists,10,"Well, I made a promise to not let go Our tug of war has only made me want you more Now steeped in hard luck and doomed to roam My love is braver than you know My forefathers, they worked this land And I was schooled in the tyranny of nature's plans And dressed in thunder, a cloud came around Oh, in the shape of a lion, a hand came down Now, damn this valley and damn this cold Well, it takes so long to let me know It's plant, and reap, and plow, and sow But tell me, will it grow Dig my ditches in the golden sun And I'd be robbing these trains if I could catch me one Now, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday's gone And got me stone-cold sober in a drought so long Boarded mansions and ghost-filled yards Now, there's a boy in a water-tower counting cars Steel trap open and empty stalls Now, there's a well-worn saddle, but the horse is goneI got my window open wide I got my window open wide I got a good woman by my side Got a good woman by my side Now, this kind of day has no night Yeah, this kind of day has no night And I ain't got much on my mind Now, I ain't got much on my mind'Cause I know something good this way comes Now, watching the streets filling up I'm watching the streets filling up In the shade of the summer sun In the shade of the summer sun Got sweet apple pie on the stove Got sweet apple pie on the stove The birds, they're all flyin' low The birds, they're all flyin' low'Cause they know something good this way comes Yeah, something good this way comesThere's a world where I can go and Tell my secrets to In my room In my room In this world I lock out all my Worries and my fears In my room In my room I do my dreaming and my scheming Lie awake and pray Do my crying and my sighing Laugh at yesterday Now it's dark and I'm alone But I won't be afraid In my room In my room In my room We'd feel much better If we sunk this treasure And we laid our armor down Now, these precious metals These captain's letters Are no use to us now Oh, in the day, we struggle with fatigue Much greater than any offer was We bow down and worship These bandits and cowboys Unable to hold their own guns Now, I know that soldiers are not paid to think But something is making us sick Onward and steady, able and young In the valley of the low, low sun Oh, in the shade, we wander Along a highway shoulder Out into the back of beyond Burning the daylight Into a pastime That's too wise to come more than once Oh, it's boom, boom, thunder Ain't no sleep coming out Mining a slippery world Of snow covered beaches Junkyards of diesel And bombers named after girlsI been walking the dirt floor, my eyes are open Lord Where did you go, have we just left you bored On down this unholy well we rolled Stirring barrels in hell to be warm It's further back down than the high ground It ain't milk and honey we're moving 'round Only one thing is certain And that's everybody Everybody's hurting Now we come from the country where the rain follows plow And the evenings are cold enough to pluck your feathers out We hear your engines roaring deep and loud As we work the mules on this bludgeoned ground We've hunted these hills dry We've long outlasted the winter and our last wood pile Only one thing's certain And that's everybody Everybody's hurtingMother, you saw my eyes On the Fourth of July Under a banner of Roman candles Mother, war is kind Like hell, but I am fine Brother, have you gone west You followed through once yet You are still younger, how dare you forget Brother, war is best In the morning, when you've had rest Like a lost dog between houses In the unknown open country You line up at dawn to see who's missing My age is a metaphor That only speaks of everything before Daughter, you wear my name Those are my eyes, keep 'em raised I may have scars but I give more than I take Daughter, war is safe Where you are far awayNothing but the whole wide world to gain Nothing, nothing Got nothing but the whole wide world to gain Nothing, nothing Got nothing but the whole wide, whole wide world to gain I'm here on the blacktop, the sun in my eyes Women and country on my mind Bolting me out over the borderline Now there's no more love lost and no more shame No more digging holes or graves Nothing to lose but rivets and chains Got nothing but the whole wide world to gain Nothing but the whole wide world to gain Nothing, nothing Got nothing but the whole wide world to gain Nothing, nothing Got nothing but the whole wide, whole wide world to gain Was born in a stable and built like an ox Down in the pastures I learned how to walk Mama, she raised me to sing and just let 'em talk Said no rich man's worth his weight in dust Bury him down same as they'll do to us God wants us busy, never giving up He wants nothing but the whole wide world for usEvery time I see you smile Now, come to me, now don't be long Let me tell you how my heart goes wild Please let me love you and it won't be wrong Every time you're in my arms Come to me, don't be long You know that I'll never do you harm Please let me love you and it won't be wrong Let me love you and then you'll see Now come to me, come to me Let me show

and sooner than planned Oh, in the spitting image of a man Raised by wolves on the fat of the land Clear romance beauty and damned Tomorrow will come if she can Just want a woman who can walk on a wire With a trembling glass in her hand Over the hilltops, the fire engine rolls Down the valley, deeper still, it goes Got my weapons out, and I'm laying low On this end of the telescope Alone, you ramble the whole of the world Through black water jungles for bliss Well, it's feast or famine, you eat what you kill There's no need to bring God into this My heart is heavy and pressed to the bone Some people too heavy to hold Now, salutations, take me as I am You can have me or leave me aloneDown from the mountain out walking the flood I see the future in this setting sun Unfolded gardens uncover the earth as it was Filled with canteens and tear gas from this last voyage of us Ain't no gentlemen here hiding wings The devil himself would be puzzled to give Any reasons to sink his fingers in All this voodoo and black magic doing the work that was his With battle songs filling their lungs Move them out down under the sun Give 'em tears for cherry red blood Stack 'em old, we cradle them young World is crazy or maybe just holy rollers for love Now split this ocean set these sails It's down to the seabed we dazzle and fail Hereafter's bringing more funerals than fairs And it's a book of blank maps that we're using to get us there Now through the hilltops my daughter, my son The rescue's too little to cover the slums Cross this river deeper than it ever was There's a pause in the evening when prayers are supposed to be done"
Justin Townes Earle,adult alternative artists,10,"Lord, I'm going uptown To the Harlem River to drown Dirty water gonna cover me over And I'm not gonna make a sound I'm on a roll, mama, I gotta go Gotta get there while I still can Troubled days are behind me now And I know they're gonna let me in When you see me walking up the F DR Just a-singing and a-clapping my hands Tell my mama I love her, tell my father I tried Give my money to my baby to spend'Cause Lord, I'm going uptown To the Harlem River to drown Dirty water gonna cover me over And I'm not gonna make a sound Good times come and they go Even a good man'll break He'll let his troubles bury him whole Even though he knows what's at stakeI swear I see her in my dreams sometimes Held up in the middle of the night Shakin like a pistol in a young mans hand There in the pale moonlight Standin up the top of that lonely hill Spared by the company mines Is my blue eyed baby with her best dress on In the shadow of a lonely pine It was back before the war When the company came These hills grew wild and free Me and baby we'd hide in the hollers low Away from the cruel sun's heat But then they knocked down the timber And burned off the brush To get to the riches below And when they pulled out They left a cold black ground And one pine standing lone So take me home...Lone pine hill I signed up back in '61 I'm an army of Virginia man I've been from Mannasas to Mackonackey All the way to Sailors Creek fighting For my home land After 4 years gone and all hope lost And Richmond under seige And we're diggin out Five Forks And waitin in the rain For Sheridan to bring us to our knees So take me home...Lone pine hill There's a strange moon hangin' overhead tonight And if the rain keeps comin then the creek's gonna rise With the good lord's grace I'll make it outta this place and I'll be in your arms come the morning light I swear...So god grant me speed and grant me forgiveness And carry me on through the night Take me through your hills and over your rivers Away from this awful fight Cause I ain't never known a man that's ever owned another Ain't never owned nothin' of my own And after 4 long years I just can't tell you What the hell I've been fighting for...So take me home...Lone pine hillIf you don't like sunny days Then I'll make it rain Make a bird sing Any song you wanna hear it singing Fix all your broken things If I was the devil I'll take you down And put you in my house Keep you nice and close Teach you what you don't know I'll take you from the holy ghost If I was the devil You might not believe in me But I'll make you believe And you'll know my name You might not believe me But I'll make you believe And you'll know my nameI am my father's son I've never known when to shut up I ain't fooling no one I am my father's son We don't see eye to eye And I'll be the first to admit I've never tried It's sure it hurts, but it should hurt sometimes We don't see eye to eye I was a young man when I first found the pleasure in the feel of a sin I went down the same road as my old man But I was younger then Now its 3 AM and I'm standing in the kitchen Holding my last cigarette Strike a match and I see my reflection in the mirror in the hall And I say to myselfTired of laying in bed, listening to the water run Ceiling's falling in, baby's dress is covered in dust So I don't care what it costs, baby, dust that old thing off It's one more night in Brooklyn, baby, we're getting lost I ain't taking you home, I found a little place that'll do It'll never match the beauty of a Tennessee spring, but it's something new So let 'em say what they'll say, I'll find a way that we'll make it pay It's one more night in Brooklyn, baby, that's all I can take I'm tired of waiting on you Waiting on a train I'm tired of your late night calls With the same old complaints So you pack up your bags, start looking west, but tonight Ordering in, making damn sure we don't leave nothing behind Baby, put your hands on me, let's get real high and just go to sleep It's one more night in Brooklyn, baby, it's just you and me One more nightWell he woke up that morning and he called into work Put on his daddy's old suit with a second hand shirt All untucked, shoes untied, the people all snickered as he walked by So he stopped in a bar, bought a shot of Stevens, and another He bummed a cigarette, and sat talking with a stranger about the weather And then he paid his bill and he stepped outside, fell down into the street He cursed, and he cried as he climbed back up to his feet again So up the road he found a payphone and called his mom He said, ""Mama I think I'll be coming home I been feeling so bad, and tired of this city Ain't been the same since I lost my pretty Angeline, Mama I miss her so It's been over a year and there ain't nothing I fear so much as being alone.""And then he hung up the phone without saying good-bye Stopped in a store and bought a postcard and signed it""Fare thee well"", and sent it back home to Yuma Lookin' back I'd say, it wasn't so much the girl As it was the booze and the dope And the way he took the weight of the world up upon his shoulders And let it wash the blue from his eyes as he grew colder As through all those lonely nights there left alone So he was just 23 when he stepped out on that ledge It was his weary heart that pushed him to the edge He was tired of living life, looking for love""A weary heart just needs a little touch And is it too much to ask "", he cried as he stepped into the wind He turned his back on the world and he fell back to Earth againI'm a bad dream I'm not a nightmare, I'm too pretty for that Let's just say I'm the last thing you wanna see coming I'm the reason they say watch your back For so long, I was like a wounded hound Backed into a chainlink fence The world at large was just a big, mean kid Poking me through the fence with a stick Ain't nobody goin' back It takes a whole lotta hurt Therein lies one of life's biggest lessons Ain't got nothin' to do with deserve Just pray to the Saint of Lost Causes Now it's a cruel world But it ain't hard to understand You got your sheep, got your shepherds Got your wolves amongst men It can be hard to tell You might find a wolf in shepherd's clothes And now and then you're gonna find sheep Hidden amongst all those troubled souls You know the folks that's most afraid of the wolf If you really stop and think Throughout time, between a wolf and a shepherd Who do you think has killed more sheep Nah, there's nothing can be done It's just the way it goes First you get bad, then you get mean Then there's nothing left but to grow cold And pray to the Saint of Lost CausesHair up high and seat reared back Looked like she should be driving something long and black All I’m asking you Brother do you know her Pretty little thing riding by in a champagne Corolla I've seen you around just here just last night Today she been by two or three times Ain’t you listening to me Lord I done told you Pretty little thing riding by in a champagne Corolla I asked the boys on the corner Did they know how many them things you think is out on the road The one I mean I say if you seen her you know her Pretty little thing riding by in a champagne Corolla I don’t care what no man say She can run all week on just one tank Goes to show you Maybe baby got a head on her shoulders And she sure looks sweet driving by in that champagne CorollaWell, she comes out at night with the cold winds of December And when it's quiet you hear her engines cry She blows smoke at her wheels and her gears pound the steel As they carry her on down the line Now I'm sure that you've heard stories, as most of us have In the lunch counter and barber shop queues She's the Ghost of Virginia and from here up to Richmond She runs by the light of the moon Well a few years back on the old Suffolk Road Where it crosses the abandoned rail line My Grandpa claimed that he'd seen a freight train And it wasn't no sleek streamline She was cold black and steel and she screamed as she cut Her way clear of the pines But he swears to this day he can feel the earth shake And smell her smoke when the wind's just right Ah, but back in her day she was a real working horse Haulin' coal out for old man Ward She was tied up in ribbons and set out of Richmond Haulin' soldiers during the war Ah, but some say she wrecked and she rides these rails Hopin' one day that she'll get it right Others say she roams out picking up lost souls And carryin' 'em down to CarolinaMy best friend lived in this house And we played ball in the street after school God knows how he's living now I heard his mom lost the house and had to move And sure, it's looking better these days Well it's hard to believe And this ain't the way it was back in 1993 And those weren't better days But they still meant something to me When we was kids out in the streets Now there was a market on the corner, it was next to the car wash And a lazy weeping willow across the street in the light Where the old men played dominoes on those hot summer days Sweatin' their Wild Irish Rose out in the shade And from Wedgewood to Granny White Oh, and Belmont to 8th All these songs was broke into a host of sights and shapes And that was low-rent livin'Back when life was cheap When we was kids out in the streets"

Anderson East,adult alternative artists,10,"She can wear a nightgown to a wedding A t-shirt to bed Or short skirts in the olden times Some daisies wrapped 'round her head You can find my woman dancing in bare feet On the couch in a ballroom dress And I love how my baby looks at me With arms draped 'round my neck I said, ""Oh, honey, just like that""I give you my loving and you give it right back I said, ""Oh, honey, just like this""Hanging on, white knuckle grip Feel something when I kiss you goodnight Feel something when I open my eyes Feel that I could be your sweetest compromise It's all on my mind It's all on my mindWhat would it take To make you want me What would it take To make you love me Would it take flowers Red roses from vines Would it take diamonds To let you know you were mine Well, I'll take you dancing Sweep you off your feet What do you need To know you're the only one, one for me And what would it take To make you love me What would it take To make you love me What words can I say Tell me, what can I do And all that I am And I'll give it to you I can make you smile Give you all your dreams And I'd give everything To make you love me Oh, andThere's a girl in Shelbyville Gave her life to Jesus First Antioch Baptist Church, where her dad preaches She's pretty as her mama; she's only 23 And she could be an angel, Lord Cause she's bringing out the devil in me Lord, forgive me for what I'm thinking Cause it's Saturday night and I'm high and I've been drinking But come tomorrow morning across the aisle I look over and see her smile Bow my head and the choir sings Lord, forgive me; she's bringing out the devil in me Sundress on a willow tree Smooth on the water I know the Lord's been good to me when I look at the preacher's daughter But she's my Delilah; she brings me to my knees And she could be an angel Cause she's bringing out the devil in me Lord, forgive me for what I'm thinking Saturday night and I'm high and I've been drinking But come tomorrow morning across the aisle I look over and see her smile Bow my head and the choir sings Lord, forgive me; she's bringing out the devil in meLooking all around, you think nothing is really working The pieces never fit quite naturally It didn't come with directions, but somehow we found perfection And it all worked out just how it was meant to be Through the passion, through the fights The wrong turns we made right The one thing, one thing never changed And this too shall last When the beauty is gone and time goes by too fast The feelings, the lonely troubles don't seem to pass We got each other, it will be alright We got the love to make it through the night This too shall last Now the door is always open, never mentioned and never spoken And only we know where we like to hide the keys And no wind could have weathered, it's holding us together As long as we live in our home, yeah I believe And this too shall last When the beauty is gone and time goes by too fast The feelings, the lonely troubles don't seem to pass We got each other, it will be alright We got the love to make it through the night This too shall last This too shall lastI've sipped the finest brandy Smelled the

they always hold the promise of ruins The fountain of youth, we run into, is just an illusion A glass is always half full, till you fill it to the top I remember when you're with me, I forget it when

Echo & the Bunnymen,adult alternative artists,10,"Under blue moon I saw you So soon you'll take me Up in your arms too late to beg you Or cancel it, though I know it must be The killing time Unwillingly mine Fate Up against your will Through the thick and thin He will wait until You give yourself to him In starlit nights I saw you So cruelly you kissed me Your lips a magic world Your sky all hung with jewels The killing moon Will come too soon Fate Up against your will Through the thick and thin He will wait until You give yourself to himCutter Cutter Cutter Who's on the seventh floor Brewing alternatives What's in the bottom drawer Waiting for things to give Spare us the cutter Spare us the cutter Couldn't cut the Mustard Conquering myself until I see another hurdle approaching Say we can, say we will Not just another drop in the ocean Come to the free for all With Sellotape and knives Some of us six feet tall We will escape our liesJimmy Brown, made of stone Charlie Clown, no way home Bring on the dancing horses Headless and all alone Shiver and say the words Of every lie you've heard First I'm gonna make it Then I'm gonna break it Till it falls apart Hating all the faking And shaking while I'm breaking Your brittle heart Billy stands all alone Sinking sand, skin and bone Bring on the dancing horses Wherever they may roam Shiver and say the words Of every lie you've heard First I'm gonna make it Then I'm gonna break it Till it falls apart Hating all the faking And shaking while I'm breaking Your brittle heartShe floats like a swan Grace on the water Lips like sugar, lips like sugar Just when you think you've caught her She glides across the water She calls for you tonight To share this moonlight You'll flow down her river She'll ask and you'll give her Lips like sugar Sugar kisses Lips like sugar Sugar kisses She knows what she knows I know what she's thinking Sugar kisses, sugar kisses Just when you think she's yours She's flown to other shores To laugh at how you break And melt into this lakeI want it now I want it now Not the promises of what tomorrow brings I need to live in dreams today I'm tired of the song that sorrow sings And I want more than I can get Just trying to, trying to, trying to forget I'd walk to you through rings of fire And never let you know the way I feel Under skin is where I hide The love that always gets me on my knees And I want more than I can get Just trying to, trying to, trying to forget Nothing ever lasts forever Nothing ever lasts forever Nothing ever lasts forever Nothing ever lasts forever I want it now I want it now Don't tell me that my ship is coming in Nothing comes to those who wait Time's running out the door, you're running inIn an ice-capped fire Of burning wood In our world of wire Ignite our dreams Of starry skies And you and me As realized Our bigger themes Oh, take me internally Forever yours Nocturnal me Take me internally Forever yours Nocturnal me Do or die What's done is done True beauty lies On the blue horizon Who or why What's one is one In pure disguise Of vulgar sonsAll at sea again And now my hurricanes have brought down this ocean rain To bathe me again My ship's a-sail Can you hear its tender frame Screaming from beneath the waves Screaming from beneath the waves All hands on deck at dawn Sailing to sadder shores Your port in my heavy storms Harbours the blackest thoughts I'm at sea again And now your hurricanes have brought down this ocean rain To bathe me again My ship's a-sail Can you hear its tender frame Screaming from beneath the waves Screaming from beneath the waves...All hands on deck at dawn Sailing to sadder shores Your port in my heavy storms Harbours the blackest thoughtsI chop and I change and the mystery thickens There's blood on my hands and you want me to listen To brawn and to brain when the truth's in the middle Born of the grain like all good riddles B-b-burn the skin off and climb the roof top Thy will be done B-b-bite the nose off and make it the most of Your king- kingdom kingdom kingdom You kill when you talk and the enemy weakens Your words start to walk when you're not even speaking If my heart is a
