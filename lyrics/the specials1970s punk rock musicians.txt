what I do at weekends I can't talk and I can't walk But I know where I'm going to go I'm going to watch my money go At the Locarno, no When my feet go through the door I know what my right arm is for Buy a drink and pull a chair Up to the edge of the dance floor Bouncers bouncing through the night Trying to stop or start a fight I sit and watch the flashing lights Moving legs in footless tights I go out on Friday night and I come home on Saturday morning I go out on Friday night and I come home on Saturday morningEach day I walk along this lonely street Trying to find, find a future New pair of shoes are on my feet Cause fashion is my only culture Nothing ever change, oh, no Nothing ever change People say to me just be yourself It makes no sense to follow fashion How could I be anybody else I don't try, I've got no reason Nothing ever change, oh, no Nothing ever change I'm just living in a life without meaning I walk and walk, do nothing I'm just living in a life without feeling I talk and talk, say nothing
