Somebody make a move Somebody make a move Please somebody Test my reality Check if there's a weak spot Clingin' to insanity In hopes the world will ease up Try to make it look like it's all somehow getting better'Cause I know how to play it pretty good against the measure Everyone started out a little insane But we learn pretty quick how to fake it for the game But some of you never learned to drop the act So under that skin of yours: a heart attack'Cause everybody's so scared We don't wanna go there We don't wanna make a move We got all our lives to lose Screaming in the dark while we just play our part out I play along Like I don't know what's going onWe throw tantrums like parties We're not happy 'till everyone knows we're sick And that's just how we like it We've hurt bad enough, right, we've earned it Don't tell the others, but it's all getting old I mean, how any more times must our stories be told And being lonely's only fun in a group It sort of loses it's charm when it's true I meant it when I said I wanna get well, I wanna get well Are the rest of you so content Stay where you are but it hurts like help And I'm sure it was fun at first Test your pulse and check your vitals If it's only a game, you lost me I quit it with the suicidal recital So now you know all my secrets I want out, I know I don't need this!I want friends who don't rank me on what I've been through The more a battle scars, the more attention it gets youI don't wanna break down, but I'm feeling low Let me sink to the bottom Air in my lungs keeping me afloat Inside I'm still hollow I know I'm not my thoughts But my thoughts don't know that yet Sometimes I try to sneak up On the voice inside my head I try to meditate, cause they told me it'll help But the last thing I need is more time alone inside myself I know I'm not unique, we all got broken brains Culture recently decided being crazy is okay And now we all can talk about it on our social feeds Having a rough day Hashtag mental health awareness week I know that's progress We don't have to hide no more But it leaves me wondering why we ain't said this stuff before Like were we always all crazy and we all just kept quiet Are we on the same page with what we're identifying And if crazy's the new normal then it's not that crazy, is it Cause the word by definition means it sits outside the system And how can we tell difference between sick and tryna' fit in And if everybody's crazy, then who's supposed to fix it I can't help but close my eyes for life And dream a different ending When I wake, I won't be so exhausted And I'll stop with my pretending That I'm fine, I'm fine if I can fool myself tonight And my lie will drown out all of yours I will not bend until I break How much can one bruised body take Just not enough to silence me You're only a memory I'll scream these words till they come true Then I will think no more of you Look back on what I'm going through This isn't my identity You will bleed for what your hands have done You can't outrun your ending And I'll get well long before you let yourself I may forgive you but you never will I will not bend until I break How much can one bruised body take Just not enough to silence me You're only a memory I'll scream these words till they come true Then I will think no more of you Look back on what I'm going through This isn't my identityOh, I swear my emotions are the enemy Be dead by now if I'd have done what they were telling me Whisper lies, but they sound like half-truth Confusing a sick mind isn't that hard to do You say I'm a hopeless case, I'm a hopeless case You say I'm a hopeless case, I'm a hopeless case I'm afraid I can't trust myself, myself Don't leave me alone How you want me to fix myself, myself All I've ever known, I've ever known How can I separate me from the remedy I can't be sure, be sure Am I the curse or the cure Oh, it's more than a little maddening Got me second-guessing everything that's happening I think, I think I'm in over my head The more I think about it, the worse that it gets You say I'm a hopeless case, I'm a hopeless case You say I'm a hopeless case, I'm a hopeless caseI say I wanna be healthy, but I turn up the noise The I V drips a steady stream of poison I think I'm just in love with the feeling Break my bones so I can feel them healing"Crazy" is, I believe, the medical term When we wanna recover, but we don't wanna learn Keep breaking what's been fixed a thousand times And gimme some more of that iodine I can't make reality connect I push till I have nothing left But if we want to wake up Why we still singin' these lullabies I'll run in circles till I crash One day these steps will be my last But if we want to wake up Why we still singin' these lullabies I say I wanna be happy, but I quickly forget Will I sabotage all the good I've got left Depression's like a big fur coat It's made of dead things but it keeps me warmMisery, misery is the venom in my brain Killin' me, killin' me, but I don't feel the pain Running from something that I can't really explain Misery, misery is the venom in our veins It's been kind of cold, feeling all alone Haven't been myself in quite a while, you know They got in my head, like everybody said Cautionary tale, how quick the sick can spread Don't meet their eyes, it's hypnotic Make you forget that it's toxic Caught up in all the chaotic Sold you a lie and you bought it Before you know it, you're nauseous Hands down your throat 'til you vomit Collapse from all the exhaustion And now they got what they wanted Misery, misery is the venom in my brain Killin' me, killin' me, but I don't feel the pain Running from something that I can't really explain Misery, misery is the venom in our veinsSeem like everywhere I go, everybody wanna know"What's it like to be a girl, in the music world "The scene is so sexist, believe me I get it, we'd probably sell more records if I flaunted my ass and chest but forget it I work like one of the boys, and I'm as true as they get But I'm a lady through and through, like give me some credit I knew I'd regret it if I tried to blend in and pretend Be something other than I am Like have you noticed I'm a woman Didn't come to downplay it, or to play it up either And I'm not trying pick a fight or be nobody's leader But it feels like everybody's just a little too interested In the fact that females can indeed make music Our interviews, our bios, - they all make it a point"Female Fronted Band, from Decatur, Illinois"And just once, I'd like to see some other band's resumé go out of their way to say they're fronted by a male, ok And while we're on it, let me say Women don't all sound the same Who gave us the idea that "Female Fronted” is a genre anyway Seem like everywhere I go, everybody wanna know"What's it like to be a girl, in the music world "Wanna make it disappear, tell 'em what they wanna hear If truth ain't pretty will you all stay with me Will you love me, love me ugly Do your thing but you oughta know We just make it up as we go No point in stressing, we're not impressing them anymore They're so scripted, they're so predictable, like oh-oh Do your thing but you oughta know We just make it up as we go No point in stressing, were not impressing them anymore We've unscripted, now we do what we want, like oh-oh Stuck us in boxes, that's where you want us Cardboard is boring, we brought our matches S-s-stuck us in boxes, that's where you want us Cardboard is boring, look how it burns Tell me, do you have a pulse Do you have a pulse Do you have a p-p-p-pulse Tell me, do you even know Do you even know Do you even k-k-k-know Tell me, do you have a pulse Do you have a pulse Do you have a p-p-p-pulse Tell me, do you even know Do you even know Do you even k-k-k-know You and I go deep like water You and I run red like blood You know my darkest secrets I know what you're made of Drip drop, the rain is falling I hear it all could flood One rainy night away From losing all you love It's a brilliant game you play When you lock yourself away and You make me fight for you, you, you I can't keep you above water I can't drag your soul to shore Don't know how to fix a sinking ship Or win a losing war It's a heavy load to carry And I can't hold on much more On the surface, it looks perfect Underneath, it's just a perfect storm I've so much more to tell you We're running out of time It's dark and dangerous Treading oceans in your mind Up all night I held your hand While you wondered in the dark You know I can't make you better When all you want to be is lost
