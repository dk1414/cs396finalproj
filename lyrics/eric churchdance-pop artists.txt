Hey there, weird kid in your high-top shoes Sitting in the back of the class; I was just like you Always left out, never fit in Owning that path you're walking in Mr  Misunderstood, Mr  Misunderstood Now, your buddies get their rocks off on Top 40 radio But you love your daddy's vinyl, old-time rock and roll Elvis Costello, Ray Wylie Hubbard And think Jeff Tweedy is one bad mother Mr  Misunderstood, Mr  Misunderstood One day you'll lead the charge, you'll lead the band Guitar Hero with lightnin' hands And the girls will like your tattoos and the veins in your arms They'll be helpless to your musical charms And they'll all hold up their hands They'll all wanna dance Mr  Misunderstood, Mr  Misunderstood First time I met Alabama Hannah, I was skinny as a rail Red hair tied up in a blue bandanna She was hotter than the Devil's hell She turned me on to Back Porch Pickers Jackson Pollock, and gin Her daddy didn't trust my intentions So he turned to his daddy's old .410 I'm Mr  Misunderstood, Mr  MisunderstoodSince you turned the tables on me I've been steady and learnin' lonely Keepin' this turntable spinnin'Everything from Jones to Jennings Slowly plannin' my survival In a three-foot stack of vinyl Since you had to walk on outta here I've been havin' a record year I bet you thought before you left I'd just sit in silence by myself Turn this house into a jail Dyin' slow in a livin' hell But love's got a funny way of keepin' score And your leavin' lit up my scoreboard I usually make it through side A sober All bets are off when I flip her over One bourbon, one scotch, one beer I'm havin' a record year Quarter notes and Hank's half time Are poundin' on this heart of mine Song to song, I pass my time With these speakers on ten Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night Along with Songs In The Key of Life I'm either gonna get over you Or I'm gonna blow out my ears Yeah, you're out there now Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here Havin' a record yearTake me on up to Detroit City Jails are full, the factories empty Mama's crying, young boys dying Under that red, white, and blue still flying Drop me off in Baltimore Where every other window's got a plywood board Where dreams become drugs and guns The only way out is to shoot or run Stick that in your country song, yeah Take that one to number one, yeah And get the whole world singing along, yeah Stick that in your country song, yeah Sing about the man coming back from war A 23 going on 54 He lost a friend, his sight, his hands Baby girl he'll never see again Stick that in your country song, yeah Take that one to number one, yeah And get the whole world singing along, man Stick that in your country song, yeah Beer don't keep, love's not cheap And trucks don't wreck themselves Mama ain't a shrink, daddy ain't a bank And God ain't a wishin' well Money ain't rich, everybody sins And nobody wins in a fight And sometimes wrong is right Some of it you learn the hard way Some of it you read on a page Some of it comes from heartbreak Most of it comes with age And none of it ever comes easy A bunch of it you maybe can't use I know I don't probably know what I think I do But there's somethin' to some of it Girls like to laugh, tears don't last And scared's what praying's for If it's close, swing the bat, everybody's got a past And love's worth livin' for When you dance, hold her close, 'til it breaks, go for broke Be the first to reach for her hand No, you don't get to do some things againI, I been gone Been gone too long, singing my songs on the road Another town, one more show and I'm coming home Don't give a damn what these keys are for I'm gonna knock down that front door, and I'ma find out what that house is made of Been too many nights since it's felt us make love I wanna rock some sheetrock, knock some pictures off the wall Love you baby, like a wrecking ball You, look at you Send me one more shot sitting on a bathroom sink Damn you really turn me on painting your toenails pink Easy baby before you say"But if I can make it just one more day," and That old house is gonna be shaking I hope those bricks and boards can take it But I won't be surprised if the whole damn place just falls I'm gonna rock you baby, like a wrecking ballAnother Friday night there's a line of cars leavin'Home team's got an out-of-towner Me, I'm sittin' on the hood of mine drinkin'I'm just a parkin' lot down-and-outer Under that high school bleacher I drove that preacher's daughter crazy Her mama was my homeroom teacher And her dad was hell bent on savin' me Yeah, I'm sure there's higher highs Where the high risers rise But me, I'm gonna sit right here tonight, and Catch me a 'round here buzz'Cause you ain't 'round here none Keep puttin' 'em down here, 'nother round here'Til my down goes up Lit up like that one stoplight Across from that welcome sign Ever since you caught that out there bug I catch me a 'round here buzzTurn on a neon light At least make it feel like night Put on some this or that Maybe I won't feel so bad I need a little background noise To drown out this little voice Runnin' circles 'round my brain Screamin' louder than the pain My head is spinning My resolve is reeling I can tell by the heavy in my heart I'm goin' down soon No use fightin' the fight It's no contest tonight My figured out has never been more confused Havin' mixed drinks about feelings and you Turn off the bedroom light Put on a brave face and face the night It's either get used to this dread Or the cold spot in our bed The bottle helps, but the memory burns The whiskey soothes, but I toss and turn I'll find sleep 'til dreams relent Wake up tired and try againTo this day when I hear that song I see you standin' there on that lawn Discount shades, store bought tan Flip flops and cut-off jeans Somewhere between that setting sun I'm on Fire and Born to Run You looked at me and I was done And we're, we're just getting started I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me I was so alive, never been more free Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang Oohh Stayed there 'til they forced us out And took the long way to your house I can still hear the sound of you sayin' "don't go"When I think about you, I think about 17 I think about my old Jeep I think about the stars in the sky Funny how a melody sounds like a memory Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night SpringsteenUse every crayon color that you've got A fishing pole sinks faster than a tackle box Nothing turns a day around like licking a mixing bowl I learned that from a three year old A garbage can is a damn good spot to hide truck keys Why go inside when you can go behind a tree Walking barefoot through the mud Will knock the rust right off your soul I learned that from a three year old You can be a cowboy on the moon Dig to China with a spoon Talk to Jesus on the phone Say "I love you" all day long And when you're wrong, you should just say so I learned that from a three year old"Mama is an angel," I heard him tell the man upstairs He went on and on and back and forth Like God was laying there Tonight, I sleep me down to lay and pray to keep my soul Yeah, I learned that from a three year oldI don't why it does but it sure do, don't it, honey Bein' in love with you is as easy as spendin' money Keep me higher than the fog, it's a-hidin' my copper line-ups Yeah, there ain't no landing gear on this big jetliner Benedictine baby Chartreuse snake old lady Appalachia moonshine crazy Bible belt and a sinner's fire Love on a higher wire Brother, it's a mother undercover with a voodoo woman Roll the dice, bet your life every night, keep the black magic comin'I should run from you like a vampire does from daylight But I don't know how to quit 'cause I know what addiction tastes like Benedictine baby Chartreuse snake old lady Appalachia moonshine crazy Bible belt and a sinner's fire Love on a higher wire
