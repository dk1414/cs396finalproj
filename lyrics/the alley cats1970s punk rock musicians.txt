puddin' n' tain Ask me again I'll tell you the sameSanta Monica Boulevard Give me reason to exist Give me slaughter on the avenue Give me one last holy kiss In this night Night of the living dead They come from the grave To devour human flesh They walk these streets of death Arise in the shattered hour Approach in the stealthy fog Your fingertips like fire In this frozen time of horror Johnny took two quaaludes And he laid down in the street With his eyes almost half open He could see them in his sleep In this night Night of the living dead They wanted to take him home To dress him in leather black And black is the color of death And death is the color of night And night is where they reside These men with young boy’s eyes These young boys of the nightIn the methedrine city Everybody's losing their heads Waltzing with the devil Dancing with the dead The rich kids are zombies They wander around Laboratory morons In the lost and found It's a fluorescent nightmare Where night is day Throwing beer cans in the storm drain Watching them float away The sister of darkness Is doing quite well She kisses the winos And sends them to hell The boys in the alley They heat up the spoon They sway with their sorrows They howl at the moon It's a nightmare city In a nightmare world You think that it's over But it's hardly begunNo-no, never fall in love again, no-no Never fall in love again,

I'm so afraid That we will have to part Each night I ask the stars up above Why must I be a teenager in love One day I feel so happy Next day I feel so sad I guess I'll learn To take the good with the bad'Cause each night I ask the stars up above Why must I be a teenager in love I cried a tear for nobody but you I'll be a lonely one If you should say we're through Well if you want to make me cry That won't be so hard to do If you should say goodbye I'd still go on loving you Each night I ask the stars up above Why must I bе a teenager in loveYou taught me how to cry When I couldn't talk We spent light-years together In the dark With sailors, barflies And drunken cops In smokey rooms, broken dreams And broken hearts But you never told me a reason The reason that life is so cold You held me that night when I was freezing That night you kept saying, you kept saying You kept saying, "babe"In this world of jagged edges And dusty ruins Forever seemed like never And never came too soon When you spoke softly With your husky breath You were the angel of mercy In this valley of death But you never told me a reason The reason that life is so cold You held me that night when I was freezing That night you kept saying, you kept saying You kept saying, "babe"Like spirits, we flew To the seashore We lay our blankets In the sand We started a fire Only we could feel You touched my heard I touched your hand Now the roar of the ocean Sounds like the beginning of time Life is just one small moment We are born and then we die It only hurts the first time It only hurts the first time It only hurts the first time It only hurts the first time Push me up Lay me down Listen to the sky Fall to the ground Follow me Through darkened corridors Follow me Where the river flows
