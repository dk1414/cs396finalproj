Just like the white winged dove Sings a song Sounds like she's singin'Whoo-whoo-whoo Just like the white winged dove Sings a song Sounds like she's singin'Whoo, baby, whoo Said, whoo And the days go by Like a strand in the wind In the web that is my own I begin again Said to my friend, baby Nothin' else mattered He was no more Than a baby then Well, he seemed broken hearted Somethin' within him But the moment That I first laid Eyes on him All alone on the edge of seventeenNo one looked as I walked by Just an invitation would have been just fine Said no to him again and again First, he took my heart, then he ran No one knows how I feel What I say, unless you read between my lines One man walked away from me First he took my hand Take me home Stand back, stand back In the middle of my room, I did not hear from you It's alright, it's alright To be standing in a line To be standing in a line I would cry La la la la la la la la la La la La la la la la Do not turn away my friend Like a willow, I can bend No man calls my name No man came So, I walked on down, away from you Maybe your attention was more than you could do One man did not call He asked me for my love, and that was allBaby, you'll come knocking on my front door Same old line you used to use before I said yeah, well what am I supposed to do I didn't know what I was getting into So you've had a little trouble in town Now you're keeping some demons down Stop draggin' my, stop draggin' my Stop draggin' my heart around It's hard to think about what you've wanted It's hard to think about what you've lost This doesn't have to be the big get even This doesn't have to be anything at all I know you really wanna tell me goodbye I know you really wanna be your own girl Baby, you could never look me in the eye Yeah, you buckle with the weight of the world Stop draggin' my, stop draggin' my Stop draggin' my heart aroundIs love so fragile and the heart so hollow Shatter with words, impossible to follow You're saying I'm fragile, try not to be I search only for something I can't see I have my own life And I am stronger than you know But I carry this feeling When you walked into my house That you won't be walking out the door Still, I carry this feeling When you walked into my house That you won't be walking out the door Lovers forever, face to face My city, your mountains Stay with me, stay I need you to love me I need you today Give to me your leather Take from me my lace You in the moonlight With your sleepy eyes Could you ever love a man like me And you were right When I walked into your house I knew I'd never wanna leaveI can see we're thinkin' 'bout the same things Yes, I see your expression when the phone rings We both know there's something happening here There's no sense in dancing 'round the subject A wound gets worse when it's treated with neglect Well, don't turn now there's nothing here to fear You can talk to me Talk to me You can talk to me You can set your secrets free, baby Dusty words lying under carpets Seldom heard, well, must you keep your secrets Locked inside Hidden deep from view Is it all that hard Is it all that tough Well, I've shown you all my cards Well, isn't that enough You can hide your hurt But there's something you can doHas anyone ever written anything for you In all your darkest hours Have you ever heard me sing Listen to me now You know I'd rather be alone Than be without you Don't you know Has anyone ever given anything to you In your darkest hours Did you ever give it back Well I have I have given that to you If it's all I ever do This is your song And the rain comes down There's no pain and there's no doubt It was easy to say I believed in you everyday If not for me then Do it for the worldRhiannon rings like a bell through the night And wouldn't you love to love her She rules her life  like a bird in flight And who will be her lover All your life you've never seen A woman taken by the sky Would you stay if she promised to you heaven Oh would you even try He says, "Rhiannon""Don't go"And he says "Rhiannon""Stay"And he says "I still cry out for you"Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night and Won't you love to love her She rules her life like a bird in flight and Who will be her lover All your life you've never seen a woman Taken by the sky Where would you stay if she promised to you heaven Would you even try Do you always trust your first, initial feeling Special knowledge holds true, bears believing I turned around and the water was closing all around Like a glove, like the love, that had finally, finally found me And I knew in the crystalline knowledge of you Drove me through the mountain Through the crystal-like and clear water fountain Drove me like a magnet to the sea, to the sea To the sea, yeah How the faces of love changed, turning the pages And I have changed, oh, but you, you remain ageless I turned around and the water was closing all around Like a glove, like the love that had finally, finally found me And I knew in the crystalline knowledge of you Drove me through the mountain Through the crystal-like and clear water fountain Drove me like a magnet to the sea, to the sea To the sea, yeah, to the sea, yeah Yeah, yeahAnd the summer became the fall I was not ready for the winter It makes no difference at all'Cause I wear boots all summer long My eye makeup, dark, and it's careless Same circles around my eyes Sometimes the real color of my skin My eyes, without any shadow And when I call, will you walk gently through my shadow The ones who sing at night The ones who sing at night The ones you dream of, the ones who walk away With their capes pulled around them tight Crying for the night Cry for the nightbird tonight The winter's really here now And the blankets that I love Sometimes I am surrounded by too much love And when I call, will you walk gently through my shadow It's the ones who sing at night It's the ones who sing at night The ones you dream of, the ones who walk away With their capes pulled around them tight Crying for the night Cry for the nightbird tonightJust like the white winged dove Sings a song Sounds like she's singin'Whoo-whoo-whoo
