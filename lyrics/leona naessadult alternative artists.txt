I'm not ready and I'm not even close I'm not like the rest No I ain't like most So don't hold your breath And don't count to ten I'm still messing up Want to do it again So lets go out late Drink a lot Stay up past 8 and then dance Dance all night And leave our boyfriends behind One hand on the trigger And one eye out for ghosts One foot on the floor And one glass in the toast We're not ready and we're Not even close We're not like the rest No we ain't like most So lets go out late Drink a lot Stay up past 8 and then dance Dance all night And leave our boyfriends behind Leave your girlfriend behind I've got a boyfriend I've got a boyfriend I've got a boyfriend Lets go out late Drink a lot Stay up past 8 and then dance Dance all night And leave our boyfriends behind Oh lets call our friends And pretend we've got ages till The sun comes along Till the end of this song Oh lets go out late Drink a lot Stay up past 8 and then dance Dance all night And leave your girlfriend behind I'll leave my boyfriend behind We'll go out late Drink a lot Stay up past 8 and then dance Dance all night Leave our boyfriends behind Leave my girlfriend behindI'll never feel the weight of your hands Inside mine like diamonds Lace so fine ballerina Cupcake and my earthquake Wakes me from my sleep that Never comes, are you breathing Waiting for me I didn't really want you But I want you now Was so foolish of me Feel you tumbling down Into that empty room The lights went out I want to rescue want to scream out loud I didn't think I needed you But I need you now Was so empty in me Feel you crashing down Into the empty world The music stops I want to rescue want to scream out loud You will always be mine The room spins Pull you from me My body burns Tell me all the rainbows The colors that the rain throws Ballerina dance softly She knows when to come only When she's called on slowly coming toHe's the kind of guy Who's always passing by Who never has time to spend And he'll take you for a spin And won't look within To find out who you are And he numbs himself with weed He's from the coldest breed Who judge by what they see And I thought he was Smart enough to know That the girl on his arm Will never calm his storms Watch out, he'll charm you Chorus:Smoother than the L.A  weather That's how he holds himself together He is colder than the winter I wrap my coat around To bear the cataract Of his charm attack That leaves me hungry Well, I'm no savior But I tried to save you With all my love That rage and hide insideGonna get it right Gonna put lipstick on tonight Gonna wear a dress The one that shows my legs You’ll be running around Running around like a fool Do I pull my hair out Shake it out Put it in a bow Or leave it down I know, I know I’m acting like a little girl But it’s not easy for me But it’s lovely to be A little less heavy And a little old cherry On the icing for me Walk into the room Talk to everyone but you Slide in close Like a wanted ghost But when it’s time to go I promise I will let you knowBlue light Flashing in my heart tonight Telling me that I'm alright And will be for some time Leave me now Playing on the radio Leave me for the friends we know I will only break your heart Sundays I remember you With your sleepy eye shading pale blue My baby's gone and everybody knows The fever hit me in my fingers and through My toes This baby's gone and boy you know it shows This baby's gone Will I see you again When I knew you my heart was in bends And I know I never said goodbye But boys like you don't ever cry Don't speak The smile is sliding down my cheek I only came here to get what I need White light blinding my way tonight Will you remember me like I was Dive, dive down In the deep dark waters Swim your body to me We'll look for shelter In the caves of Gibraltar Maybe some pearls for me Swing, swing gently Sweet, sweet music Waves outline the sea And I never told you that I was sorry Maybe you're sorry too I can't tell you that I won't hurt you But I'll promise to try Everybody wants a piece of pie, honey I just want him alive So dumb, dumb down Let me steal your crown Let me wear your favorite coat You know the one you bought in old New York Its buttons have all been worn down And we'll walk to sixth and I'll take the fifth But I know you'll never lie And you'll wear the tie that only I Could ever have bought for you And we'll catch a cold at the last drum roll And skip the morning newsRoll the carpet and pour out the wine Treat me like it's your first valentine'Cause, honey baby, you've been on my mind Like all of us who have waited for a time I'm calling, can you hear me The angels will steer me To your door, feel so sure The night is the brightest Who knows what I really will do What I really will say What I really will feel Who knows what you really will do What you really will say What you really will feel Call the papers and call your friends No longer do we have to pretend'Cause, honey baby, you've been on my mind Like all of us who have waited for a time, oh I'm calling, can you hear me The angels will steer me To your door, feel so sure The night is the brightest Who knows what I really will do What I really will say What I really will feel Who knows what you really will do What you really will say What you really will feelTake my lips and place them upon you Catch my eyes and let them design you Grab these arms and wrap them around your love Shake these hips and let them persuade you Take my songs They're always about you Been so crazy Still here without no love I can hear your songs through my radio Singing soft, singing slow Songs I love, the songs I know Takes me back to when life was slow Take my words and let them pray for you Take my chords, and let them play for you In my car, the world is beckoning now Been so slow in this town without you Been so still, and there's room to doubt you Winter's coming, but I still have your song I can hear you now through my radio Singing strong, singing slow The songs I love, the songs I know Sing them loud, love is slowHoney you've been on my mind Like Christmas and birthdays when I was five Like the ticking clock for racers and those in the prison the line Like Everest for Mallory and how drinkers know their wine And the birds and the bees when you hit nine And pearls for those girls who always have their hair in pretty curls You're on my mind x4 Honey you've been in my head Like homework on Sunday when I've been laughing instead Like cigarettes for the cool kids behind the garden shed And love for the lovers and the elephant by my bed And pearls for those girls who always have their hair in pretty curls And football for English boys who always have the newest toys You're on my mind x4 So don't you go away too long x4 You're on my mind x4You're easily amused, by what you use By what you use on the outside But it's what shines Like silver and gold Silver and gold on the inside It's a recipe, what it is to be What it is to be on the inside The skin outside Is taking you for a ride Taking you for a ride, on the inside And though they're easily to blame And I'm just listening in on the inside And when you're old Tell me what they'll say Tell me what they'll say on the inside So be still You will find out From living down on the inside I'm easily amused by what you use By what you use for the outside And it's silver and gold And diamonds, I suppose On the inside You're silver and gold and diamonds, I Suppose Shining from the inside
