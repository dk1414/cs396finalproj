Here I stand, a man not free Whip markers on my back, shackles on both feet Picking cotton in the stone heat Pray the lord my soul keep for one day he came and told me In the year of 1831 I awoke at dawn To see his vision in the sun It seemed that the clouds parted to reveal his tongue And he said "My son, the revolution has begun"And with that, I knew the message was clear We'll kill the oppressor who kept us in prison for years Raped our women and laughed at our tears Made us build their meal while they sit back in their chairs Late night, I planned with my peers, we build weapons No guns, we must slice them from neck to the ears With spears, so they can hear The pain of the people who are God's creation, not theirsx2 I'm the one that they don't teach you in class about I'm the one who ran up in the master's house Put a knife to his neck and then gagged his mouth Charged him for black murder, I'm Nat Turner Through the darkness, we march like hellions They called it a massacre, I call a rebellion We moved quickly, with no time to spare Bloodlust, leave no life to spare Women and children neither After we freed our brothers we burned down the house to ensure no survivors On horseback we rode, blood dripping from the hooves Head out 'till dawn, positioned in the woods Then we attack again, ravaged them The blades slashed against the master's plaster skin The murder was so passionate Screaming to the heavens, we would never ever go back again Word began to spread of the violent mob That brought forth the wicked into the side of God This was where the demise begins It was written, my tale would only succumb to a violent endYeah It's the sound of Philadelphia Yo, yo Welcome to the home of brotherly love Brothers covered in blood The man's office is covered in bugs The youth dreams cut short, swept under the rug Love for self is outweighed by the love for the drugs Go Eagles, Mc Nabb and T.O We ain't hard to find homey, just follow the weed smoke We eat rolls of greased beef soaked, overweight and evil A city of justice unequal The shadow of New York we still under So we gotta kill 'em every summer, walk a little tougher Guns bustin' how we chose to fight When you can go from bein' a star to a scumbag overnight Streets often deserted on the coldest nights All hair trigger thunderbirds show you're right Cops don't ask if ya know your rights Hopeless hypes smokin' pipes Pavement gamblers rollin' dice Short sentence describe your whole life Low expectancy at a low price for a low life The mind of many years shines, soul so bright But they could give a fuck, in their crib no lights Everybody rhyme and they claim they don't write--it down Sit down, take it all in Civilization, this is where it all ends The city I call kin Yo, so take cautionAwooooooo  Buckaw  Scaw  Scaw  Buckaw!Do you hear that  Do you hear that !Oh, not the Chicken Man!He's gonna fucking kill us all!I am the best, come on say it with me:Fuck rappers, Reef is
