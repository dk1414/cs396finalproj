Man that joke was funny, maybe not but I depend on you That I might eat this lousy meal all alone always Wailing on a dinner date that smiles at me from miles away Man she's looking pretty don't you say That's always the way with her That's always the way That's always the way with her The way with her, the way with her Tapped out but well intended with his new one I befriended I don't think she's gonna go my way Still I'll drive for hours to fall victim to her powers Eat my remains I don't care You've got some pretty on your faceHey Victoria, do you still hide my letters Under the mattress you lay on with him Do you even remember putting them there I'd say probably not But I'm here and I'm writing, by the light of the candle That I once used when I'd write you Oh Victoria, the girl in the flowered dress It seems you've forgotten - is this some kind of test And if so, I hope I'm doing well And on the Fourth of July while I sit and cry You and Mr  Wonderful can have the time of your lives Oh Victoria, did you have a good time in France Hey don't worry, 'cause nothing's going to change - you said Words in the wind, well they certainly do come easy Eight months now I've been waiting for you to come around Beating my head against the wall - you never believed me Why would you worry  Why would you worry All in all, I'd still say thank you  You showed me a life I never knew All in all, I'd still say I love you  All in all, I surrender All in allYour strange fascination with the obvious Makes you as startling as a window Your keen sense of being oblivious Shows that you've nothing to hide From what I became to what I'll become To what I once was having seen some I went over the salt that's combined between us From up there all you see is clouds That might be bad Nothing like bliss After the aging's done, wonder how much I'd miss To live beyond the ever lessening mercies of others The shoulders that look our way they scream out try solitude The piss whores in the newsroom Got a knack for starting fires They'll cut out your heart with a chainsaw And shit it out over the wires That might be bad Nothing like bliss After the aging's done wonder how much I'd miss To live beyond the ever lessening mercies of others The shoulders that look our way they scream out try solitude When the helping hands reach out and take hold of the pillow that smothers Heaven help us all who understandSundown and we're high for the tenth time today We get by thanks to patience, just a little disappointed Far from dumb more blessed than some - boil the water your turn to cook Wide awake, piece of cake, we're sorry neighbors Spread it around, get the word out how you got the best of me It's no easy task I'll give you that but I know when the joke's on me Thanks for the excuse for all the abuse, you're just what I always needed A scapegoat for yours truly to call his very own In comes the sun, day begun whether I want it to or not I tried to run off bury the past leave it behind but I got caught The little voice you got that won't stop egging me on I've done things out of desperation, become gainfully employed And I took this voice for granted, now it's nearly destroyed But at least I've got a new bed to just lie on and fade Maybe it's me who's stupid here for everything I've saidCrystalline chandeliers hang from your sleeping eyes Each stone seems more than a crystal to me They're more like diamonds that you have wiped within your angel kissed skin Far too many time these rigid stones, these diamond tears With the numbers so great They've formed the chandeliers from you All these jagged years so mean So lean of interludes of delight Many an eve you've wept 'til blue Many more you've held your feelings in tight Deep down within you carry other's sins And you cry to the man who sits up high So many worries see joy pass in flurries Can leave you wrinkled to dieMy hair grows in a fashion, makes my mother think I'm taking drugs I can only say she's mostly wrong And I'm not quite sure how to cope with my current situation In this place that I keep saying I belong And I do not think I'll be Discussed elegantly Won't you please tell me How does it feel to be charmed, worry free as can be Throw the world down on their knees kissing your rings Have it all handed to you, watch it all go kabloo Yes I'd feel stupid too, Aesop's job is done Brilliance comes and brilliance goes but you're the only one who knows'Cause nothing draws them in like sympathy And as for all the broken ones who make their ways with poison tongues The pillow they sleep on is misery But you will not see me Being steered to a tree In this land of the free How does it feel to be charmed, worry free as can be Throw the world down on their knees kissing your rings Have it all handed to you, watch it all go kabloo Yes I'd feel stupid too, Aesop's job is done And I do not think I'll be Discussed elegantly Won't you please tell meArnie works the cyclone at the state fair Says he's in it for the chicks Smokes about two packs of cigarettes each day And he drinks just like a fish Arnie never talks of family And he never found a wife He sleeps with the bearded lady So does the guy that swallows knives Oh and I, I'm quite a lot like him Oh and I, I'm quite a lot like him Oh and I, I'm quite a lot like him-I swear Arnie talks as if someday he'll leave If the right thing comes along A distant dream as a mercenary marine Is a dream that's long gone My eyes, my eyes they're not like his Maybe a little God, I wish my eyes were just like his Arnie's on the road eight months each year Winters down south where it's warm He's in a trailer park in Sarasota Getting drunk with the clownsMan that joke was funny, maybe not but I depend on you That I might eat this lousy meal all alone always Wailing on a dinner date that smiles at me from miles away Man she's looking pretty don't you say That's always the way with her That's always the way That's always the way with her The way with her, the way with her Tapped out but well intended with his new one I befriended I don't think she's gonna go my way Still I'll drive for hours to fall victim to her powers Eat my remains I don't care You've got some pretty on your faceHey Victoria, do you still hide my letters Under the mattress you lay on with him Do you even remember putting them there I'd say probably not But I'm here and I'm writing, by the light of the candle That I once used when I'd write you Oh Victoria, the girl in the flowered dress It seems you've forgotten -
