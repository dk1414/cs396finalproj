I was scared of dentists and the dark I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations Oh, all my friends are turning green You're the magician's assistant in their dream Oh, oh-o-oh, and they come unstuck Lady, running down to the riptide Taken away to the dark side I wanna be your left hand man I love you, when you're singing that song and I got a lump in my throat 'cause You're gonna sing the words wrong There's this movie that I think you'll like This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City This cowboy's running from himself And she's been living on the highest shelf Oh, oh-o-oh, and they come unstuckShe is something to behold Elegant and bold She is electricity Running to my soul, oh And I could easily lose my mind The way you kiss me will work each time Calling me to come back to bed Singing "Georgia On My Mind"And I And I Lips generous and warm You build me up like steps Eyes innocent and wild Remind me what it's like, oh And I could easily lose my mind The way you kiss me will work each time Pulling me back into the flames And I'm burning up again, I'm burning upTalking like we used to do It was always me and you Shaping up and shipping out Check me in and check me out Do you like walking in the rain When you think of love, do you think of pain You can tell me what you see I will choose what I believe Well, hold on, darling This body is yours This body is yours and mine Well, hold on, my darling This mess was yours Now your mess is mine Ah, ooh Your mess is mine See you in the marketplace Walkin 'round at 8:00am I got two hours before my flight Luck, be on my side tonight You're the reason that I feel so strong The reason that I'm hanging on You know you gave me all that time Well, did I give enough of mine I saw you standing there Sandy blonde hair, the way it came tumbling down Just like a waterfall And if you need a light I'll be the match to your candle My darling, I'm ready, to burst into flames for you I was just coasting till we met You remind me just how good it can get Well I've been on fire, dreaming of you Tell me you don't It feels like you do Looking like that, you'll open some wounds How does it start And when does it end Only been here for a moment, but I know I want you But is it too soon To know that I'm with you There's nothing I can do And sometime around one We fell asleep to escape from the sun And we woke up to the sound of a storm outside We stood at your front door You looked at me and said "Baby, this rain changes everything"And my heart ran away from meI was only walking through your neighbourhood Saw your light on, honey, in the cold I stood Anywhere I go, there you are Anywhere I go, there you are I've been getting used to waking up with you I've been getting used to waking up here Anywhere I go, there you are Anywhere I go, there you are There you are, there you are, mm You're the fire and the flood And I always feel you in my blood Everything is fine When your head's resting next to mine, next to mine You're the fire and the flood Ah-ooh, ooh, ooh Ah-ooh, ooh, ooh Since we met, I feel a lightness in my step You're miles away, but I still feel you Anywhere I go, there you are Anywhere I go, there you are Late at night, when you can't fall asleep I'll be lying right beside you, counting sheep Anywhere I go, there you are Anywhere I go, there you are There you are, there you are, mmI'm so gone Anyone could see that I'm wasted You cut through And I just wanna know what's in your head Write it on a piece of paper, honey, mmm Put it in my coat before I go Hidden in a place you know I'll find it, oh ohh Later when I'm sitting all alone Let me in Everything starts at your skin, so new Your love's always finding me out Who am I kidding If all my defences come down, oh baby Will you lay it all on me now Lay it all on me now Lay it all on me now Lay it all on me now Snow comes down Everything is new And different I found you Hidden in plain sight Why'd I take so long Write it on a piece of paper, honey, mmm Put it in my coat before I goOh, Saturday Sun I met someone Out on the West Coast I gotta get back, I can't let this go Oh, Saturday Sun I met someone Don't care what it costs No ray of sunlight's ever lost So tired of sleepin' alone So tired of eatin' alone I need to ask her what's goin' on Are we goin' strong She felt like resting her head My shoulder was the perfect height We fit so right, so what's goin' on 'Cause I've been undone The long drive, the coastline Lookin' out at first light Am I still on her mind I've been undoneTime to let it go It won't let go of me Hanging by a thread Cutting the cord and then falling back into the Black 'cause if I don't If I wait 'til it feels right I'll be waiting my whole life Closing my eyes, remember how we were like Gold, when you see me Hi, if you need me Babe, that's the way it was That's the history Blue, how we used to roar Like an open fire That's the way it was But that's history O-o-o-o-o-o O-o-o-o-o That's the way it was But that's history O-o-o-o-o-o O-o-o-o-o That's the way it was But that's historyI love you in the morning when the blood runs to your cheeks Babe, you are the first thing and the last thing that I'd see I was just a boy striking matches upon your heart I couldn't get no sparks Ask me to go faster, put my foot down to the floor Standing at the edge, I feel like I been here before Loved you in the darkness and I loved you in fluorescent light If it don't feel right, babe You can run and hide, babe Like a bird, you can take flight If I've been holding on too tight If I've been holding on Mmm, oooh Oooh, oooh, ooooh Your mother always told us we should go out to the dance You can't get struck by lightning if you're not standing in the rain Take it as the truth or you can take it with a grain of salt If it don't work out You were in the shower we were talking through the glass Packing up your suitcase, you were humming to yourself One day you were smiling, I could tell by how you sounded on the phone You said "I'm coming home, babe"Under the surface you don't know what you'll find Hmm, until it's your time No second chances but all we can do is try Hmm, I made up my mind I can't see you But I hear your call Baby, hold on now We're going home If we make it or we don't, we won't be alone When I see your light shine, I know I'm home If you're waiting all your life, you won't ever go When I see your light shine, I know I'm home When I see your light shine, I know I'm home When I see your light shine Some things are simple and hard to ignore They say, hmm, the truth is like that We're getting colder, so far from the shore I say, hmm, the world is like that
