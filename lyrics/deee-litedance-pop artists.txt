]The chills that you spill up my back keep me filled With satisfaction when we're done Satisfaction of what's to come I couldn't ask for another No, I couldn't ask for another Your groove I do deeply dig No walls, only the bridge My supper dish, my succotash wish I couldn't ask for another No, I couldn't ask for another Groove is in the heart Groove is in the heart Groove is in the heart Groove is in the heartWhat is love What is love I think I know what love is I think I know what love is I think I know I think What is love What is love Mm, how do you say Delicious, de-lovely Delectable, divine How do you say De-gorgeous, de-with it De-groovy, define Ooh-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la Love is love How do you say delicious How do you say de-lovely How do you say delectable, divine How do you say de-groovy, de-with it How do you say Deee-LiteMushrooms Caterpillars Dewdrops in the garden All day in my mind I replay the second time we chimed So sweet what a treat sensual Skin on skin is swingingly swell Fat treasures Don't compare to our pleasures Kissing and suckling The boots come unbuckling Enter sexual altered states No sleeping we're staying awake The music connects us The rubber protects us And what the neighbors think, just doesn't effect us Check my spot and dig my swirl I'm a liberated girl I need your loving I want your love I'll be your friend I'll be your loverKissin' in the back row How we missed the movie Said you had cottonmouth That apple juice was groovy Splish smack on my lips Apple juice kissin' makes me roll my hips Kissin' in the doorway Nowhere else to play Cottonmouth pillow lips Better take a swig of this Splish smack on my lips Apple juice kissin makes me roll my hips Easy to love, our love will find a way Easy to love, our love is here to stay Easy to love, our love will find a way Easy to love, our love is here to stay Ub-dub dubby-dub, dubby-dubby-dubby Ub-dub dubby-dub, dubby-dubby-dubby Dubby dubby Ubby dubby, ubby dubby Lovey dovey, loveyI believe in the power of love I believe in the power of love I believe in the power of love I believe in the power of love Feel the power Let the people call me naive I believe I believe I believe I believe Hey What is it that can make a lost soul found Love And what is it that can make the coldest day seem warm Love And what is it that can bring a smile through to strangers Love Love Love Love I believe in the power of love I believe in the power of love I believe in the power of love Let them call me naïve But I still believeWalk with me until we find the right spot Our little excursion picnic in the park Feet in the grass until it gets dark That’s when I saw the fireflies spark The popsicle stick is finally smooth Hop on a lily pad for the summer groove Walking arm and arm, so glad you came along Check out the curly vine The blanket was too small, but you call me baby doll I could kiss you all the time Watchin' people have a good time Watchin' people have a good time in the summertime Flying picnic blanket in the summer groove Watchin' people have a good time Watchin' people have a good time in the summertime No interruptions we’re all alone'Cause I don’t have a cellular phone Sweatin your pose, wiggling your toes Come at me like a panther'Cause you know yes is my answerWhen you told me you loved me Did you mean it When you told me you loved me Didn't you mean it First you kissed me on the elevator Then you said you'd see me later Now I haven't heard from you And it's obvious we're through Why'd you have to say You loved me in that way And I got that empty feeling It stays with me each day It seems to follow me around While your on the other side of town When you told me you loved me Did you mean it When you told me you loved me Didn't you mean it All the lies about the situation Left me wondering in desperation Now I know that I've been true But it's not the same for you Why'd you have to say You loved me in that way Now I haven't heard from you And my hopes are turning blue And I got that empty feeling That stays with me each day It seems to follow me around While you're on the other side of townI love the way you love me You sexy thing I love the way you love me I love the way you touch me You sexy thing I believe in miracles Since you came along, baby You sexy thing, you sexy thing, you I believe in miracles Where you from You sexy thing Where did you come from, baby How did you know I needed you How did ya know I needed you so badly How did ya know I give up my heart gladly Yesterday I was one of a lonely people Now you're lying close to me Makin' love to mePsst When you bite your bottom lip I wanna do back flips Kiss your belly button and show you some good loving It wouldn't matter if we got arrested Our love is time-proven and perfected I like it when you show me The endurance of a tantric yogi You got your chocolate in my peanut butter Spreading love with your eyelash flutter Always ready when you hold me steady Unplug the phone Press my buzzer and ring my bell Just me and you, pretending we're not home You make me wanna write these crazy love poems Can't get no rest cause you know I'm with the best Always ready when you hold me steady Keeping me on the verge Just in time to stop while we still got the urge Give me your spice Snuggle up to me it feels niceI've never felt so free I've never felt so free I've never felt so free before You can't stop me from walking out the door I've never felt so free before You can't stop me from walking out the door I've never felt so free before We'll put the bad times behind us C'mon, put some sugar and stir it up Put it in sugar and stir it up Put some sugar and stir it up I know we're gonna make it better No more bittersweet loving No, no, no, no, no, no No more, no, no, no, no, no, no I've never felt so free I've never felt so free I've never felt so free before
