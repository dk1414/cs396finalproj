I would react badly to the slightest hint of hesitance He'd bend awkwardly to suit my mood, no word from his defense I'd cry knowing how my tears felt like acid burning through his skin Pushed every little button but the right one that would let me in Now he's afraid of me He's afraid of me It took me by surprise, the hatred in his eyes I've pushed this man as far as he could go But he lacked the words to let me know He acted out, now I concede it is my fault I made changes that went unnoticed, sang songs for deaf ears Mistook my silence for punishment, as it had been all these years I'd cry knowing how my tears felt like acid burning through his skin Now he's afraid of me He's afraid of me And it took me by surprise, the hatred in his eyes I've pushed this man as far as he could go But he lacked the words to let me know He acted out, now I can Took me by surprise, the hatred in his eyes I've pushed this man as far as he could go But he lacked the words to let me know He acted out, now I It took me by surprise The hatred in his eyes I've pushed this man as far as he could go But he lacked the words to let me know He acted out, now I concede it is my faultIt's a small town Word gets around And travels in circles Through hoops, over hurdles Everyone's careless They talk about our mess They don't care how it hurts me Must think it was easy They say you have a new love I'm happy for you, love I just don't wanna meet her Are you gonna keep her 'Cause I don't wanna see you with her I don't wanna see her face Resting in your embrace Her feet standing in my place I don't wanna see you moved on I don't think I'm that strong It hasn't been that long Since I was the one in your armsI wrote a song, a journal Gave it to the world Told the story Of when I was just a girl I sought understanding Clarity in truth By baring all the wounds Inflicted on my youth You criticized my choice To stand up to my past To give the pain a voice So that it too could pass But I felt brave And filled with pride as I let go Of bitterness that wouldnâ€™t leave or let me grow And I will spend a lifetime Trying to understand Why someone sharing my bloodline Would not lend me their hand Am I supposed to apologize Am I supposed to apologize No one will tell you 'bout the limit They put on how long you can grieve No one will warn you when you're winning How heavy a lost love can be They do not tell you 'bout the friendships You'll lose once the lights are dimmed down How humble you'll feel about your past bliss Once the tables have turned 'round But I wanna tell you I got through The hardest of times on my own I made some mistakes, I made a few But I learned that I am strong And just because it hurts Doesn't mean it isn't worth it And even if it stings, mmm It's just a temporary thing I'm not saying that changing Won't cost you love, won't make you cry But it will all make sense, mmm When the growing pains subsideI am a creature of habit And I move in circles around you I will admit there's a pattern One I've created myself'Cause none of my lovers dared leave me I grew impatient and stale Didn't look back once I'd left them'Cause I always expected to fail But this time it's different The rules don't apply But I need some distance to step out of line So grant me this wish and meet me back here in a year If we still exist, I can let go of my fear Fear of normalcy Fear of the solid walls of our future and let go of my past I must be crazy to want this'Cause you are the girl of my dreams But I'm prone to ruin the good things Cautious 'round balance it seemsComfortable as I am I need your reassurance Comfortable as you are You count the days But if I wanted silence, I would whisper And if I wanted loneliness, I'd choose to go And if I liked rejection, I'd audition And if I didn't love you, you would know And why can't you just hold me And how come it is so hard And do you like to see me broken And why do I still care, still care You say you see the light now At the end of this narrow hall And I wish it didn't matter I wish I didn't give you all But if I wanted silence, I would whisper And if I wanted loneliness, I'd choose to go And if I liked rejection, I'd audition And if I didn't love you, you would knowSelf-hatred grows in me like cancer I can't locate its whereabouts but it's feasting on its host I expected him to have the answers I thought I taught him how to love me Now he fears me like a ghost Self-fulfilling prophecy You're the only guaranteed loyalty In this town Full of violent mothers Cheating fathers Leaving lovers I swear to you, I'll never love again This hunger grows inside me like a tumor The dizziness just compliments this failure of a girl I'm settled now, the show of mine consumes me But every pound I shed speaks volumes of my lack of self-control Self-fulfilling prophecy You're the only one that dare speak the truth about me In this town of Well-intentioned mothers Starving daughters Worried lovers I swear to you, I'll never eat againThe ugly naked truth:She starves me of my youth And I stand alone until You catch on I swear it's not by choice But Ana has this voice And it calms me down It gives me purpose And it's alright I'm alright I want to be okay I've seen it before This eyesore; it's me Ohh, ohh, ohh, me I want out from under This confining skin That I so reluc-tantly live in My worth is measured solely According to the scale I am heavy, but I feel frailCareful what you say This time of year tends to weaken me And have a little decency And let me cry in peace But there's a place where I Erase the challenges I've been through Where I know every corner Every street name all by heart And so it is a part of my Courageous plan to leave With a broken heart Tucked away under my sleeve I wanna go home for Christmas Let me go home this year I wanna go home for Christmas Let me go home this year I'll pack my bags and leave Before the sun rises tomorrow'Cause we act more like strangers For each day that I am here But I have people close to me Who never will desert me Who remind me frequently What I was like as a childI couldn't accept we were ending I gradually started to drift In the back of my mind was pretending That I could handle it I couldn't handle it Just wanted a moment of silence Not everything ending in war The tiniest problems made giant What were we fighting for What are we fighting for What I'm about to say Won't be easy to swallow What you felt today Will be as painful tomorrow Painful tomorrow Painful tomorrow It's enough, it's enough, it's enough for me It's enough, it's enough, it's enough, please you gotta see I'm leaving you, you I'm leaving you, you You're okay, you're okay, you're okay without me Comes a day, comes a day, comes a day that I'm convinced that you'll agree That I'm leaving you, you Leaving you, you
