Take my mother, my sister, my brother, and my first born son Ne' er do wells, everyone There's a fracture in the fabric of the family's old scotch pine But it will heal if given time I for one am a believer in the nod and shake We'll get on, it's never too late It's a part of your cult that I might keep for myself Turn the other cheek But not that but about your hell Because my blood's too rich for subway cars, and I'm too poor for a cab I'm too old for the girl I love but she doesn't know it yet When I die I will leave no shadows of regret I'm too tired to make amends that cannot go unsaidWell, I am a long-haul driver And I'm leaving at dawn I don't think that I will see you So I’ll leave the porch light on I know you land at eight o'clock But I'll be gone by five I'll be waving out the window As I pass the airport by Aw, yeah Because I am a long-haul driver And I'm leaving at dawn I don't think that I will see you So I’ll leave the porch light on Yeah Through Michigan to Illinois and Indiana, too I'll turn this rig towards the north but still away from you—Are waltzing in my mind's blue eye and strumming your guitar Two thousand miles between us Yet I'm never, ever that farIf I drop names of exotic towns that you'll never see, in the songs that I write, it's that that's all I have when I miss my girl and you're taking yours home tonightBroken records, buzzing flies, empty bottles Graphic evidence of a war as it heals Scratch the itch, pick the scab, don't let it seal This is a martyr's scar Oh and if I wallow here, it's my history to burn These are my lessons to learn but for now, one more round then I'll go I'll send you pictures of us when we were deluded, don't you think it was a beautiful high Look at Coco's princess dress, hazel eyes depict an optimistic, youthful alibi Oh, and if I wallow here, it's my history to burn These are my lessons to learn  But for now, one more round then I'll go So we made some plants, told the folks, told a lie or two, but that's all secondary stuff The disappointment was electric, but you don't know it because you've never been in love Oh, and if I wallow here, it's my history to burn  These are my lessons to learn, but for now, one more round than I'll goBrother, oh brother Will I see you again When I left you on Walnut St  you were a wabted man Brother, oh brother Where will you lay your head under a velvet Jesus Just to keep you safe from death Brother, oh brother What is the crime you done Did you consort with the devil via cocaine and a gun Oh brother, oh brother No shame and no surprise, we all expect the unexpected from the bo who never cries Brother, oh brother You watch your fragile back The vultures, they are circling You know the ones in black Brother, oh brother Never will they tire Fortunes built on laying the guilt for the heat inside of a fire Brother, oh brother The rumour is a man who looks just like you was seen with a six shot in his hand He was drunker than Arbuckle and he was highter than Chang Only by the grace of God will I see you again Brother, oh brother You are not the killing type, so I will pray for your forgiveness if they string you up tonight Brother, oh brother Will I see ou again When I left you at Walnut St  you were a wanted manIt takes a uniquely fucked up man to break his own heart and the right girl at the wrong time to make him do it So if I am that guy and you're the girl and the time is now, then I'm as broke as any man could be So take my cigarettes, take my alcohol, take my heroin, let me feel again You were never my whole world, just one of many girls Maybe I've had too many lately I've been drinking at the Wrecking Yard, fallind down drunk with better men While my conscience deals your sorry guilty head another blow A drunkard takes it all in like a friend Oh darlin', it's no secret in this small town the company you keep When the sandman calls and while your new guy's reading cue cards to fill my old part, you're gonna kill him off when the ratings start to fall So bring me cigarettes, bring me alcohol, bring me heroin, makes me feel again You were never my whole world, you're just one of many girls, maybe I've had too manyI'm a drunkard, I'm a loser, a talker, I'm a dreamer with conquered gray eyes I'm a young man who sweats out the D T's, there's no love to be made here now I had a girl with no eyes but for Paris and a man with with an antique bassoon And while she pulls at my heart strings for the lack of fresh blood, there's no love to be made here now Last call, drink up, go home fools, blinded by liquor and fear of an old life with no love, no one to hold you and tell you this love was triumphant and pure Well, she walks with the legs of a dancer, where its forever ten minutes to two At last call, she swoons to an old rain dog tune, there'll be love to be made here now So I will lie here awake in my bed, until the children have all gone to play, then for two precious hours I will dream of a world where there's love to be made here now There's love to be made here now What of the girl in the painting, where did her dear heart go Off in the hills with her fear and her wonder There's no love to be made here now Where is the boy in the plate glass, where did his body go He gave it away to a north country harlot, there's no love to be made here now There's no love to be made here nowKeep her away from me Keep her away from me'cause I'm not man enough to keep my hands where I can see them I did the wrong brother, just like my mother do That's why I don't have your name, but I got the same eyes as you I got the same eyes..  can't get your money backOne day you're gonna miss me One day you're gonna wake up cold Then you'll wish that you could kiss me when you're old and you're alone So cry if you want to Yeah, you can come undone but you've gotta have a heart to have a broken one You can take your accusations You can have all your records back You can have an opinion or a heart attack'cause if you lose a kindred spirit, you'll find another one But you've gotta to pull the trigger to have a smoking gun Oh my girl, it must be so tight in your skin 'cause there's no room to breathe- this fantasy you're living in I need a new perpective, I need a fresh start I need a girl like you like a stolen car because we all love the joyride until you wind up dead You see, you don't need a heart to have a swollen headVladivostok bathing in the midnight sun Atlantis up on my dry docks, and fish with guns A monkey takes the reins of th an empire  with daddy's gold bananas, he's a monarch The winds of change are so pollute I'm afraid there's nowhere left to turn With paradise paved and the starts ablaze, the captain turns the no smoking sign off, it doesn't matter, we're going down Now, smoke, people..  burn the last one down Shall I exercise my right to disapprove of all your tricks by calling on the brotherhood to rise When the kindly sisters take the night back in defiance of you, you'll have served the needs of all your kin
