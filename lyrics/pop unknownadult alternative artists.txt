It's as if you've taken everything  and turned it into this  something no one here can translate for you  maybe if i had a clue  of what to do with you  i'd make it better for you somehow  one step back  you've faded off again  falling down and losing insight  one step back  you've faded off again  crashing down into a new life  when she walks into a room  coming back for more  everyone around is watching  standing tall she's got a view  eyeing everyone  making sure she finds a new one  what's been said and done is over now  so let's just let it be  going over things inside of you  what's inside of me  breaking out into a new life  a new found end to this  something both of us can cling to now  one step better  one step closer to the endWho'd of thought that it would get like this  You've seen better days  A claustrophobic kind of head trip  Take another look around you  You've seen better days  There's nothing here that I would ever miss  You'll find you need another holiday  In time you'll see it's just another day  You'll find you need another holiday  In time you see it's just a better way  It's getting harder to get out of bed  You've seen better days  Head grows heavy under pillow  Call in sick there's been a change in plans  You've seen better days  Throw your T V out your window  You'll find you need another holiday  In time you see it's just a better way  You'll find you need another holiday  In time you'll see it's just a better way  Get connected, Get Connected  Get connected, Get connected or it won't change  You'll find in time you've had enough to pick up and get away  You've had enough to pick up and get away  In time you see it's just a better way  You'll find you need another holiday  In time you'll see it's just a better wayI'll follow you  follow you  oh anywhere  anywhere  where are you going to  going to  i'll follow you  follow you  she's leaving meI can't sleep tonight  eyes wide open  one hundred and six degrees  take me away  speak softly  hide your clock from me  i don't want to get up just yet  cause bedside manner doesn't matter  it doesn't matter anyway  bye bye bye goodnightIn forty-five  i'll come back for the pieces  you won't have to compromise  you won't have to pay the price  and with that in mind  i'd throw it all away  forever is a long time  you know it won't come easily  and with a forty-five  i'll come back here on my own  to find you waiting here for me  so nice  you've been waiting there for me  so nice  and with that in mind  i'll take you far away  somewhere for a long time  never looking back again  get up and go there  cause i'll be right there for you  i miss you beautiful  and i can taste your kiss  something tells me  i may never see you here againTrip to find an offering  you're all i know  some familiar facesInto a hydroplane I spin until I'm out of breath  And you know you're the one who's got me twisting on the inside  Take another look and know that I'll be waiting there  Cause you know..  All the while it's all the same line in your down time  You can hide yourself inside your perfect little shell  Scratching at the wall you built around yourself  You can hide away inside your perfect little world  Scratching at the walls you built around yourself  Done nothing wrong I only blame myself  Into a hydroplane I'm beaten to the ground  You've done nothing wrong I only blame myself  Into a hydroplane at the speed of sound  I fall downIt's as if you've taken everything  and turned it into this  something no one here can translate for you  maybe if i had a clue  of what to do with you  i'd make it better for you somehow  one step back  you've faded off again  falling down and losing insight  one step back  you've faded off again  crashing down into a new life  when she walks into a room  coming back for more  everyone around is watching  standing tall she's got a view  eyeing everyone  making sure she finds a new one  what's been said and done is over now  so let's just let it be  going over things inside of you  what's inside of me  breaking out into a new life  a new found end to this  something both of us can cling to now  one step better  one step closer to the end
