Now the seats are all empty Let the roadies take the stage Pack it up and tear it down They're the first to come and last to leave Working for that minimum wage They'll set it up in another town Tonight the people were so fine They waited there in line And when they got up on their feet they made the show And that was sweet But I can hear the sound Of slamming doors and folding chairs And that's a sound they'll never know Now roll them cases out and lift them amps And haul them trusses down and get 'em up them ramps'Cause when it comes to moving me You know you guys are the champs But when that last guitar's been packed away You know that I still wanna play So just make sure you got it all set to go Before you come for my pianoWell I've been out walking I don't do that much talking these days These days These days I seem to think a lot About the things that I forgot to do For you And all the times I had the chance to And I had a lover But it's so hard to risk another these days These days Now if I seem to be afraid To live the life that I have made in song Well it's just that I've been losing For so long Well I'll keep on moving Moving on Things are bound to be improving These days One of these days These days I'll sit on cornerstones And count the time in quarter tones to ten My friend Don't confront me with my failures I had not forgotten themI'm gonna rent myself a house In the shade of the freeway Gonna pack my lunch in the morning And go to work each day And when the evening rolls around I'll go on home and lay my body down And when the morning light comes streaming in I'll get up and do it again Amen Say it again Amen I want to know what became of the changes We waited for love to bring Were they only the fitful dreams Of some greater awakening I've been aware of the time going by They say in the end it's the wink of an eye And when the morning light comes streaming in You'll get up and do it again Amen Caught between the longing for love And the struggle for the legal tender Where the sirens sing And the church bells ring And the junkman pounds his fender Where the veterans dream of the fight Fast asleep at the traffic light And the children solemnly wait For the ice cream vendorLooking out at the road rushing under my wheels Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields In '65, I was seventeen and running up 101 I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on Running on, running on empty Running on, running blind Running on, running into the sun But I'm running behind Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive In '69, I was twenty-one and I called the road my own I don't know when that road turned onto the road I'm on Running on, running on empty Running on, running blind Running on, running into the sun But I'm running behindWell, just a-look at that girl With the lights comin' up in her eyes She's got to be somebody's baby She must be somebody's baby All the guys on the corner stand back And let her walk on by She's got to be somebody's baby She must be somebody's baby She's got to be somebody's baby She's so fine She's probably somebody's only light Gonna shine tonight Yeah, she's probably somebody's baby, all right I heard her talkin' with her friend When she thought nobody else was around She said she's got to be somebody's baby She must be somebody's babyâ€˜Cause when the cars and the signs and the streetlights Light up the town She's got to be somebody's baby She must be somebody's baby She's got to be somebody's baby She's soNow the words had all been spoken And somehow the feeling still wasn't right And still we continued on through the night Tracing our steps from the beginning Until they vanished into the air Trying to understand how our lives had led us there Looking hard into your eyes There was nobody I'd ever known Such an empty surprise To feel so alone Now for me some words come easy But I know that they don't mean that much Compared with the things that are said when lovers touch You never knew what I loved in you I don't know what you loved in me Maybe the picture of somebody you were hoping I might be Awake again, I can't pretend And I know I'm alone And close to the end Of the feeling we've knownDoctor, my eyes have seen the years And the slow parade of fears without crying Now I want to understand I have done all that I could To see the evil and the good without hiding You must help me if you can Doctor, my eyes Tell me what is wrong Was I unwise to leave them open for so long 'Cause I have wandered through this world And as each moment has unfurled I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams People go just where they will I never noticed them until I got this feeling That it's later than it seems Doctor, my eyes Tell me what you see I hear their cries Just say if it's too late for meEverybody I talk to is ready to leave With the light of the morning They've seen the end coming down long enough to believe That they've heard their last warning Standing alone Each has his own ticket in his hand And as the evening descends I sit thinking 'bout Everyman Seems like I've always been looking for some other place To get it together Where with a few of my friends I could give up the race And maybe find something better But all my fine dreams Well thought out schemes to gain the motherland Have all eventually come down to waiting for Everyman Waiting here for Everyman Make it on your own if you think you can If you see somewhere to go I understand Waiting here for Everyman Don't ask me if he'll show Baby I don't knowKeep a fire burning in your eye And pay attention to the open sky You never know what will be coming down I don't remember losing track of you You were always dancing in and out of view I must've thought you'd always be around Always keeping things real by playing the clown Now you're nowhere to be found I don't know what happens when people die Can't seem to grasp it as hard as I try It's like a song I can hear playing right in my ear that I can't sing I can't help listening And I can't help feeling stupid standing 'round Crying as they ease you down'Cause I know that you'd rather we were dancing Dancing our sorrow away No matter what fate chooses to play Just do the steps that you've been shown By everyone you've ever known Until the dance becomes your very own No matter how close to yours another's steps have grown In the end, there is one dance you'll do aloneYou take Sally and I'll take Sue There ain't no difference between the two Cocaine, running all 'round my brain Headin' down Scott, turnin' up Main Looking for that girl who sells cocaine Cocaine, runnin' all 'round my brain Mmm momma come here quick That old cocaine 'bout to make me sick Cocaine, runnin' all 'round my brain Late last night about a quarter past four Ladanyi come knockin' down my hotel room door Where's the cocaine Said it's runnin' all 'round my brain I was talking to my doctor down at the hospital He said, "Son, it says here you're twenty-seven But that's impossible Cocaine, you look like you could be forty-five"
