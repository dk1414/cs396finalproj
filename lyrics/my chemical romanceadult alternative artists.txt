When I was a young boy, my father Took me into the city to see a marching band He said, "Son, when you grow up, would you be The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned "He said, "Will you defeat them, your demons And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom To lead you in the summer to join the black parade"When I was a young boy, my father Took me into the city to see a marching band He said, "Son, when you grow up, would you be The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned "Sometimes, I get the feeling she's watching over me And other times, I feel like I should go And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets And when you're gone, we want you all to know We'll carry on, we'll carry on And though you're dead and gone, believe me Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on And in my heart, I can't contain it The anthem won't explain itLong ago, just like the hearse you die to get in again We are so far from you Burning on, just like the match you strike to incinerate The lives of everyone you know And what's the worst you take From every heart you break  And like the blade you stain Well, I've been holding on tonight What's the worst that I can say Things are better if I stay So long and goodnight So long, not goodnight Came a time when every star fall brought you to tears again We are the very hurt you sold And what's the worst you take From every heart you break  And like the blade you stain Well, I've been holding on tonightThey're gonna clean up your looks with all the lies in the books To make a citizen out of you Because they sleep with a gun and keep an eye on you, son So they can watch all the things you do Because the drugs never work, they're gonna give you a smirk'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean They're gonna rip up your heads, your aspirations to shreds Another cog in the murder machine They said, "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me The boys and girls in the clique, the awful names that they stick You're never gonna fit in much, kid But if you're troubled and hurt, what you got under your shirt Will make them pay for the things that they did They said, "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me, oh, yeahSee the man who stands upon the hill He dreams of all the battles won But fate had left its scars upon his face With all the damage they had done And so time with age It turns the page Let the flesh Submit itself to gravity Let our bodies lay, mark our hearts with shame Let our blood in vain, you find God in pain Now, if your convictions were a passing faith May your ashes feed the river in the morning rays And as the vermin crawls We lay in the foundations of decay He was there, the day the towers fell And so he wandered down the road And we would all build towers of our own Only to watch the roots corrodeWell, if you wanted honesty That's all you had to say I never want to let you down Or have you go, it's better off this way For all the dirty looks The photographs your boyfriend took Remember when you broke your foot From jumping out the second floor I'm not okay I'm not okay I'm not okay You wear me out What will it take to show you That it's not the life it seems  I've told you time and time again You sing the words, but don't know what it means Mama, we all go to Hell Mama, we all go to Hell I'm writing this letter and wishing you well Mama, we all go to Hell Oh well, now, Mama, we're all gonna die Mama, we're all gonna die Stop asking me questions, I'd hate to see you cry Mama, we're all gonna die And when we go, don't blame us, yeah We'll let the fires just bathe us, yeah You made us oh so famous We'll never let you go And when you go, don't return to me, my love Mama, we're all full of lies Mama, we're meant for the flies And right now, they're building a coffin your size Mama, we're all full of lies Well, mother, what the war did to my legs and to my tongue You should've raised a baby girl, I should've been a better son If you could coddle the infection, they can amputate at once You should've been, I could have been a better sonI never said I'd lie in wait forever If I died, we'd be together, now I can't always just forget her But she could try At the end of the world or the last thing I see You are never coming home, never coming home Could I  Should I And all the things that you never ever told me And all the smiles that are ever, ever Ever get the feeling that you're never all alone And I remember now At the top of my lungs in my arms, she dies, she dies At the end of the world or the last thing I see You are never coming home, never coming home Could I  Should I And all the things that you never ever told me And all the smiles that are ever gonna haunt me Never coming home, never coming home Could I  Should I And all the wounds that are ever gonna scar me For all the ghosts that are never gonna catch meWell, when you go Don't ever think I'll make you try to stay And maybe when you get back I'll be off to find another way And after all this time that you still owe You're still a good-for-nothing, I don't know So take your gloves and get out Better get out while you can When you go, and would you even turn to say"I don't love you like I did yesterday"?Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading So sick and tired of all the needless beating But baby, when they knock you down and out Is where you oughta stay And after all the blood that you still owe Another dollar's just another blow So fix your eyes and get up Better get up while you can, whoa, whoa, whoaTurn away If you could, get me a drink Of water 'cause my lips are chapped and faded Call my Aunt Marie Help her gather all my things And bury me in all my favorite colors My sisters and my brothers, still I will not kiss you'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you Now turn away'Cause I'm awful just to see'Cause all my hair's abandoned all my body Oh, my agony Know that I will never marry Baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo But counting down the days to go It just ain't living And I just hope you knowNow, I know that I can't make you stay But where's your heart But where's your heart But where's yourâ€”And I know there's nothing I can say To change that part To change that part To change So many bright lights to cast a shadow But can I speak Well, is it hard understanding I'm incomplete A life that's so demanding I get so weak A love that's so demanding I can't speak I am not afraid to keep on living I am not afraid to walk this world alone Honey, if you stay, you'll be forgiven Nothing you can say can stop me going home
