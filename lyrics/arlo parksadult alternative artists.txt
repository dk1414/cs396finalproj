I'd lick the grief right off your lips You do your eyes like Robert Smith Sometimes it seems like you won't survive this And honestly it's terrifying Let's go to the corner store and buy some fruit I would do anything to get you out your room Just take your medicine and eat some food I would do anything to get you out your room It's so cruel What your mind can do for no reason I'd take a jump off the fire escape To make the black dog go away Alice, I know that you are trying But that's what makes it terrifying Let's go to the corner store and buy some fruit I would do anything to get you out your room Just take your medicine and eat some food I would do anything to get you out your roomYeah I had a dream we kissed And it was all amethyst The underpart of your eyes was violet You hung a cigarette between your purple lips We've been best buds since thirteen I hold your hair back when you're too lean I hold the Taco Bell and you cried over Eugene He was mean He was mean Hey, I know I've been a little bit off and that's my mistake I kind of fell half in love and you're to blame I guess I just forgot that we've been mates since day Yeah, I don't know what to say Hey, I know I've been a little bit off and that's my mistake I kind of fell half in love and you're to blame I guess I just forgot that we've been mates since day Yeah, I don't know what to sayI was waiting for the bus one day Watched a fight between an artsy couple escalate Strawberry cheeks flushed with defeated rage Then he spilled his coffee as he frantically explained Maybe if you took a breath You would hear me when I talk to you Threw her necklace in his face Eyes so bright with disappointment I saw something inside her break Everybody knows the feeling Suddenly he started screaming"Caroline I swear to God I tried I swear to God I tried Caroline I swear to God I tried I swear to God I tried"I swear to God I tried I swear to God I tried"Mmm, mmm Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm Charlie drank it till his eyes burned Then forgot to eat his lunch Pain was built into his body Heart so soft it hurt to beat Oh, wouldn't it be lovely to feel something for once Yeah, wouldn't it be lovely to feel worth something, huh I know you can't let go Of anything at the moment Just know it won't hurt so Won't hurt so much forever Won't hurt so much Won't hurt so much forever Won't hurt so much Won't hurt so much Charlie melts into his mattress Watching Twin Peaks on his ones Then his fingers find the bottle When he starts to miss his mumLeave me to my own devices It's better when your coca-cola eyes are out of my face I checked your phone and no surprises She's grinning from ear to ear in purple lace So take your orchids Elsewhere, elsewhere I loved you to death But now I don't really care'Cause you're running 'round over there Yeah, you're running 'round over there And now I don't really care'Cause you're running 'round over there And now I don't really care'Cause you're running 'round over there I'll miss your t-shirt in the rain The one that makes you look like Gerard Way Eating grapes in the back of the party Throwing hands 'cause she drank your Bacardi I know it's kinda dumb but I'll miss the way you dressed all punk With the black and the studs and the ripped up clothes Bet she loved your tough guy frontMillie tried to talk the pleasure back into being alive Reminiscing 'bout the apricots and blunts on Peckham Rye Won't call her friends 'cause she's ashamed of being locked into bed Can't feel her legs and feeling like a liar at best You're not alone like you think you are You're not alone like you think you are We all have scars, I know it's hard You're not alone, you're not alone You're not alone like you think you are You're not alonе like you think you are We all havе scars, I know it's hard You're not alone, you're not alone You're not alone, you're not alone Started sweating bullets when her dad asked, "How d'you really feel "She said, "I've been feeling like something inside me wants to scream"Won't call my friends, I'm persuaded that they'll leave in the end Can't feel my legs, I'm feeling like a liar at best You're not alone like you think you are You're not alone like you think you are We all have scars, I know it's hard You're not alone, you're not alone You're not alone like you think you are You're not alone like you think you are We all have scars, I know it's hard You're not alone, you're not aloneSummer in my eyelids, eatin' rice and beans Paintin' Kaia's bedroom, think she wanted green But the weather puts you on my mind Dragonfruit and peaches in the wine Kissin' circles underneath your eyes Of course I know why we lasted two months Could not hold my hand in public Felt their eyes judgin' our love and baying' for blood I could never blame you darlin' Some of these folks wanna make you cry But you gotta trust how you feel insi-i-i-ide And shine, and shi-ine, yeah, yeah, yeah I wish that your parents had been kinder to you They made you hate what you were out of habit Remember when they caught us makin' out after school Your dad said he felt like he'd lost you So I know why we lasted two months Could not hold my hand in public Felt their eyes judgin' our love and baying' for blood I could never blame you darlin' Fallin' asleep Holdin' your puppy in your Prussian blue sheets Never felt luckier Than I do right now, tell me you love me, let me have it Blood on your fleece Grippin' the cup and gettin' sick in the streets Never felt luckier Than I do right now, under the stars you trust in me Blue jewels 'round your neck You cool my distress Loose cherries, hot breath I'm overwhelmed I spun 'round and screamed, "I feel elated when you hold me"Then you got shy and beamed, "I think it's special that you told me"I think you're special 'cause you told me I think you're special 'cause you told me I think you're special 'cause you told me Got the red eye Just to be near, 'cause my head eats me alive You're makin' sure I'm eatin'I call my mother just to tell her that I'm happyCollapsed in sunbeams, stretched out open to beauty however brief or violent I see myself ablaze with joy, sleepy eyed, feeding your cat or slicing artichoke hearts I see myself sitting beside you, elbows touching, hurt and terribly quiet The turquoise in my ring matches the deep blue cramp of everything We're all learning to trust our bodies, making peace with our own distortions You shouldn't be afraid to cry in front of me, I promiseI talk to girls that sing about asphyxiation Until their beer goes flat I talk to girls that bring their switchblades to the function And dye their buzzcuts black Shut your mouth and take your vitamins Bite your nails and sell your Ritalin I feel like the world is on my back Shut your mouth and take your vitamins Bite your nails and sell your Ritalin I feel like the world is on its back I'm just a kid, I Suffocate and slip, I Hate that we're all sick Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm just a kid, I Suffocate and slip, I Hate that we're all sick I'm blowing bubbles in the faces of thugs I'm smoking licorice tobacco for lunch, yeah I'm still denying that I'm anxious as fuck And I'm lacking in trust and I think my art sucks I look inside my head with disgust I would say it to my mates, but they're probably drunk So I listen to funk, I bend to the punch Then pretend that I'm fine when, really, I'm crushed
