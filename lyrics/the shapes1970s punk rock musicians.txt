in red Stained by the blood of the innocent slain He has no regret There's no mercy for the weak of heart They'll be trampled down and torn apart And as ruthless as it all may seem Well, the wild cares not for the weaker beings Pursuing the scent, the stench of fear It leads him to his prey Cold and alone, forever he roams Devouring all in his way There's no mercy for the weak of heart They'll be trampled down and torn apart And as ruthless as it all may seem Well, the wild cares not for the weaker beings And all that he knows is this life of murder Oh, to feed his hunger woes Oh, and he knows that his soul, oh his soul is damned For what God would love, oh such a wicked awful manWell, now I’m not afraid to do the lord's work You say vengeance is his, but Imma do it first I’m gonna handle my business in the name of the law Now if he made you cry, man, I gotta know If he’s not ready to die, he best prepare for it My judgement’s divine, I'll tell you who you can call You can call

back to basics I couldn't remember Just what made me fall for you Searching for others To make me feel all new But everytime I felt that feeling I knew it wasn't what I neededI got vultures circling 'round everywhere I go Those devils in the sky, watching down below I don't let 'em get me mad, I don't let 'em bring me down It ain't the first time them kinda scoundrels been hanging around This

in the cool of the day Called Adam by his name But he refused to answer Because he was naked and ashamed Tell me who's that writin'  John the Revelator Tell me who's that writin'  John the Revelator Who's that writin'  John the Revelator Wrote the book of the seven seals Now Christ had twelve apostles And three he led away He said: "watch with me one hour While I go yonder and pray"Tell me who's that writin'  John the Revelator Tell me who's that writin'  John the Revelator Who's that writin'  John the Revelator Wrote the book of the seven sealsThe big old bear walked from his cave, hungrier than he had ever known Haggard and tough, mangled and gruff, ain't a beast alive would go toe to toe On the wind, he caught the scent of prey  as drool dripped from his mouth Hunger in his mind, gravel in his gut, he turned and he headed south Singing, "Oh no, oh no, oh no, I ain't gon' die""Oh no, oh no, oh no, I ain't gon' die"Smoke rose up ahead as he barreled through those woods There's no turning back now even if he could King of the forest, who could claim his throne When his mighty thunderous roar sends chills to the bone Singing, "Oh no, oh no, oh no, I ain't gon' die""Oh no, oh no, oh no, I ain't gon' die"The hunter froze when he heard the roar come through the trees He set up a trap underneath a pile of leaves He grabbed his gun, backed away from the fire That big damn bear was the heart of his desireOld and crooked bones creek against his weary feet Now he's grown so old, marked by the lines in his face Stubborn old man refusing to change Son of the vicious wolves, he'll be the remainder of his days Oh, woah, mmm And if you listen to the wind You can hear the howl of the man who was raised by wolves Though his body disappear You still know that his soul lingers onOoh, yeah Looking back I know I was walking around in disguise It's a fact I was just a lost soul, I needed a guide And the moment that you came to change my life Oh, you fired up my heart and made me smile'Cause you and I know that I'm a different person, yeah Turn my world around I'm a different person, yeah Turn my world around I'm a different person, yeah Turn my world around I'm a different person, yeah Turn my world around Fears I had All fading away by the minute, and I feel alive You untwisted all of my troubles inside
