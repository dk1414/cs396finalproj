N  E  X  T Naked as sin an army towel covering my belly Some of us weep, some of us howl, knees turn to jelly But next Next I was just a child A hundred like me I followed a naked body A naked body followed me Next Next I was just a child when my innocence was lost In a mobile army whorehouse A gift of the army, free of cost Next!Next!Next!Me, I really would have liked a little bit of tenderness Maybe a word, maybe a smile, maybe some happiness But next Next Oh, it was not so tragic And heaven did not fall But how much at that time I hated being there at all Next Next I still recall the brothel trucks, the flying flags The queer lieutenant slapped our arses Thinking we were fags Next!Next!Next The dawn reached 'cross the pillow Where the face of an angel Lies cradled in a nest of tangled hair And the smile of contentment on your face While you've been sleeping Keeps me going makes, me know just why I'm here And I don't believe you'll ever find The thought will ever cross my mind to leave I'd die from loneliness I need your only-ness A place for my soul to rest Yes, I need your love to make my life beautiful The alarm clock rings at seven And I feel a stir beside me I'm hearing your gentle footsteps on the floor I raise up from my pillow Just in time to catch a small glimpse of a housecoat Swishing through the kitchen door I watch my shaving razor gliding smoothly On the face of a happy man who loves to live at home And the sweetest voice I ever heard is calling me to breakfast I don't know how I made it on my ownPaper sir, paper sir, paper sir The mobs in town And the guns are out And Louie knows what it's all about He's gunning down the cops with machine-gun tops Moving in a black sedan A stickup worth a hundred grand Headline sensation:"A Payroll Grab in the Union Station"Now there's no lights on the Christmas tree mother They're burning Big Louie tonight There's no electricity mother They're burning Big Louie tonight Across the state the bandits fly Victims scream, gangsters die And sirens in the night and armoured cars and dynamite Now Peter is on the mob And the F BI is on the job And now the headlines say:"Louie Bannassas On Trial Today"Now there's no lights on the Christmas tree mother They're burning Big Louie tonight There's no electricity mother They're burning Big Louie tonightI'm walking down the street mindin' my own affair When two policemen grabbed me and I'm unaware They said "Is your name Alexander " and I said "Why, sure"They said "You're the cat that we've been looking for"But I was framed I was framed I never did nothing But now I was, I was framed The cops took me to a little room where the bright light shines There was ten poor souls like me standin' in that line I knew I was the victim of somebody's evil plan When a stool pigeon looked at me an' said"There's your man!"But I was framed, framed I was framed, framed I was framed, framed I never did nothing But I was framed, framed, framed Oh yes, oh yes Then the public prosecutor started prosecutin' me That man wanted to find what was my pedigree He said "Where were you on the third of June 1963 "Then them cats with their rubber hoses started givin' me the third degreeCrying out loud said a face in the crowd Can you hear me talkin'The river was dry that was why I'm on the road and walking A man on a horse with a box on his head He was sayin' to

umbrella cause he Keeps on blowing bubbles Come up and let me analyse you Said the monkey to the weasel And I'll paint your picture on the wall If you can buy the easel And I told my story to the cannibal king Said baby baby shake that thing Once upon a sunshine Before the final bell I told my story to big boy With connections straight from Hell His fiddle was his sweetheart He was her favourite beau And hear me saying was all he was playing Them songs from long ago I told my story to the cannibal king Said baby baby shake that thingIf your body's feelin' bad And it's the only one
