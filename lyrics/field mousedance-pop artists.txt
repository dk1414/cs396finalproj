It didn't start this way, I can assure you All your sweetness drained, you call to say“I can see the future and it looks gray”I’d never want bad things for you Mid-Atlantic stuck in the sprawl I still got a heart of gold I still got a heart I'd never wish bad things for you Isn't it enough just to know I still got a heart of gold I still got a heart Skyline ‘cross the lake, crossing back home On the holiday I kept dreaming of cars crashing, now I still wake up haunted by the sound I’d never wish bad things for you Mid-Atlantic stuck in the sprawl I still got a heart of gold I still got a heart I'd never want bad things for you Isn't it enough just to know I still got a heart of gold I still got a heartWhat does it mean to light a beacon When there aren't any boats in sight To read the words but miss the reason Do you carry all that heavy light That light Are you the only one without them Are you the only one in disguise Are you the only one left now Are you the only one left behind Flotsam in the shallow water Can you walk yourself home at night Or do you even still bother Looking out for all those ships at night Are you the only one without them Are you the only one in disguise Are you the only one left now Are you the only one left behind Today was different 'cause I made it so Today was okay because I left it alone Today was different 'cause I made it so Today was okay because I left it aloneClose calls Caught that train tonight Once and for all we're fine Just you sit tight I'm happy Out in the ether Come up to meet her We'll say it's a joke But you'll never know And that's what you get For loving your regret You give me nothing You give me nothing It's warm out now, the stakes have changed If you let me, I'll still feel the same Oh, you give me nothing I'm happySleep I know you won't let me be Got a smile as a guarantee I know you won't let me sleep Far I know you've come too far I know you are what you are I know you are what you are It gets too close to what you already know To what you already know Wait Are we ever going to meet I feel you creeping out my feet Shadow on the balance beam Stay And take it all away'cause nothing means that much to me But what I'd give to feel so free Read "why'd you go and waste it "Written on a wall in a crowded basement Everything's going down this week It's history Got a photo and pocket litany Back in time you're all so free Back in time you aren't with meIf you believe it’s gold, then it’s gold Any two-bit appraiser will tell you so Alchemical prize for the last of the Western rush She used to say it all the time But years passed and now it’s mine Erasing you was easy Once I figured it out and now That you’re gone completely I am the last monument standing When you wake you will remember everything Running slowly through a dream Half blind and screaming, screaming Where’s he off to with that gun Imagining is no fun, no fun I should have vanished upstate There wasn’t much to come back to anyway Nothing new, it’s always been the same But now it just feels too late Running faster through the scene When you wake you will remember everythingLittle pieces of All that you've made up I take them in my head I make them up instead Push smoke through the air While you live out there In the spaces i used to fill I watched you When you're out of love When you're out of love When you're out of love It would never be us In a warm waking dream I left it all at sea Watched the water carry it Away from me Little highs between the lines Set the good times free You got the part So be happy Be happyIt’s everywhere we go now Bearing all its weight Until it slows us both down Monolith of the day It’s everywhere Look around, what sets this strange scene Pieces of a world where we are nothing Sleepwalk, find myself stuck in someone else’s dream Interrupt and hear the cadence of the silent Sound of everything There was a warm home inside you Where you left the shades drawn, so I wandered in It’s everywhere I go now Through my dreams tonight I didn’t recognize you how I remembered from life It took me three whole years to Look you in the eye And even now I Sleepwalk, watch myself from above Always running to catch up When alone I remember the road when I could like it Calm before the time split Mission Central Station Drew your face from life From life so I could frame itOh ah ah yeah yeah Do do doop dum Do do doop do doop da dum Do do doop dum Do do doop do doop da dum Do do doop do do do Do do doop do doop da dum Do do doop dum Do do doop do doop da dum Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby We were as one, babe For a moment in time And it seemed everlasting That you would always be mine Now you want to be free So I'll let you fly'Cause I know in my heart, babe Our love will never die, no You'll always be a part of me I'm part of you indefinitely Boy, don't you know you can't escape me Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby And we'll linger on Time can't erase a feeling this strong No way you're never gonna shake me Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my babyCounting all different ideas drifting away Past and present, they don't matter, now the future's sorted out Watch her moving in elliptical patterns Think it's not what you say, what you say is way too complicated For a minute, thought I couldn't tell how to fall out It's twenty seconds 'til the last call You're going, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey"Lie down, you know it's easy Like we did it over summer long And I'll be anything you ask and more Going, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey"It's not a miracle we needed And no, I wouldn't let you think so Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it Girlfriend, oh, your girlfriend is drifting away Past and present1855-1901 Watch them built up a material tower Think it's not going to stay anyway, think it's overrated For a minute, thought I couldn't tell how to fall outWhite moon out tonight Four and twenty eyes Do you see me  I live upstairs I wait forever there Elemental and polite My shadow, filled with fire And time spins on and on But meaning is gone The meaning is gone So just make it up
