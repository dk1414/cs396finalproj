Downtown's been caught by the hysteria People scream and shout A generation's on the move When disco spreads like a bacteria Those lonely days are out Welcome the passion of the groove The golden years, the silver tears You wore a tie like Richard Gere I wanna get down, you spin me around I stand on the borderline Crying at the discoteque Crying at the discoteque I saw you crying I saw you crying at the discoteque I saw you crying I saw you crying at the discoteque Tonight's the night at danceteria The joining of the tribe The speakers blasting clear and loud The way you dance is our criteria The D J takes you high Let tears of joy baptise the crowdGuess what I'm gonna do tonight Baby, that's right Guess where I'm gonna go tonight Baby, that's right Come along, just be who you are Come out and play with Alcazar Blame it on the disco Blame it on the lights Ah ah, we're gonna party tonight Blame it on the disco Blame it on the drums Dance till tomorrow comes See my smile, I kiss the sad goodbye With a dance under the neon sky Blame it on the disco Blame it on the drums Dance till tomorrow comesSomebody's filled with hate His faith is all about a certain Too busy thinkin' 'bout the pain To bother checkin' why it's hurtin'So come on, make it right tonight Gotta get in the light Doesn't matter who you are When you're movin' up with Alcazar This is the world we live in And these are the hands we're given Use them and let's start tryin' To make it a place worth livin' in This is the world we live in And these are the hands we're given Use them and let's start tryin'

stars Heaven send an angel;The heaven where you are Shine On Brighten up the sky Tell the world I'm comin'I'll follow you up high;Lost on the ocean, across the raging sea An angel came descending, an angel sent for me Silencing the waters, it kept the night at bay But only moments later, the savior's gone away;Shine On Shine among the stars Heaven send an angel;The heaven where you are Shine On Brighten up the sky Tell the world I'm comin'I'll follow you up high;Late in the evening, the company I keep;I walk the road to nowhere, I put myself to sleep Pray I find a savior, someone to take my hand And only for a moment, I can see the Promised Land;Leave me alone Can't you see I can't stop crying I get down on my knees I'll be begging you please Don't leave me alone Leave me alone Don't leave me alone Leave me alone Don't leave me alone Last night we were celebrating You played truth or dare I came out hallucinating And love was in the air We met down in clubland We had an affair We danced in the spotlight The fire was there You said I'm the only Then walked out of town I beg you please don't turn around Leave me alone Can't you see I can't stop crying I get down on my knees I'll be begging you please Don't leave me alone Leave me alone Can't you see I can't stop crying If you walk out that door I can't stand it no more Don't leave me alone Sitting through this courtroom drama of who did what to whome Stand accused of cold seduction The cameras ready zoom You said there was more That your love was for real You said you'd come back for my heartache to heal I stand on a bridge And I'm ready to fly This time it's my last goodbye Leave me alone Can't you see I can't stop crying I get down on my knees I'll be begging you please Don't leave me alone Leave me alone Can't you see I can't stop crying If you walk out that door I can't stand it no more Don't leave me alone Leave me alone Can't you see I can't stop crying I get down on my knees I'll be begging you please Don't leave me alone Leave me alone We met down in clubland We had an affair We danced in the spotlight The fire was there You said I'm the only Then walked out of town I beg you please don't turn around You said there was more That your love was for real You said you'd come back For my heartache to heal I stand on a bridge And I'm ready to fly This time it's my last goodbye Leave me alone Can't you see I can't stop crying I get down on my knees I'll be begging you please Don't leave me alone Leave me alone Can't you see I can't stop crying If you walk out that door I can't stand it no more Don't leave me aloneGoodbye to you my trusted friend We've known each other Since we were nine or ten Together we've climbed hills and trees Learned of love and A BC Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees Goodbye my friend it's hard to die When all the birds are singing in the sky Now that the spring is in the air Pretty girls are everywhere Think of me and I'll be there We had joy we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the hills that we climbed Were just seasons out of time Goodbye papa please pray for me I was the black sheep of the family You tried to teach me right from wrong Too much wine and too much song Wonder how I got along Goodbye papa it's hard to die When all the birds are singing in the sky Now that the spring is in the air Little children everywhere When you see them I'll be there We had joy we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the wine and the song Like the seasons have all gone We had joy we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the wine and the song Like the seasons have all gone Goodbye Michelle my little one You gave me love And helped me find the sun And every time that I was down You would always come around And get my feet back on the ground Goodbye Michelle it's hard to die When all the birds are singing in the sky Now that the spring is in the air With the flowers everywhere I wish that we could both be there We had joy we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the stars we could reach Were just starfish on the beach We had joy we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the stars we could reach Were just starfish on the beach We had joy we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the wine and the song Like the seasons have all gone All our lives we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the hills that we climbed Were just seasons out
