Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans Way back up in the woods among the evergreens There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood Where lived a country boy named Johnny B  Goode Who never ever learned to read or write so well But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell Go, go Go Johnny go, go Go Johnny go, go Go Johnny go, go Go Johnny go, go Johnny B  Goode He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made People passing by they would stop and say Oh my, but that little country boy could play Go, go Go Johnny go, go Go Johnny go, go Go Johnny go, go Go Johnny go, go Johnny B  GoodeWhen I was a little bitty boy My grandmother bought me a cute little toy Silver bells hangin' on a string She told me it was my ding a ling ling My ding a ling, my ding a ling I want to play with my ding a ling My ding a ling, my ding a ling I wanna play with my ding a ling When mamma took me to Sunday School They tried to teach me the golden rule Every time the choir would sing I'd sit there and play with my ding a ling My ding a ling, my ding a ling I want to play with my ding a ling My ding a ling, my ding a ling I wanna play with my ding a ling When Pa started me to Grammar School I found a place in the vestibule And every time the bell would ring They'd catch me playin' with my ding a lingIt was a teenage wedding And the old folks wished them well You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle And now the young monsieur
