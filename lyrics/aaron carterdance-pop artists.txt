the court, just playing some ball Working on my game I heard the fans screaming, I thought it was for me But then I saw a shadow, it was 12 foot 3 It was Shaquille O'Neal I told him why not, I got some time But when I beat you real bad, try not to cry Yeah, 34 center from the L.A  Lakers I knew I could take him Stared at Shaq, psyche him out I said O'Neal, you're in my house now Start the game the whistle blows Pay attention close 'cause the story goesShe living in this lie with him No more coffee in the morning I'm wide awake while he sleeping in Know that's why you're calling You woke up chasing feelings, healing, trouble dealing Coping with the fact that you're alone Makes you miss my body, touching, kissing, squeezing He don't know you're worth your weight in gold Look at you falling Do you even know what you're falling for Cause I see you falling You traded my heart for some fool's gold Fools Gold Can't think about your nights with him Wearing nothing but the moonlight When you feel your conscience stepping in Move it to my house, what There's something I've got to say You're always with me even though you're far away Talking to you on my cell Just the sound of your voice Makes my heart melt oh, girl Well, it's true I'm all about you I'm all about us No, baby, you never have to question my love And every night there's a new crowd But it's always you, I'm singing
