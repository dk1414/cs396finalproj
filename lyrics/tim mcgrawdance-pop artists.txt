said someday I hope you get the chance To live like you were dyin'He said I was finally the husband That most the time I wasn't And I became a friend a friend would like to have And all the sudden goin' fishing Wasn't such an imposition And I went three times that year I lost my dad Well I finally read the good book And I took a good long hard look at what I'd do If I could do it all again And
