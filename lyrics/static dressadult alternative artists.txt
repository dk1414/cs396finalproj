Hello good morning Say bye to yesterday Where you going, pretty lady With that look on your face I felt your disease Left blind and so weak I raised everyone You owe it to me Let it go, let it go That's all you had to say I'm not one for many words anyway Don't speak unless spoken to The bottle it takes Away the mistakes we made I hold everything You left this to me So you know these dreams I hope you know they don’t float And I’ll be the savior under your waistcoatDeep in the city, where no one sleeps at night Witness callous conversation Balanced on a knife Keep your mouth shut, mouth shut, mouth shut For silence they scream To see the things no man should ever see And we’re both invited, and you’ll barely be missed Taking back to the first night chasing lovers first kiss And you’re thinking of leaving When I'm kicking and screaming Silence repeats itself Size 5’s in the air Lights in the rear view She couldn’t concentrate But these back seats look much more safe I hold all of this to you Like your famous last line We’re slowly drinking Cheap red wine Keep your eyes closed tight Throw it into fifth, give me so much more This is nothing new Came so close to keep thinking Is this nightmare over Feet off the floor Nails through the bed Crying in lay-bys Throw it into fifth and you’ll see that there's Nothing to loseSpinning stops, so pick me up Cotton mouth from drinking Her lips stayed shut With her eyes glued To the back of your head Does this impress you Lies sold as truth I know I'm not wanted here Dead response and cold replies We're sick on bathroom floors Watching our days go by Our days go by Arms are bound to see you get so slim With the dagger drawn, vertical wrist slit When my pain stops, yours begins Convulsing through love locked jaws I know I'm not wanted here Dead response and cold replies We're sick on bathroom floors Watching our days go by Our days go bySir sparks up another As the ash falls down, you crumble to your knees Clench your glass, the rouge décor Come back from begging and broke it more Soul destroyer Crippled wings A crisis almost lost to everything But most of all Did you really need me Were we just a passing phase Like cigarettes in movie scenes It’s too much for me Keep your eyes on me Concrete in ceilings Clothes hang from our broken frame We split our nerves between our words You took this from me Shе never looked thе same But most of all Did you really need me Were we just a passing phase Like cigarettes in movie scenesFix your disease Leave in a cardboard box Syringe induced dreams Help forget all of us Pray under him Crucifix with no meaning Do not resuscitate Appetites have run cold Back and forth, the room starts to swing For when you fall asleep Lips turn to stone Empty handed and alone And alone Appetites have run cold Back and forth, the room starts to swing For when you fall asleep Lips turn to stone Empty handed and alone Before I have to leave Tears gravitate and your cold surface speaks Dying on a payphone Sleeping rough in the car For what I've lost hеre Won't stop falling As I've been overthinking еverything Falling FallingEven the prettiest of people have the ugliest of moments Spent on the stairs alone Bury me in the deepest lake and strap cinder to my feet I'll overturn the tides as you just bury me So once I sink low enough All fibres start to part Let your false words retract themselves And the canvas fix the art Hold your breath for steady aim To use me as a barricade Courtier the child's games Eyes are glazed and filled with shame I think that I moved on too soon Just left here with my thoughts gripped on losing you Dying here with open palms Final thoughts, dead in her arms I think that I moved on too soon Cover up and help me quit The bruise that doesn't show Scratched beneath the surface So much you made a home This bruise won't showJumping out of a second-story window Are you limited to that Living life on the inside You’ve brought a dull blade to a gunfight Coping well, you're coping well And are you doing this all to yourself Coping well, are you coping well Or am I just enough for a cheap night So say the safe word Tell me when to stop and I'll save everything Misplaced and abused Slept in your clothes again Falling apart, falling apart for this Intoxicate me There's no love left in this house Tell me how to love Tell me how to live These bedsheets move on their own With a sorry look to your face Torn up misused lipstick stained Secret space just left unseen Share with another Castaway dream Secrets lied half untold Try to ask if I'm okayDrowning Red lights catch breath All mistakes wiped away reckless sentiments Cemeteries, stability Rope burn left for company Once buried, you can't leave him Six feet's just the start for me Just another hit to the chest I'll just lay here Played out our movie like a b-side To only feast on cowards hearts that couldn't hide Analyze every scratch, word once said Soft-spoken when I'm played in defense Get the photographs of the evidence Evicted scenes of mine Save yourself before the end tonight Bodies beneath, the ground breaking I retrace the steps And I'll just lay here Take a seat On this cold metal chair Pale blue taste that she's met many times Chalk choking bitter sweet Met with a thousand unheard cries Yet you keep yourself "so clean"Medicine to help mend, to help you move, to help your aches Expelled the problems that would slowly move us away Hands, the hair, the aftershock to help re-sculpt, reshape the lie A heart protеcted in glass A frozen kiss, fragile goodbyе Love letters buried deep in ashtrays Even dilated, she addresses him the same Clenching final moments Stealing the air you breathe Caught on a double edge standard Inhaled your last mistake Clenching final moments every breath Claimed as an accident Inhaled your last mistake Last mistake Blind blisters on my feral tongue Once the secret's contorted You must try to bury themCheck the vital signs Use it all You’ve become salvageable How much you’ve changed Oh, how we’ve grown apart Just let me leave Find closed eyes As an entry Slowly slip into your sun-kissed dream I doth say this and pray for thee I wonder and remain leaving A choice seems so fit Adaptive taste We are caught in the same way Same person, different face Sewn together with stitches unfit A cast made for molding Remains still split
