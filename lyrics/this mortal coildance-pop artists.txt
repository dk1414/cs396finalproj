On the floating shipless oceans I did all my best to smile Till your singing eyes and fingers Drew me loving to your isle And you sang, "Sail to me Sail to me; let me enfold you Here I am, here I am Waiting to hold you"Did I dream you dreamed about me Were you here when I was full-sail Now my foolish boat is leaning Broken lovelorn on your rocks For you sing, "Touch me not Touch me not; come back tomorrow Oh, my heart—oh, my heart Shies from the sorrow"I'm as puzzled as a newborn child I'm as riddled as the tide Should I stand amid the breakers Or should I lie with death, my bride I first saw you You had on blue jeans Your eyes couldn't hide anything I saw you breathing And I saw you staring out in space I next saw you It was at a party Thought you was uncool Oh so flirty I came against You didn't say excuse Knew what I was doing We looked very fine As we were leaving That Saint Joan Doing a cool, cool jerk Oh, I want you Oh, I want you Like a kangarooThe kettle's on, the sun has gone, another day She offers me Tibetan tea on a flower tray She's at the door, she wants to score, she really needs to say:"I loved you a long time ago, you know Where the winds of forget-me-nots blow, oh But I just couldn't let myself go Not knowing what on Earth there was to know But I wish that I had 'cause I'm feeling so sad And that I never had one of your children"From across the room, inside a tomb, a chance is waxed and waned The night is young, why are we so hung up in each other's chains I must take her, and I must make her, while the dove domains And feel the juice run as she flies Run my wings under her thighs As the flames of eternity rise To lick us with the firstborn, lash of dawn Oh really my dear, I can't see what we fear Sat here with ourselves, in-between us here We meet at the door, we can't say more than just another day And without a sound, I turn around and I walk awaySixteen days no bread and water Sixteen days no light and day Sixteen days without liquid on my stomach Sixteen days without sun on my back Sixteen days without ideas in my head Sixteen days with writing on my hands Ah...The pressure's on, no time to lose The pressure's on, no time to lose The pressure's on, no time to lose The pressure's on, no time to lose Inspiring dreams, all shattered and blown away Gathering dust, the band played on again Personal reasons are problems in the way Waking up with just enough time to spare Lalala.. Fond affections are never said They're only sung in songs I never was naive enough to know when I was wrong There's no light at the end of it all Let's all sit down and cry There's no light at the beginning Let's all sit down and cry Now it's time to say goodbye Now it's being forced upon you It's just that person by your side remaining distant Now the winter's growing close The days are getting older I can tell by your face That your heart is getting colder There's no light at the end of it all Let's all sit down and cry There's no light at the beginning Let's all sit down and cryYour eyes are almost dead Can't get out of bed And you can't sleep You're sitting down to dress And you're a mess You look in the mirror You look in your eyes Say you realize Everybody goes, leaving those who fall behind Everybody goes as far as they can, they don't just care They stood on the stairs Laughing at your errors Your mother's dead She said, "Don't be afraid"Your mother's dead You're on your own She's in her bed Everybody goes, leaving those who fall behind Everybody goes as far as they can, they don't just care You're a wasted face A sad-eyed lie You're a holocaustIt may be as you say, I'll admit But you don't sound convinced Between the surface you and the surface me You didn't touch me It may be as well that I didn't see the point You didn't touch me You didn't touch me You didn't touch me You didn't touch me I suppose it's just hollow No idea, no spark When I thought that in order to survive You need to touch me All of the me's It may be as well that I didn't see the point You didn't touch me You didn't touch me You didn't touch me You didn't touch me You didn't touch me You didn't touch me You didn't touch me You didn't touch meI'm living but I'm feeling numb Can see it in my stare I wear a mask so falsely now And I don't know who I am This void, the world's inside of me And they won't take me away I've noticed in other eyes Time's closing in But when the thunder breaks, it breaks for you and me Tarantula, tarantula, tarantula, tarantula The future's looking rather grim Strange black tide Decisions lie with stupid men Along with my life They're choking and they're hyping me Expecting me to fall But only if I'm threatened Will the tables turn But when the thunder breaks, it breaks for you and me Tarantula, tarantula, tarantula, tarantulaJust like the sun over the mountain tops You know I'll always come again You know I love to spend my morning times Like sunlight dancing on your skin I've never gone so wrong as for telling lies to you What you've seen is what I've been There is nothing I could hide from you You see me better than I can Out on the road that lies before me now There are some turns where I will spin I only hope that you can hold me now Till I can gain control again Like a lighthouse you must stand alone Landmark the sailor's journeys end No matter what seas I have been sailing on I'll always roll this way again Out on the road that lies before me now There are some turns where I will spin I only hope that you can hold me now Till I can gain control againOn the floating shipless oceans I did all my best to smile Till your singing eyes and fingers Drew me loving to your isle And you sang, "Sail to me Sail to me; let me enfold you Here I am, here I am Waiting to hold you"Did I dream you dreamed about me Were you here when I was full-sail Now my foolish boat is leaning Broken lovelorn on your rocks For you sing, "Touch me not Touch me not; come back tomorrow Oh, my heart—oh, my heart Shies from the sorrow"I'm as puzzled as a newborn child I'm as riddled as the tide Should I stand amid the breakers Or should I lie with death, my bride
