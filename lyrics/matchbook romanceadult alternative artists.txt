Girl, what's come between you and me  Look right through me I won't let it go, I can't help this feeling anymore I will go anywhere, maybe you'll see Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh, ah...We are, we are the shaken We are the monsters  underneath your bed Yeah, believe what you read We are, we are mistaken We are the voices  inside your head Yeah, believe what you see Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...It came as no surprise, you bring me back to life Believe me, "You bleed for me, I'll bleed for you"I caught you walking through walls, drowned with applause From the world that makes me crazy Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh, ah.. My eyes burn from these tears You'd think I'd learn over these years Good things won't last forever So what the hell am I supposed to do You only wanted the things I couldn't give to you And you had it all anyway So take, take everything and leave me scrambling Reaching for something that wasn't there in the first place So take, take everything and leave me scrambling Reaching for something that wasn't there in the first place Tell me I'm wrong when I say I can't expect you to spend forever with me I live for that single moment I take back everything I've said You wore those words on your lips As if they meant anything anyway Sometimes I feel I could drop off the face of the earth It seems I do more harm than good And I don't know if it's worth me losing sleep over thisWe drive tonight And you are by my side We're talking about our lives Like we've known each other forever The time flies by With the sound of your voice It's close to paradise With the end surely near And if I could only stop the car And hold onto you And never let go I'll never let go As we round the corner To your house You turned to me and said"I'll be going through withdrawal of you For this one night we have spent"And I want to speak these words But I guess I'll just bite my tongue And accept "someday, somehow"As the words that we'll hang from And I I don't want to speak these words'Cause I I don't want to make things any worse And I I don't want to speak these words'Cause I I don't want to make things any worseWhat would you say if I asked you not to go To forget everyone, forget everything and start over with me Would you take my hand and never let me go Promise me you'll never let me go And now the stars aren't out tonight But neither are we to look up at them Why does hello feel like goodbye These memories can't replace These wishes I wished and dreams I chased Take this broken heart and make it right I feel like I've lost everything when you're gone Left remembering what it's like to have you here with me I thought you should know You're not making this easy I never thought I'd be the one to say Please don't, well please don't leave me I feel like I've lost everything when you're gone Left remembering what it's like to have you here with me I thought you should know You're not making this easyA subdued silence undisturbed by the sound of her breath So carefully, brush her hair back from her eyes In steady sequence, one by one She slips away So close your eyes and sleep to dream I'm by your side No words to speak We'll set our course and make it through No matter how far I go my heart remains with you And I'm not sure what I'm looking for But it's clear to see the purpose of my existence Is laying here in front of me So close your eyes and sleep to dream I'm by your side No words to speak We'll set our course and make it through No matter how far I go And if all else fails you can look up at the sky Because it's the same one that shines above you and I And if all else fails you can close your eyes And I'll be right beside you I'll be the one by your sideThe hand of my clock strikes two In times when I got the best of you We made promises we couldn't keep And every night we couldn't sleep I didn't know why, but didn't ask questions Because it was the first time in my life Yeah, the first time in my life Where I did something right I set myself up for the greatest fall of all time I set myself up for the greatest fall of all time You pick me apart While I search for witty things to say "You'll never amount to anything anyway"And think that I'm impressed with your one night stands And your contagious kiss I'm trying to get this right Yeah, cause I'm ridiculous like that I set myself up for the greatest fall of all time I set myself up for the greatest fall of all time I'll keep this as A constant reminder Of the nights I spent holding onto her And rest assured I'm moving on I miss you less, with each day you're gone Speak to me Tell me something so typical A lullaby or something miserable That will keep me up at night Cross out my eyes I know you planned it You know i love you And i can't stand it We just lost control Lie to me Give me something worth living for Tell me a reason worth fighting for Give me anything, anything to keep me breathing Lie to me Give me something worth living for Tell me a reason worth fighting for Give me anything, anything to keep me breathing Go lie to me Tell me stories so beautiful An epic of something so terrible That it makes me weepIt's so simple and complicated The way you can crush me No matter how much this hurts, this is through I get as far as your door before i get caught I make up excuses just to touch you and I can't stop, I can't stop So are we playing for keeps These days begin and they don't end for weeks Leave me left out of anything to do with you Excuse me while I fall apart Don't flatter yourself sweetheart Let me take the wheel and I'll crash this car Do you have to make this so hard You're so good at pretending everything is alright You're as welcome as cancer, but my door is always unlocked So are we playing for keeps These days begin and they don't end for weeks Leave me left out of anything to do with you Excuse me while I fall apart Don't flatter yourself sweetheart Let me take the wheel and I'll crash this car Do you have to make this so hard You're so good You're so good You're so good You're so goodShallow it seems but I need you here From me to you, I know I can’t feel a thing Oh, sing me to sleep I won't fight it when you leave Oh, I wish you were here I wish you were here I wish you were here, oh...Desperate it seems but I can’t breathe Are you real Are you real I can’t feel a thing And this machine won’t stop Be here when I wake Sing me to sleep I won't fight it when you leave Sing me to sleep I won't fight it…Oh, I wish you were here I wish you were here I wish you were here, oh..
