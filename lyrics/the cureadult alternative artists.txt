Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am home again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am young again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am fun again However far away I will always love you However long I stay I will always love you Whatever words I say I will always love you I will always love you"Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick The one that makes me scream", she said"The one that makes me laugh", she said And threw her arms around my neck"Show me how you do it, and I promise you I promise that I'll run away with you I'll run away with you"Spinning on that dizzy edge Kissed her face and kissed her head Dreamed of all the different ways I had to make her glow"Why are you so far away ", she said"Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you That I'm in love with you "You, soft and only You, lost and lonely You, strange as angels Dancing in the deepest oceans Twisting in the water You're just like a dream You're just like a dreamI don't care if Monday's blue Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too Thursday, I don't care about you It's Friday, I'm in love Monday, you can fall apart Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart Oh, Thursday doesn't even start It's Friday, I'm in love Saturday, wait And Sunday always comes too late But Friday, never hesitate I don't care if Monday's black Tuesday, Wednesday, heart attack Thursday, never looking back It's Friday, I'm in love Monday, you can hold your head Tuesday, Wednesday, stay in bed Or Thursday, watch the walls instead It's Friday, I'm in loveI would say I'm sorry If I thought that it would change your mind But I know that this time I have said too much, been too unkind I tried to laugh about it Cover it all up with lies I tried to laugh about it Hiding the tears in my eyes'Cause boys don't cry Boys don't cry I would break down at your feet And beg forgiveness, plead with you But I know that it's too late And now there's nothing I can do So I try to laugh about it Cover it all up with lies I try to laugh about it Hiding the tears in my eyes'Cause boys don't cry Boys don't cryI've been looking so long at these pictures of you That I almost believe that they're real I've been living so long with my pictures of you That I almost believe that the pictures are all I can feel Remembering you standing quiet in the rain As I ran to your heart to be near And we kissed as the sky fell in, holding you close How I always held close in your fear Remembering you running soft through the night You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow And screamed at the make-believe, screamed at the sky And you finally found all your courage to let it all go Remembering you fallen into my arms Crying for the death of your heart You were stone white, so delicate, lost in the cold You were always so lost in the darkI spy with the corner of my little eye Something beginning with "S"On candy-stripe legs the spiderman comes Softly through the shadow of the evening sun Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead Looking for the victim shivering in bed Searching out fear in the gathering gloom And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room And there is nothing I can do when I realise with fright That the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight Quietly he laughs and shaking his head Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed And softer than shadow and quicker than flies His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light The spiderman is having you for dinner tonight And I feel like I'm being eaten By a thousand million shivering, furry holes And I know that in the morning I will wake up in the shivering cold And the spiderman is always hungryOh, I miss the kiss of treachery The shameless kiss of vanity The soft and the black and the velvety Up tight against the side of me And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed And run in thickening streams of greed As bit by bit it starts the need To just let go my party piece I miss the kiss of treachery The aching kiss before I feed The stench of a love for a younger meat And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep The holding up on bended knees The addiction of duplicities As bit by bit it starts the need To just let go my party piece But I never said I would stay to the end So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy Screaming me over and over and over I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery Songs about happiness murmured in dreams When we both of us knew how the ending would beI've waited hours for this, I've made myself so sick I wish I'd stayed asleep today I never thought this day would end I never thought tonight could ever be this close to me Just try to see in the dark, just try to make it work To feel the fear before you're here I make the shapes come much too close I pull my eyes out, hold my breath and wait until I shake But if I had your faith Then I could make it safe and clean Oh, if only I was sure That my head on the door was a dream I've waited hours for this, I've made myself so sick I wish I'd stayed asleep today I never thought this day would end I never thought tonight could ever be this close to me But if I had your faith Then I could make it safe and clean Oh, if only I was sure That my head on the door was a dreamWhenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am home again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am young again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am fun again However far away I will always love you However long I stay I will always love you Whatever words I say I will always love you I will always love you"Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick The one that makes me scream", she said"The one that makes me laugh", she said And threw her arms around my neck"Show me how you do it, and I promise you I promise that I'll run away with you I'll run away with you"Spinning on that dizzy edge Kissed her face and kissed her head
