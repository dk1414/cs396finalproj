Time can never mend The careless whispers Of a good friend To the heart and mind Ignorance is kind There's no comfort in the truth Pain is all you'll find Should've known better, yeah I feel so unsure As I take your hand And lead you to the dance floor As the music dies Something in your eyes Calls to mind a silver screen And all its sad goodbyes I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet have got no rhythm Though it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool Should've known better than to cheat a friend And waste a chance that I've been given So I'm never gonna dance again The way I danced with you, ohI won't let you down I will not give you up Gotta have some faith in the sound It's the one good thing that I've got I won't let you down So please don't give me up Because I would really, really love to stick around Oh yeah Heaven knows I was just a young boy Didn't know what I wanted to be I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy And I guess it was enough for me To win the race, a prettier face Brand new clothes and a big fat place On your rock and roll T V But today the way I play the game is not the same, no way Think I'm gonna get me some happy I think there's something you should know I think it's time I told you so There's something deep inside of me There's someone else I've got to be Take back your picture in a frame Take back your singing in the rain I just hope you understand Sometimes the clothes do not make the manWell, I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body I know not everybody has got a body like you But I gotta think twice before I give my heart away And I know all the games you play because I played them too Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion Time to pick my heart up off the floor Oh, when that love comes down without devotion Well it takes a strong man, baby But I'm showin' you the door'Cause I gotta' have faith I gotta have faith Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith I got to have faith, faith, faith Baby, I know you're askin' me to stay Say, "Please, please, please don't go away"You say I'm givin' you the blues Maybe  you mean every word you say Can't help but think of yesterday And another who tied me down to loverboy rulesThat's all I wanted Something special, someone sacred in your eyes For just one moment To be bold and naked at your side Sometimes I think that you'll never understand me Maybe this time is forever, say it can be, whoa That's all you wanted Somethin' special, someone sacred in your life Just for one moment, to be warm and naked at my side Sometimes I think that you'll never understand me But somethin' tells me together, we'd be happy, whoa baby I will be your father figure Put your tiny hand in mine I will be your preacher teacher Anything you have in mind I will be your father figure I have had enough of crime I will be the one who loves you'Til the end of timeI've had enough of danger And people on the streets I'm lookin' out for angels Just tryin' to find some peace Now I think it's time That you let me know So if you love me, say you love me But if you don't, just let me go'Cause teacher, there are things That I don't wanna learn And the last one I had Made me cry So I don't wanna learn to hold you, touch you Think that you're mine Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye When you were just a stranger And I was at your feet I didn't feel the danger Now I feel the heat That look in your eyes Tellin' me "No"So you think that you love me and know that you need me I wrote the song, I know it's wrong, just let me goAs around the sun the earth knows she's revolving And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May Just as hate knows love's the cure You can rest your mind assured That I'll be loving you always As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow But in passing we'll grow older every day Just as all is born is new You know what I say is true That I'll be loving you always Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky Until the ocean covers every mountain high Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four Until the day that is the day that I'm no more Did you know that true love asks for nothing Her acceptance is the way we pay Did you know that life has given love a guarantee To last through forever , another dayI can't light no more of your darkness All my pictures seem to fade to black and white I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me Frozen here on the ladder of my life It's much too late to save myself from fallin'I took a chance and changed your way of life But you misread my meanin' when I met you Closed the door and left me blinded by the light Don't let the sun go down on me, yeah Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, oh But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me Ladies and gentlemen, Mr  Elton John I can't find, oh, the right romantic line But see me once and see the way I feel Don't discard me Just because you think I mean you harm But these cuts I have They need love To help them heal, ohKindness in your eyes I guess you heard me cry You smiled at me like Jesus to a child I'm blessed I know Heaven sent and heaven stole You smiled at me like Jesus to a child And what have I learned from all this pain I thought I never feel the same about anyone or anything again But now I know When you find a love When you know that it exists Then the lover that you miss Will come to you on those cold, cold nights When you've been loved When you know it holds such bliss Then the lover that you kissed Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight Sadness in my eyes No one guessed and no one tried You smiled at me like Jesus to a child Loveless and cold With your last breath you saved my soul You smiled at me like Jesus to a child And what have I learned from all these tears I've waited for you all those years Then just when it began he took your love away But I still sayYou are far When I could have been your star You listened to people Who scared you to death and from my heart Strange that you were strong enough To even make a start But you'll never find peace of mind'Til you listen to your heart People You can never change the way they feel Better let them do just what they will For they will If you let them steal your heart from you People Will always make a lover feel a fool But you knew I loved you We could have shown them all We should have seen love through Fooled me with the tears in your eyes Covered me with kisses and lies So goodbye But please don't take my heartIn the past there were arguments for and against casual sex  Then it became a question of morality  These days it can be a question of life or death  It's as simple as that  And this song is not about casual sex There's things that you guess And a'things a'that you know There's boys you can trust And a'girls that you don't There's little things you hide And little things that you show Sometimes you think you're gonna get it But you don't and that's just the way it goes I swear I won't tease you Won't tell you no lies Don't need no Bible Just look in my eyes I've a'waited so long baby Now that we're friends Every man's got his patience And here's where mine ends I want your sex I want your love I want your sex I want your...sex
