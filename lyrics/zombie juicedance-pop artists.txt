Love is showin’ up but love is slowin’ up I mean, I open up, I mean, my heart is stuck Sabotage everything like I don’t give a fuck Like I don’t know whassup, like if we was together It’d probably be forever, might probably be like never And I don’t know what’s good for me Love is like a mystery How you let him treat you like you ain’t worth it Put his hands on you, you ain’t deservе it Some years passed, lеt no nigga treat you like you ain’t bad Like you couldn’t move a room with your sexy ass Like we don't fuck around with your messy ass And he be cheatin' on you, so I don't feel that bad He know your addy, every night he see where you at I know it's wrong, but it's still us I hit you when I'm back off tour if it's no rush I know we need trust I know you want me, but do you really need us You need time to get back to what you really love To being in a space with no one to judge I know this life is tough, lost so many close to you Still find time to smile, rejoice when I'm close to you And I just want the best for you, even if I ain't for you You know what I say, everyday's a new day Don’t bring the negativity from yesterday to today We're blessed to see the sunrise and the smile on our face I always tell my son I love 'em, gotta cherish today I tell him "You ain’t gotta look too far, it's inside of you"I know life is an obstacle, I know this just ain't comfortable I love you, fuck who you are, you ain't gotta hide the truth Know your family love you, you know that you ain't gotta choose I know one day, you gon' be everything you wanted Before the stars fall, before the еarth plummet Gotta put yourself first sometimеs, nothin' above it Make choices with your heart first, make sure you love it then Time, it falls like rain The streets I know, look all so strange Time , I’m on my way Don’t leave the lights on, I'm miles away And I search the Heavens for a sign Of light , light I don't fear nothin', the universe love me Bittersweet though, sometimes it gets ugly Look for love in women, ain’t had my mom to get it Come with relations, no regrets, just wish we had more patience To connect, just reflect, adolescence and such Still the blessings, and the lessons enough I tried to love you, but the love ain't enough So when you gone, will you call When there's no one to trust, call on yourself, fill the void Just invest in yourself, take heed, block the noise Nothin' lasts forever, indeed, but we got choice From 1444 to 1655, just know I'm proud of you So when you hear my voice, I'll be—Keep the E in it, Chevys on—Smoking weed in it Girl, don't post me in your pictures High as my aspirations, clean as my gold Daytons The reason she can stop waiting to exhale I’m smoking well, breathin' clouds, castin' spells Voodoo that I do Don’t leave me 'round your boo Sleepless in Seattle I'm up, I'm rolling fat ones Grazin' on grass like cattle while coyotes lurk in the shadows Usual suspects arrived in matching Corvettes with double barrels Smokin' aces, take ten paces Draw your weapon and pray to God you make it In other words, shoot your shot at all costs, I guess that's what I'm saying He got game, but not like mе, watch how I play it Menace I I Society
