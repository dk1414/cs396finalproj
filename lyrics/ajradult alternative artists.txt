I get up, I get down And I'm jumpin' around And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now Been a hell of a ride But I'm thinking it's time to grow Bang  Bang  Bang!So I got an apartment across from the park Put quinoa in my fridge Still, I'm not feeling grown Been a hell of a ride But I'm thinking it's time to go Bang  Bang  Bang  So put your best face on everybody Pretend you know this song everybody Come hang Let's go out with a bang!Bang  Bang  Bang!I'm way too young to lie here forever I'm way too old to try so whatever Come hang Let's go out with a bang Bang  Bang  Bang "No thank you" is what I should've said I should be in bed But temptations of trouble on my tongue Troubles yet to come One sip, bad for me One hit, bad for me One kiss, bad for me But I give in so easily And "no thank you" is how it should've gone I should stay strong But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that I'm weak, and what's wrong with that Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that I'm weak Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for thatHello, hello I'm not where I'm supposed to be I hope that you're missin' me'Cause it makes me feel young Hello, hello Last time that I saw your face Was recess in second grade And it made me feel young Won't you help me sober up Growin' up, it made me numb And I wanna feel somethin' again Won't you help me sober up All the big kids, they got drunk And I want to feel somethin' again Won't you help me feel somethin' again How's it go again "Goodbye, goodbye"I said to my best-est buds We said that we'd keep in touch And we did our best All my new friends We smile at party time But soon we forget to smile At anything elseMy grandpa fought in World War I IHe was such a noble dude I can't even finish school Missed my mom and left too soon His dad was a fireman Who fought fires so violent I think I bored my therapist While playing him my violin That's so insane That's such a shame Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand But I can't help myself from feeling bad I kinda feel like two things can be sad The world's smallest violin Really needs an audience So if I do not find somebody soon I'll blow up into smithereens And spew my tiny symphony Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, youUsed to keep it cool Used to be a fool All about the bounce in my step Watch it on the news Whatcha gonna do I could hit refresh and forget Used to keep it cool Should I keep it light Stay out of the fight No one’s gonna listen to me If I write a song Preaching what is wrong Will they let me sing on T V Should I keep it light Is that right Way up way up we go Been up and down that road Way up way up, oh no We gon’ burn the whole house down Watch me stand in the line You’re only serving lies You’ve got something to hide We gon’ burn the whole house down We gon’ burn the whole house downI should move'Cause New York is getting muddy out There's L ABut it's always kinda sunny out And I don't wanna hurt no more So I set my bar real low I'm a-okay, I'm a-okay You say it but you just don't mean it You're so insane, you're so insane Shut up and just enjoy this feeling Don't you love it  Don't you love it No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad Don't you love it  Don't you love it No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad But I'm way less sad But I'm way less sad I wake up And I'm not so mad at Twitter now Living sucks But it's sucking just a little now And I don't wanna cry no more So I set my bar real lowI had my first crush in season two She passed me notes and filled our hands with glue And in my corduroys, we'd walk to school I sat and crossed my legs like Jim would do She moved away, I was on season three It hit my heart so hard, I'd hardly speak But I could find some peace and privacy A paper company to sit with me Who are we to wonder where we're going Who am I to tell me who I am Let's take it back and take in every moment Who am I to tell me who I am I turned down Jameson when I was twelve I spent that Friday night with Steve Carell The one where Dwight became the head of sales My eighth-grade graduation wished me well I lost my grandpa during season six I watched my mom, she cried and held her kids My mind was broken up, I couldn't think So I just hugged her the way Michael didRemember when we all got drunk I ended up with two broke thumbs Oh my God, I felt so dumb, lucky me I wrote a song that no one knows I played a show and no one showed Oh my God, I felt so alone, lucky me When all is going wrong and you're scared as hell What you gonna do  Who you gonna tell Maybe a hundred bad days made a hundred good stories A hundred good stories make me
