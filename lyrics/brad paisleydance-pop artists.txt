She put him out Like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette She broke his heart He spent his whole life tryin' to forget We watched him drink his pain away A little at a time But he never could get drunk enough To get her off his mind Until the night He put that bottle to his head And pulled the trigger And finally drank away her memory Life is short, but this time it was bigger Than the strength he had to get up off his knees We found him with his face down in the pillow With a note that said, "I'll love her 'til I die"And when we buried him beneath the willow The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laaTo the man that waited on me at the Starbucks down on Main I hope you understand When I put on that T-shirt, the only thing I meant to say Is I'm a Skynyrd fan The red flag on my chest somehow is Like the elephant in the corner of the south And I just walked him right in the room Just a proud rebel son with an ol' can of worms Lookin' like I got a lot to learn, but from my point of view I'm just a white man coming to you from the Southland Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done And it ain't like you and me can re-write history Our generation didn't start this nation We're still picking up the pieces, walking on eggshells, fighting over yesterday And caught between Southern pride and Southern blame They called it Reconstruction, fixed the buildings, dried some tears We're still siftin' through the rubble after a hundred-fifty years I try to put myself in your shoes and that's a good place to begin But it ain't like I can walk a mile in someone else's skinUsing a fake I D at a college bar Getting caught with a girl in the backseat of a car Running out on the field for the senior game wearing number 17 There's a last time for everything Like a George Strait cassette in a Pontiac Or telling Supercuts, "Let's leave it long in the back"Wearing a tux in a high school gym And she's wearing your class ring There's a last time for everything Last call, last chance Last song, last dance Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be Hold me baby, give me a kiss Like tonight is all there is'Cause there's a last time for everything Throwing the ball with the first dog you ever had Spending all day on the lake with your grandad Watching Glenn Frey sing "Already Gone" at the Forum in L AThere's a last time for everythingIf she was a drink She'd be a single-barrelled Bourbon on ice Smooth with a kick A chill and a burn all at the same time She's Sunday drive meets High speed chase She ain't just a song She's the whole mixtape She's so complicated That's the way God made her Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane And she destroys me in that t-shirt And I love her so much it hurts I never meant to fall like this She don't just rain she pours That girl right there's the perfect storm I know how to make her laugh Or blush, or mad at me But that's okay there ain't no one more beautiful angryWhen you see a deer, you see Bambi And I see antlers up on the wall When you see a lake, you think picnics And I see a largemouth up under that log You're probably thinkin' that you're gonna change me In some ways, well, maybe you might Scrub me down, dress me up, oh, but no matter what Remember I'm still a guy When you see a priceless French paintin'I see a drunk, naked girl You think that ridin' a wild bull sounds crazy And I'd like to give it a whirl Well, love makes a man do some things he ain't proud of And in a weak moment, I might Walk your sissy dog, hold your purse at the mall But remember I'm still a guy And I'll pour out my heart, hold your hand in the car Write a love song that makes you cry Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground'Cause he copped a feel as you walked byShe's a yellow pair of running shoes A holey pair of jeans She looks great in cheap sunglasses She looks great in anything She's I want a piece of chocolate Take me to a movie She's I can't find a thing to wear Now and then she's moody She's a Saturn with a sunroof With her brown hair a-blowing She's a soft place to land And a good feeling knowing She's a warm conversation That I wouldn't miss for nothing She's a fighter when she's mad And she's a lover when she's loving And she's everything I ever wanted And everything I need I talk about her, I go on and on and on Cause she's everything to meWell I love her But I love to fish I spend all day out on this lake And hell is all I catch Today she met me at the door Said I would have to choose If I hit that fishing hole today She'd be packing all her things And she'd be gone by noon Well, I'm gonna miss her When I get home But right now I'm on this lakeshore And I'm sitting in the sun I'm sure it'll hit me When I walk through that door tonight Yeah, I'm going miss her Oh, look there, I've got a bite!Now there's a chance that if I hurry I could beg her to stay But that water's right And the weather's perfect No telling what I might catch todayI remember trying not to stare The night that I first met you You had me mesmerized And three weeks later In the front porch light Taking 45 minutes to kiss goodnight I hadn't told you yet But I thought I loved you then And now you're my whole life Now you're my whole world I just can't believe The way I feel about you girl Like a river meets the sea Stronger than itâ€™s ever been We've come so far since that day And I thought I loved you then And I remember taking you back To right where I first met you You were so surprised There were people around But I didn't care I got down on one knee right there And once again I thought I loved you thenWhen I'm sitting in traffic some afternoon Or bored to death in some waiting room I'm gonna close my eyes and picture you Today You keep brushing that hair back out of your eyes It just keeps falling and so do I Well I'm feeling like the luckiest man alive Today I don't know about tomorrow But right now the whole world feels right And the memory of a day like today Could get you through the rest of your life I know it won't always be like this Life could change as quick as a kiss It's not over yet and I already miss Today I don't know about tomorrow But right now the whole world is right And the memory of a day like today Could get you through the rest of your lifeIf I could write a letter to me And send it back in time to myself at seventeen First, I'd prove it's me by sayin' look under your bed There's a Skoal can and a Playboy no one else would know you hid And then I'd say I know it's tough When you break up after seven months And yeah, I know you really liked her and it just don't seem fair But all I can say is pain like that is fast and it's rare And, oh, you got so much goin' for you, goin' right But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night She wasn't right for you and still you feel like there's a knife Stickin' out of your back and you're wonderin' if you'll survive But you'll make it through this and you'll see You're still around to write this letter to me At the stop sign at Tomlinson and Eighth Always stop completely, well, don't just tap your brakes And when you get a date with Bridgett, make sure the tank is full On second thought, forget it, that one turns out kinda cool Each and every time you have a fight Just assume you're wrong and Dad is right
