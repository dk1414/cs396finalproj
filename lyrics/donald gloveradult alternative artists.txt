 & Troy ]What if you were a Jehovah's Witness That was merely pretending to be into Christmas Gathering clues and blending in To take down the holidays from within You mean like a spy, investigating Making it seem like I'm celebrating When actually I'm infiltrating Santa's operation  ]Going deep cover past enemy lines Making everybody think I'm on the Christmas side Rockin' warm sweaters, hangin' big ass lights If the fat man could see me, yo, it's gotta look right I'll watch all the T V specials that I never could I'll even cry during the sad ones like James Bond would And when the big night comes, it's time to set the bait Cold milk, hot cookies, decorative plates!And he'll come down the chimney and it will be just him and me But he won't know we're enemies, 'cause I'll play sincere Bring a trap, like that, hug him tight, get on his lap And tell him he can come back every year'Cause I am Jehovah's most secret witness So I might have to dedicate my life to Christmas And act just like I love it 'til the day I dieI can see what's happening And they don't have a clue They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line Our trio's down to two The sweet caress of twilight There's magic everywhere And with all this romantic atmosphere Disaster's in the air Can you feel the love tonight The peace the evening brings The world, for once, in perfect harmony With all its living things So many things to tell her But how to make her see The truth about my past  Impossible She'd turn away from me He's holding back, he's hiding But what, I can't decide Why won't he be the king I know he is The king I see inside Kingdom Animalia, Phylum Chordata The Class is Mammalia,'cause boobies, we got 'em Order is Primate, Family Hominidae The genus is Homo, but you know you're into me'Cause I am in the species known as Sapien Dogs used to eat me, but now they bring the paper in It's going to take a lot to get me away from you There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do I bless the rains down in Africa I bless the rains down in Africa I bless the rains down in AfricaThe king's time as ruler rises and falls like the Sun One  day, Simba, the Sun will set on my time here and will rise with you as the new king Simba I'm here, mother  I'm homeSomewhere out there Beneath the pale moonlight Someone's thinking of me And loving me tonight Somewhere out there Someone's saying a prayer That we'll find one another In that big somewhere out there And even though I know how very far apart we are It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby It helps to think we're sleeping underneath that same big sky Somewhere out there If love can see us through Then we'll be together Somewhere out there Out where dreams come trueGive me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart I can give you more than oneHey, guys So cool Thank you guys so much for coming, this is awesome This is so great How many of you guys know me from my show, "Community"?Great Just want to let you guys know This is gonna be nothing like that This is gonna be a lot grosser I feel bad--I feel bad for a lot of people who come to the show Like, people bring their kids and stuff like that And they'll be like, "Oh, he's gonna do Troy and Abed!"And I'm just like, "Dicks, dicks, dicks, dick, dicks, dicks!"And they're-- "Let's go!"I mean, 'cause I did--I can be gross sometimes and I know it's bad I mean, 'cause I did a half-hour special for Comedy Central And the way I got that half-hour special Was I did an hour in New York I did an hour on my own and Comedy Central was there And they were like, "We really liked your hour."I was like, "Oh, thank you man, that was really great."They were like, "We would love to give you a half-hour."I was like, "Great, would love to do a half-hour."They're like, "Great, but don't do any of the shit you did in that hour It was disgusting, don't do it."Did you guys hear about that Spider-Man thing that happened with me Okay, for those of you who have a life Basically that happened was there was--They were talking about on this geek blog About making Spider-Man, you know, they're redoing it So they said that maybe this new Spider-Man  Since they're making it so quickly after making these other Spider-Mans  Maybe they should make it real different You know, make it kind of like, dark and edgy like "The Dark Knight," and put it in modern-day times and stuff, and maybe-- You know, Spider-Man Maybe doesn't have to be white  Maybe he can be black or Hispanic or something like that  And then somebody put a big picture of me in the comments, and was like, "Donald Glover can play Spider-Man  He's nerdy!"And I was like, "Okay"And somebody sent that to me so I was like, "Oh, yeah, I'll put that up, oh Donald for Spider-Man, let's do this."You know, kind of a joke, but also, like, who doesn't want to be Spider-Man  That'd be cool  And that's when the world went crazy And half the world was like, "Donald for Spider-Man  We're only gonna watch the next Spider-Man if Donald Glover's playing Peter Parker!"And the other half was like, "He's black, kill him!"Like, it was so fast  It was so fast It was insane, like you were either very hot or cold on the subject and I didn't--I didn't say anything, I didn't do anything during that whole time I just laid low, but I did read one comment that was like"Oh, we're gonna make Spider-Man black now  We're just gonna make Spider-Man black now  That's what we're gonna do, we're just gonna make Spider-Man black  That's what we're gonna do, we're gonna make Spider-Man black now  Gonna make Spider-Man black  Well, why don't we just have Michael Cera play Shaft "And I didn't respond to any of the stuff I saw online, except for that one  I wrote back, "Uh, dot, dot, dot, yes!"That would be fucking amazing  If fucking Michael Cera played Shaft  I'd watch that movie every day-- I'd go broke  I'd go broke, just like, yes, one more for "Shaft," please  Like, I'd be there every day I mean, like, wouldn't that be awesome to be watching the movie, just be like, "Hey, Shaft, what's going on, baby ""Oh, nothing, let's find some hoes."Like, that'd be so awesome  I'd watch that all the time  The thing that bothered me the most about that, the thing that really got under my skin was that people kept bringing up Shaft Like I care about Shaft  Like I must care-- He's black, he must love Shaft  Like I give a fuck about Shaft  Like, I'm like, oh no don't take our Shaft  Like, I don't care, I don't care about Shaft Like, it's just like--Like Shaft was the Black Spider-Man or something like that  It's just like, oh, yeah, white people  You guys get this dude who swings from building to building and saves people, and black people, you get this dude who slaps women sometimes  Enjoy!Like, what  No, that's not okay  He's not even a superhero  He's just a black guy  He's just a black dude You couldn't-- He's not a superhero You couldn't have no Shaft ride at Universal Studios  You couldn't have, like--“Yeah, what we do is, we put you in the car And then we set up like five women mannequins And then you hold your hand out and you just slap 'em all, just slap 'em all  $5, please”That's ridiculous  That really bothered me Like, no one-- like, Shaft--I don't give a fuck about Shaft  I don't care about Shaft  The fact that they kept assuming that--Like I woke up every morning, like, in my Shaft pajamas, jumped out of bed, ran down the stairs drank a cup of Shaft juice, turned on the Shaft television--I just realized "Shaft juice" sounds like semen  Don't wanna drink that, that'd be gross & Abed Nadir ]Santa Claus was born in 1945 He had a boogie-woogie Coca-Cola army jive And when the Commies gave
