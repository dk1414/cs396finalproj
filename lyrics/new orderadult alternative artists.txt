How does it feel To treat me like you do When you've laid your hands upon me And told me who you are I thought I was mistaken I thought I heard your words Tell me how do I feel Tell me now, how do I feel Those who came before me Lived through their vocations From the past until completion They'll turn away no more And still, I find it so hard To say what I need to say But, I'm quite sure that you'll tell me Just how I should feel today I see a ship in the harbour I can and shall obey But, if it wasn't for your misfortune I'd be a heavenly person today And I thought I was mistaken And I thought I heard you speak Tell me, how do I feel Tell me now, how should I feel Now I stand here waitingWon't you please let me go These words lie inside, they hurt me so And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you Just what I want to do I'm not the kind that needs to tell you Just what you want me to I saw you this morning I thought that you might like to know I received your message in full a few days ago I understood every word that it said And now that I've actually heard it You're going to regret And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you Just what you want me to You're not the kind that needs to tell me About the birds and the beesEvery time I think of you I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue It's no problem of mine, but it's a problem I find Living a life that I can't leave behind There's no sense in telling me The wisdom of the fool won't set you free But that's the way that it goes and it's what nobody knows Well, every day my confusion grows Every time I see you falling I get down on my knees and pray I'm waiting for that final moment You say the words that I can't say I feel fine and I feel good I'm feeling like I never should Whenever I get this way, I just don't know what to say Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday I'm not sure what this could mean I don't think you're what you seem I do admit to myself that if I hurt someone else Then I'll never see just what we're meant to beI feel so extraordinary Something's got a hold on me I get this feeling I'm in motion A certain sense of liberty I don't care, cause I'm not there And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow Again and again I've taken too much Of the things that cost you too much I used to think that the day would never come I'd see the light in the shade of the morning Sun My morning sun is the drug that brings me near To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear I used to think that the day would never come That my life would depend on the morning Sun When I was a very small boy Very small boys talked to me Now that we've grown up together They're afraid of what they see That's the price that we all pay And the value of destiny comes to nothing I can't tell you where we're going I guess there's just no way of knowingThis is why events unnerve me They find it all, a different story Notice whom for wheels are turning Turn again and turn towards this time All she ask's the strength to hold me Then again the same old story Word will travel, oh so quickly Travel first and lean towards this time Oh, I'll break them all, no mercy shown Heaven knows, it's got to be this time Watching her, these things she said The times she cried Too frail to wake this time Oh, I'll break them down, no mercy shown Heaven knows, it's got to be this time Avenues all lined with trees Picture me and then you start watching Watching forever Forever, watching love grow Forever, letting me know ForeverWell, some of the crowd are on the pitch Well, some of the crowd are on the pitch They think it's all overâ€¦ well, it is now!Express yourself, create the space You know you can win, don't give up the chase Beat the man, take him on You never give up, it's one on one It's one on one It's one on one You can't be wrong When something's good, it's never gone Love's got the world in motion And I know what we can do Love's got the world in motion And I can't believe it's true Now is the time, let everyone see You never give up, that's how it should be Don't get caught, make your own play Express yourself, don't give it awayA heaven, a gateway, a hope Just like a feeling I need, it's no joke And though it hurts me to treat you this way Betrayed by words I'd never heard, too hard to say Oh, up, down, turn around Please don't let me hit the ground Tonight, I think I'll walk alone I'll find my soul as I go home Up, down, turn around Please don't let me hit the ground Tonight, I think I'll walk alone I'll find my soul as I go home Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh-ooh Each way I turn, I know I'll always try To break this circle that has been placed around me From time to time, I find I've lost some need That was so urgent to myself, I do believeOn a thousand islands in the sea I see a thousand people just like me A hundred unions in the snow I watch them walking, falling in a row We live always underground It's going to be so quiet in here tonight There's a thousand islands in the sea It's a shame And a hundred years ago A sailor trod this ground I stood upon Take me away everyone When it hurts thou From my head to my toes From the words in the book I see a vision that would bring me luck From my head to my toes To my teeth, through my nose You get these words wrong You get these words wrong Every time You get these words wrong I just smileMaybe I've forgotten the name and the address Of everyone I've ever known, it's nothing I regret Save it for another day, it's the school exam The kids have run away I would like a place I could call my own Have a conversation on the telephone Wake up every day, that would be a start I would not complain of my wounded heart I was upset, you see, almost all the time You used to be a stranger, now you are mine I wouldn't even trust you, I've not got much to give We're dealing in the limits, and we don't know who with You may think that I'm out of hand, that I'm naive, I'll understand On this occasion it's not true Look at me, I'm not you I would like a place I could call my own Have a conversation on the telephone Wake up every day, that would be a start I would not complain of my wounded heart I was a short fuse burning all the time You were a complete stranger, now you are mineHow does it feel To treat me like you do When you've laid your hands upon me And told me who you are I thought I was mistaken I thought I heard your words Tell me how do I feel Tell me now, how do I feel Those who came before me Lived through their vocations From the past until completion They'll turn away no more And still, I find it so hard To say what I need to say But, I'm quite sure that you'll tell me Just how I should feel today I see a ship in the harbour I can and shall obey But, if it wasn't for your misfortune I'd be a heavenly person today And I thought I was mistaken And I thought I heard you speak Tell me, how do I feel Tell me now, how should I feel Now I stand here waiting
