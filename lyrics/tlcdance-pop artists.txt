the window Staring at a son that she just can't touch If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much But all the praying just ain't helping at all'Cause he can't seem to keep himself out of trouble So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how Another body laying cold in the gutter Listen to me Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're moving too fast Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation But he just can't see She gives him loving that his body can't handle But all he can say is, "Baby, it's good to me"One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror But he doesn't recognize his own face His health is fading, and he doesn't know why Three letters took him to his final resting place Y'all don't hear meI wish I could tie you up in my shoes Make you feel unpretty too I was told I was beautiful But what does that mean to you Look into the mirror, who's inside there The one with the long hair Same old me again today, yeah My outsides look cool, my insides look blue Every time I think I'm through, it's because of you I tried different ways, but it's all the same At the end of the day I have myself to blame I'm just trippin'You can buy your hair if it won't grow You can fix your nose if he says so You can buy all the make-up That M.A.C  can make, but if You can't look inside you Find out who am I to Be in the position that made me feel So damn unpretty
