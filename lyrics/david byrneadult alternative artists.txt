I wish I was a camera I wish I was a postcard I welcome you to my house You didn't have to go far A house and a garden There are, there's plants and trees Make a, a closer inspection If you get, get down on your knees Now everybody's coming to my house And I'm never gonna  be alone And everybody's coming to my house And they're never gonna go back home I'm pointing and describing And I can be your guide The skin is just a roadmap The view is very nice Imagine looking at a picture Imagine driving in a car Imagine rolling down the window Imagine opening the doorThe rose is pruned to a perfect shape Perfect for whom, I wonder The chicken thinks in mysterious ways But beauty is not what we're after Now the chicken imagines a heaven Full of roosters and plenty of corn And God is a very old rooster And eggs are like Jesus, his son Every day is a miracle Every day is an unpaid bill You've got to sing for your supper Love one another A cockroach might eat Mona Lisa The pope don't mean shit to a dog And elephants don't read newspapers And the kiss of a chicken is hot The brain of a chicken And the dick of a donkey A pig in a blanket And that's why you want me What does it feel like To be your tongue Moving around in your mouth To be free in the forest of your love A cockroach in the cosmos of your houseWho’ll be my valentine Who’ll lift this heavy load Who’ll share this taxi cab Who wants to climb aboard Who is an honest man Who is an honest man Who’ll help the tired soldier Far from his own hometown Carry these men and women Who get lost when the Sun goes down Who is an honest man Who is an honest man Who walks this dusty road Who always pulls their weight Who’s this   Inside of me Who made a big mistakeI wake up every morning I hear your feet on the stairs You're in the next apartment I hear you singing over there This groove is out of fashion These beats are 20 years old I saw you lend a hand to The ones out standing in the cold Strange overtones in the music you are playing I'll harmonize It is strong and you are tough But a heart is not enough Put on your socks and mittens It's getting colder tonight A snowball in my kitchen I watched it melt before my eyes Your song still needs a chorus I know you'll figure it out The rising of the verses A change of key will let you outHere is a region of abundant details Here is a region that is seldom used Here is a region that continues living Even when the other sections are removed Put your hand out of your pocket Wipe the sweat off of your brow Now it feels like a bad connection No more information now As it passes through your neurons Like a whisper in the dark Raise your eyes to one who loves you It is safe right where you are Here is an area of great confusion Here is a section that's extremely precise And here is an area that needs attention Here is a connection with the opposite side Here, too many sounds for your brain to comprehend Here the sound gets organised into things that make some sense Here there is something we call elucidation Is it the truth or merely a description I'm lazy when I'm lovin', I'm lazy when I play I'm lazy with my girlfriend a thousand times a day I'm lazy when I'm speaking, I'm lazy when I walk I'm lazy when I'm dancin' and I'm lazy when I talk I open up my mouth, air comes rushin' out Nothin', doin' nada, never, how you like me now Wouldn't it be mad, wouldn't it be fine Lazy, lucky lady, dancin', lovin' all the time Oh, I'm wicked and I'm lazy Oh, don't you wanna save me Lazy, lazy Lazy, lazy Now some folks they got money and some folks lives are sweet And some folks make decisions and some folks clean the streets, now Imagine what it feels like, imagine how it sounds If everything were perfect and everything works out No tears are fallin' from my eyes I'm keepin' all the pain inside Now don't you wanna live with me I'm lazy as a man can beIn another dimension Like the clothes that you wear A mighty, mighty battle Sproutin' illegal hair A fitness consultant In the negative zone Wanderin' the city Lookin' for a home I dance like this Because it feels so damn good If I could dance better Well, you know that I would How the rumor got started Oh, one can only guess And the truth don't mean nothin'If you ain't got the cash A credit card mommy An invisible dad Career opportunities That you never hadFor millions of years In millions of homes A man loved a woman A child it was born It learned how to hurt and it learned how to cry Like humans do I'm breathing in I'm breathing out So slip inside this funky house Dishes in the sink The T V's in repair Don't look at the floor Don't go up the stairs I'm achin'I'm shakin'I'm breakin' like Humans do I'm achin'I'm shakin'I'm breakin' like Humans doI used to think that I should watch T VI used to think that it was good for me Wanted to know what folks were thinking To understand the land I live in And I would lose myself And it would set me free This is the place where common people go A global franchise; one department store Yes, there were many awkward moments I had to do some self-atonement Well, if I opened up Well, it would set me free I know, I like Behold and love this giant Big soul, big lips That's me and I am this Everybody gets a touched up hairdo Everybody's in the passing lane Had a reason that she touched all channels The weird things that live in there I took a walk down to the park today I wrote a song called "Just Like You and Me"I heard the jokes from the sports reporter The rival teams when they faced each other The more I lost myself, the more it set me freeI love America Her secret's safe with me And I know her wicked ways The parts you never see Oh super-girl, you'll be my super-model Although you have a reputation Can I afford to move above my station I'm not the only heart you've conquered And I love America But boy can she be cruel And I know how tall she is Without her platform shoes Oh super-girl, you'll be my super-model Although at times it might seem awkward Don't run away, oh don't you recognize me I'm not the only heart you've conquered And I kissed America When she was fleecing me She knows I understand that she needs to be free
