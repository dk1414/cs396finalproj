If you're gonna tell them everything Tell 'em I'm a good kisser Tell 'em all the things you told me In your desperate whisper If you're gonna tell them everything Don't leave out the good part Tell 'em the way that you broke my heart When you told me that you missed her Tell 'em I'm a good kisser Tell 'em I'm a good kisser You know I'm not proud of the thing that we did Didn't walk out, just the way that you wanted it After it all, I stood up tall I kept my mouth shut so you wouldn't fall Now everybody's talking 'bout me'Cause you would dirty me up just to get yourself clean Get yourself clean If you're gonna tell them everything Tell 'em I'm a good kisser Tell 'em all the things you told me In your desperate whisper If you're gonna tell them everything Don't leave out the good part Tell 'em the way that you broke my heart When you told me that you missed herI could spend ages reading the news I could spend days singing the blues But I turn up the T V light Give up without a fight Better than pretending To know what's wrong and what's right I could spend ages asking myself why There's a million ways that I could say goodbye But I turn down the lights Come on, baby, come inside Better than being Some fool's bride Better than pretending To know what's wrong and what's rightWould it be true to say that I ordered you Or is it you that ordered me I could say you are the only one I see But I can't stop at two or three And I am afraid to need you so And I am too sober not to know That you may be my problem, not my love Would I be lying if I said you were too sweet Though I'm quite sure you've got a bite I could say that you were just a special treat Though we both know that's not right And I am afraid to need you so And I am too sober not to know That you may be my problem, not my love'Cause you go down smooth Would it be true to say you go to my head Or is that sentiment too frank Oh, I could say you make it sweet to go to bed But then it's you that breaks the bankNobody knows what I'm doing here And I ain't got a clue Messing around with these other fools When I'm not with you There's been so many nights When I've longed for your touch There's been so many days When our love was not enough Oh, leave me Just leave me, leave me Can't you see me See me-Nobody knows what I'm doing here And I ain't got a clue Messing around with these other fools When I'm not with you There's been so many nights When I've longed for your touch There's been so many days When our love was not enough Oh, leave me Just leave me, leave me Can't you see me See me-I know the outcome And I'm not blind I've been standing right here before And I do it every time I never think I lose But it's a losing game And I'm breaking all the rules Thinking that I'm gonna change Oh, it's good That these men don't know each other I got one who's working undercover Trying to solve my mystery Look at what mistake I'm making now I'm jumping right on in When I know it's gonna end somehow Look at what mistake I'm making now I'm jumping right on in When I know it's gonna end somehow I've told these stories And I've said these lies I ignore what my heart tells me And I break it every timeHard times, hard times When I really need somebody to hold me tight And tell me that I'm strong Last night, last night You were really there for me, so thank you For playin' along But I gotta be honest with ya, baby This is not about love I gotta be honest with ya, baby I'm not above usin' you to get me through the night Baby, don't leave me alone with my thoughts I don't wanna get caught in the current of my mind Baby, don't leave me alone with my thoughts An old man, an old man Has got his little hands on the button Feels like nothin' anyone can do People out there crackin' up, crackin' up And I'm just tryin' to keep it together Notice that I feel better when I'm holdin' youObviously, we're at the beginning of something I don't expect you to know where it's gonna go But I believe we might be onto something And I just thought maybe you should know I've been playing out a lot of hypotheticals in my mind I've been writing your name down next to mine Been imagining all the things you and I could do I've seen all the possibilities in my dreams You're alone when you should really be next to me Baby, let's not wait and see Immediate action is unnecessary It's a fatal attraction, it's a little scary But I got a plan of attack And I'll get us therе someday soon, I know it I got a plan A and I got a plan B And if it's absolutely necеssary, we'll go to plan C Whatever I gotta do to be with you I've been playing out a lot of hypotheticals in my mind I've been writing your name down next to mine Been imagining all the things you and I could do I've seen all the possibilities in my dreams You're alone when you should really be next to me Baby, let's not wait and seeLittle hands hold the gavel Another one's about to fall down Get upset and unravel Another one's about to fall down Shame, shame, shame Shame, shame, shame on you Every place that you travel Another one's about to fall down Little face in the gravel Another one's about to fall down Pain, pain, pain Shame, shame, shame on you I bet you think you're a big man now But you don't know how to be a good man too No, I'm not getting caught in your little spiderweb Won't let an angry dog get me down Don't you think it's time we put this dog out of his misery Lay down good, the summer's coming on Take off your makeup and take off your shoes Trade in a dress for something oversized And let your mind go wherever you choose Don't try to be a woman anymore Nobody's taught you how Skin your knees and throw punches in the air Nobody's stopping you now It's okay to step away from the crowd Nobody's stopping you now You're on the cusp of an obsession Time is not on your side All winter trying for perfection But somehow, you're never satisfied And that hunger'll last you for a lifetime Until you learn how to set it down Sip the nectar from a honеysuckle bush'Cause nobody's stopping you now It's okay to let thе real you out Nobody's stopping you nowTo the next generation, merry Christmas You're working harder than ever now and the coffee sucks You know Colombia and Kenya got too damn hot And now you're making do with what you've got Everybody knew Reading all the same headlines Blowing through the traffic signs Looking for the cops But what could you do Can't you see it clear as glass Going through it if we crash But we're never gonna stop Killer waves and riots Coming to the coastline soon Counting up the new typhoons Quicker than kilowatts How could you deny it Living like your eyes are shut I guess it's hard to be a human It's еven harder to be not Whеn you're making do with what you've got Where are all the heroes Perfect teeth glistening Big strong chins Shooting for the moonshots Like going sixty to zero Slowing down few and far between Everything true it seems like we forgot I don't wanna lie What do I say to my baby girl Leaving her with half a world That we coulda done a lot I just wanna die If she wants what she can't become And she can't blame anyone Because it's no one's fault When you're making do with what you've got
