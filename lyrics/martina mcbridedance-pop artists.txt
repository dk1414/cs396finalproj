If there were no words No way to speak I would still hear you If there were no tears No way to feel inside I'd still feel for you And even if the sun refused to shine Even if romance ran out of rhyme You would still have my heart Until the end of time You're all I need, my love, my Valentine All of my life I have been waiting for All you give to me You've opened my eyes And shown me how to love unselfishly I've dreamed of this a thousand times before In my dreams I couldn't love you more I will give you my heart Until the end of time You're all I need, my love, my valentineWell, she seemed alright by dawn's early light Though she looked a little worried and weak She tried to pretend he wasn't drinkin' again But daddy left the proof on her cheek And I was only eight years old that summer And I always seemed to be in the way So, I took myself down to the fair in town On Independence Day Well, word gets around in a small, small town They said he was a dangerous man But mama was proud and she stood her ground She knew she was on the losin' end Some folks whispered, some folks talked But everybody looked the other way When time ran out there was no one about On Independence Day Let freedom ring Let the white dove sing Let the whole world know that today Is a day of reckoning Let the weak be strong Let the right be wrong Roll the stone away Let the guilty pay It's Independence DayThis is for all you girls about 13 High school can be so rough, can be so mean Hold on to, on to your innocence Stand your ground when everybody's giving in This one's for the girls This is for all

in the way for you and me I've known you just a week or two But baby I'm so into you Can hardly breathe And I'm in so totally wrapped up Emotionally attracted So physically acting So recklessly I need

confirmed her fears Her husband held it in and held her tight Cancer don’t discriminate or care if you’re just 38 With three kids who need you in their lives He said, "I know that you’re afraid and I am, too But you’ll never be alone, I promise you"When you’re weak, I’ll be strong When you let go, I’ll hold on When you need to cry, I swear that I’ll be there to dry your eyes When you feel lost and scared to death Like you can’t take one more step Just take my hand, together we can do it I'm going to love you through it She made it through the surgery fine They said they caught it just in time But they had to take more than they planned Now it's forced smiles and baggy shirts To hide what the cancer took from her But she just wants to feel like a woman again She said, "I don't think I can do this anymore"He took her in his arms and said "That's what my love is for"You can spend your whole life buildin'Somethin' from nothin'One storm can come and blow it all away Build it anyway You can chase a dream That seems so out of reach And you know it might not ever come your way Dream it anyway God is great, but sometimes life ain't good And when I pray It doesn't always turn out like I think it should But I do it anyway, I do it anyway This world's gone crazy And it's hard to believe That tomorrow will be better than today Believe it anyway You can love someone with all your heart For all the right reasons And in a moment they can choose to walk away Love 'em anyway God is great But sometimes life ain't good And when I pray It doesn't always turn out like I think it should But I do it anyway Yeah, I do it anywayDon't need no copy of Vogue magazine Don't need to dress like no Beauty Queen High heels or sneakers, he don't give a damn My baby loves me just the way that I am My baby loves me just the way that I am He never tells me I'm not good enough Just gives me unconditional love He loves me tender, he loves me mad He loves me silly and he loves me sad He thinks I'm pretty, he thinks I'm smart He likes my nerve and he loves my heart He's always saying he's my biggest fan My baby loves me just the way that I am My baby loves me just the way that I am When there's dark clouds in my eyes He just sits back and lets 'em roll on by Come in like a lion and go out like a lamb My baby loves me just the way that I am My baby loves me just the way that I amShe walks to school with the lunch she packed Nobody knows what she's holdin' back Wearin' the same dress she wore yesterday She hides the bruises with linen and lace The teacher wonders, but she doesn't ask It's hard to see the pain behind the mask Bearin' the burden of a secret storm Sometimes she wishes she was never born Through the wind and the rain She stands hard as a stone In a world that she can't rise above But her dreams give her wings And she flies to a place where she's loved Concrete angel Somebody cries in the middle of the night The neighbours hear, but they turn out the light A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate When mornin' comes it'll be too lateShe loved him like he was The last man on Earth Gave him everything she ever had He'd break her spirit down Then come loving up on her Give a little, then take it back She'd tell him about her dreams He'd just shoot 'em down Lord he loved to make her cry"You're crazy for believing You'll ever leave the ground"He said, "Only angels know how to fly"And with a broken wing She still sings She keeps an eye on the sky With a broken wing She carries her dreams Man, you ought to see her fly One Sunday morning She didn't go to church He wondered why she didn't leave He went up to the bedroom Found a note by the window With the curtains blowin' in the breeze
