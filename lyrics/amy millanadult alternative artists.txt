Skinny boy, all bones, no lies You're so miserable in the morning Will you wait up for me It's sordid and I can't find my feet And you've got lips I could spend a day with Skinny boy, somewhere some prostitution Some denial, some doubt, some dance They're coming with swords through the backdoor And there you are on the fence With those lips I could spend a day with When it's done, I'll drink champagne To the lonely, lonely in me Monday, Tuesday, so lonely Wednesday, Thursday, only me Friday, Saturday, only me Here comes SundayBaby, baby, since you've been gone, I ain't doing so good I don't get up, paint my face, and go out like I should Baby, you turned a clear night sky into a dark, dark hole And when I see a sunset now, I'm just looking at a painting in a cheap motel Baby, I'm going on without you Maybe I'm even gonna get through But baby, I'll tell you something that'll never be true Baby, I'll get over you Sometimes I feel that my only friend is a whisky glass You know it don't stop the time, but it helps it pass That old sun coming in my room, well, it hurts my eyes I see people walking out on the day, but I stay inside I needed to hide Baby, I'm going on without you Maybe I'm even gonna get through But baby, I'll tell you something that'll never be true Baby, I'll get over you I'll get over you when the moon gets tired of chasing the sun I'll get over you when all God's work on Earth is done And on that day when I go to meet my maker's son I'll need no one and I'll be over youLove of mine Someday you will die I will be close behind Follow you into the dark No blinding light Tunnels of gates of white Our hands clasped so tight Waiting for the hint of a spark If heaven and hell decide That they both are satisfied Illuminate the N O's on their vacancy signs If there's no one beside you When your soul embarks Then I'll follow you into the dark In Catholic school As vicious as Roman rule I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black I held my tongue as she told me"Son, fear is the heart of love"So I never went back If heaven and hell decide That they both are satisfied Illuminate the N O's on their vacancy signs If there's no one beside you When your soul embarks Then I'll follow you into the darkIt's not what you thought What are the reasons for believing Believing a body heads south'Cause your mouth on my mouth A fire I just can't put out It's a fever I just can't Stop what I start Apart from believing It's the leaving, the leaving My body heads west And I know you can't I know you can't I know you want it And I know you can't I know you can't I know you want me The faces I never thought I'd be The places I never thought I'd go Goes to show, goes to show Goes to show love is crazyHe brings out the whiskey in me When it's later than night-time And all that's good is asleep He brings out the whiskey in me We were just thirteen years old When my daddy's liquor cabinet That was usually closed Is where we found Canadian Gold When you're gettin' over troubles around When you're gettin' over lovers that have let you down When you're paying for the past, it all don't seem so bad When ice is ringing in your whiskey glass I can hear the first morning train It's quarter to dawn And the bottle is gone Go to sleep before the sun gets strong When you're gettin over troubles around When you're gettin over lovers that have let you down When you're paying for that past, it all don't seem so bad When ice is ringing in your whiskey glass He brings out the whiskey in me When it's later than night-time And all that's good is asleep He brings out the whiskey in meYour eyes are like burned-out headlights A little thunder in the night I'm losin' you You're walking around like you live in a graveyard Catching the one with the cards I'm losin' you I guess I'll go and I'll lock the door behind me What's it for when you've only got time you gotta leave behind You nod and smile like a lying stranger When I ask if you're doing all right I'm losin' you And underneath the hungry silence Fear is eatin' through I'm losin' you I guess I'll go and I'll lock the door behind me What's it for when you've only got time you gotta leave behind I'm not the kind to beat you from behind I'm not the kind to tell you you've been blind I'm not the type to put up a fightCome along, Ruby Where have you gone You've got eyes like the North Dakota sun Got lips like an ocean and skin like rain Whole lot of whisky and wine and propane Took me to Nashville to sing with the band And then you left me in Tulsa sleepin' in the van A dollar and a daisy is all that you left Lock up my heart and forget about the rest Lock up my heart, forget about the rest A year and a day is all that it's been My Ruby's still singin' and I'm drinkin' gin Lost all my money on the Saratoga track Lost all my time hopin' you would come back Lost all my time hopin' you would come back Come along, Ruby Where have you gone You've got eyes like the North Dakota sun Got lips like an ocean and skin like the rain I wonder if I'll ever see you again I feel as blue as the blue in your eyes I feel as old as the old man telling lies I feel as lucky as a horseshoe on the door Lord, but I don't think I can take this world no more No, I don't think I can take it anymore Ain't it hard to keep your eyes closed sometimes Ain't it hard to turn away Ain't it hard to feel the sunshine sometimes It feels just like another rainy day I feel more burdened as the bourbon starts to seep Hoping it will help me get sleep I feel as lonesome as the woman in the moon Hoping that you'll be beside me soon I'm hoping that you'll lie next to me soon Ain't it hard to keep your eyes closed sometimes Ain't it hard to turn away Ain't it hard to feel the sunshine sometimes It feels just like another rainy dayI've been feeling sick all day Wish I'd asked you to stay'Cause I need a little takin' care of Maybe you didn't know I didn't want you to go But who do I say it to now though You're like an old perfume That brings back memories That old forgotten tune Better I recall I've been wrongly turned away You say you're meant for someone other Discontented pearl Floating on the shoreline In waters dark and cold Under the shadow of a girl I wish I could have said All that was in my head Now darlin', you will never know That I loved you so You're like an old perfume That brings back memories That old forgotten tune Better I recallLater here this morning If the crowds hold back the rain I'll declare my intent to race again Baby, I've done running I've cut myself a deal I gave myself a ladder This time for real And I've got nothing on the inside left to charm, just look at me And I've got nothing to live up to and I have nothing to reveal Go on, run for me, go on, run for me Go on, run for me 'cause I can't take it back Gone the summer, gone the past, and now it's gone Now it's gone The lane is laid with ashes My road is paved with fear I bathed myself in sweet grass to tame the years And I've got nothing on the inside left to charm, just look at me And I've got nothing to live up to and I have nothing to reveal Go on, run for me, go on, run for me Go on, run for me 'cause I can't take it back Gone the summer, gone the past, and now it's gone Now it's gone
