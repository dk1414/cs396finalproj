you look at me with those eyes and then...You introduce me to your lovely girlfriend I hope she breaks your heart I hope she tears you apart That she makes you feel the hurt I feel for you I hope she breaks your heart Keeps you crying in the dark That she leaves you loving her the way that I'm still loving you I force a smile and we talk a while I look at her and I wish I wore my dress Lost for
