Love is no fun anymore There's too many things I can't afford So what do you mean when you say That she's your girlfriend today I wouldn't ever wanna rush you Don't want to lose you I'd never fuss you But I love a love a love you Don't wanna lose you I'd never fuss you But I love a love a love you Love's not beating down on my door I guess it's cause ooh, I got lucky, lucky before I wouldn't ever wanna rush you Don't want to lose you I'd never fuss you But I love a love a love you Don't wanna lose you I'd never fuss you But I love a love a love youOh I wake up feeling the same way every day Aching numb with the pain that I can't chase away So I'm wondering who's taking up your sacred precious time Living from day to day without a single sign Would I lie  Oh, no One word, one letter, one line And I'd feel a whole lot better One look would say it's alright And I'd feel a whole lot better My heart breaks the way you turn your back and carry on And my head hurts 'cause I just can't work out why it all went wrong So I'm wondering, oh, the more I think the less I understand Leaving is easy when you know you're in command Would I lie  Oh, no One word, one letter, one line And I'd feel a whole lot better One look would say it's alright And I'd feel a whole lot better Yes, I'd feel a whole lot better, nowDon't look for me now, I'm safe where I am Happy and listed under another name And he is good to me and she is gorgeous And they love me and I adore them If this were a book it would start with the line"I once knew a man, I was his and he was mine"So predictable, so confused I'm at a loss for words to explain my mood I stitch this poem to the bottom of my dress One that touches me directly on my legs Yeah, I work that poem up until it sits over my heart And I hold it tight and dream La, la, la La, la, la, la, la La, la, la La, la, la, la, la If this were a book it would start with the line"I once knew a man, I was his and he was mine"So predictable, so confused I'm at a loss for words to explain my moodToo young to know, too old to listen You live your life inside a day dream Your lovers pride worn like a costume Too blind to see what you're missing Well if you love yourself in the morning Loosen up your little bow tie You know you gave me an early warning Early warning Wall to wall mirrors in your bathroom You can see yourself dressing with your back turned You love your wife 'cause she's a challenge You love your wife 'cause she's a challenge Well if you love yourself in the morning Loosen up your little bow tie You know you gave me an early warning Early warningYou want to feel a little warmth, a little mercy You want to feel like this is real but it's so cold this time of year And everywhere you liked to go is a reminder Oh, you can smell him in the air But this is just being unfair I don't care 'cause life was never meant to be painless What I would give Painless An adjective Painless Not gonna beg to be a leg of your adventure Not gonna cry, I'm gonna laugh, it's like a little game of chance We all anticipate the elements of nature Well yesterday was years ago and you have nothing more to show I don't care 'cause I was always meant to be here What I would give Painless An adjective Painless Oh he's my prince of love Painless Sweet tooth of sin, oh All I need is a friend Someone to give me a helping hand When I'm afraid in the night Someone to squeeze me and tell me it's alright Baby baby, be my friend Baby baby, be my friend You know I worry such a lot And I would give all I got Just to have someone believe in me Just to do that and put me back on evenly Baby baby, be my friend Baby baby, be my friend Baby baby, be my friend And I will love you to the very end You make me feel a stronger love Than anyone I've ever known Oh, I need, I need, I need someone, someone like you You give me something so strong and true Won't you be my friend Baby baby be my friend Won't you be my friend I will love you, love you to the very endIf all you want is a little piece of ass All you'll get is a little piece of me You won't get no cheap satisfaction'Cause I don't give my love for free You'll get your fingers burned You'll get what you deserved And what you stand to lose, oh yeah, yeah Is looking at you looking at you, looking at you You ain't gonna get no love tonight You're getting what you're given but you ain't got it right I don't like your attitude, oh, oh, oh You call the shots when you're in the mood, yeah I don't want this same conversation I don't need these little boy lines I'll get by on my good reputation You can find another love like mine It's not the game to blame It's just the way you play it And what you stand to lose, oh yeah, yeah Is looking at you looking at you, looking at youWave if you want me to notice you Stop if you have someone else It could be a good thing, might be a bad thing But you can't put your arms around a memory Break my, break my heart I wish, oh, I wish you would You've had time to waste, time to wonder Time to become someone else Looks could kill me, lies they don't pretend You want to remember, but you can't put your arms around a memory Break my, break my heart Oh, I wish you would Wasted waiting, just like white ain't black Like trying to get you baby, oh yeah Break my, break my heart Oh, I wish you would Wasted waiting, just like white ain't black Like trying to get you babyHave you ever wondered how a love can lift you up and then take you down In case you haven't noticed you're about to be a loser in this round Tell yourself it's all too hard Working for the enemy You think there's something crazy going on inside your head behind your eyes While you light a cigarette, you try to hide the fire from the spies Tell yourself it's all too hard Working for the enemy Looking back you must have been Working for the enemy Working for the enemy Working for the enemy Tell yourself it's all too hard Working for the enemy Looking back you must have been Tell yourself, "Not this time"Working for the enemy Looking back you must have been Working for the enemy Working for the enemy You can't look before you open your eyes You won't learn without an open mind We all pray to the same god We all pray to the same god Ooh, it's a waste of time Ooh, it's a weight in my mind Some men dream of their life after death Some of Heaven or Hell We all pray to the same god We all pray to the same god Ooh, it's a waste of time Ooh, it's a weight in my mind Ooh, it's a waste of time Ooh, it's a weight in my mind Slick religion is more than a threat It's a killer disease It's deception in the highest form And it's all born from un-love and greed
