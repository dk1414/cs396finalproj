Until the day I die I'll spill my heart for you, for you Until the day I die I'll spill my heart for you As years go by I'd race the clock with you But if you died right now You know that I'd die too I'd die too You remind me of the times When I knew who I was But still the second hand will catch us Like it always does We'll make the same mistakes I'll take the fall for you I hope you need this now Because I know I still do Until the day I die I'll spill my heart for you Until the day I die I'll spill my heart for youI'm scared that every time I say I'm sorry That I'm more the man I never planned to be But the saddest part is that I've stopped believing In every word I've said along the way And I'm Sorry But I swear, I'm okay Those little words don't mean a thing When I know, there's no way We'll ever be the same Cause nothing can replace When it's all falling down like rain But I swear, I'm okay The only words I have to say I've seen a mountain crumble down around me Like an avalanche of medicine and fear I can tell myself that I am not my father But it seems that I get closer every year And I'm sorry But I swear, I'm okay Those little words don't mean a thing When I know, there's no way We'll ever be the same Cause nothing can replace When it's all falling down like rain But I swear, I'm okay The only words I have to sayGo!If you close your eyes, your life, a naked truth revealed Dreams you never lived and scars never healed In the darkness, light will take you to the other side Find me waiting there, you'll see if you just close your eyes If you just close your eyes If you just close your eyes Decieved by my eyes, and all I was told I should see Opinions not mine, the person they taught me to be One night in the dark, a vision of someone I know And out of the darkness I heard a voice say "I'm you"Inside of me a light was turned on Then I was alive If you close your eyes, your life, a naked truth revealed Dreams you never lived and scars never healed In the darkness light will take you to the other side Find me waiting there, you'll see if you just close your eyes Hearts uninspired, trapped inside somebody's dream Too close to the fire, yet cold and so numb with the pain But the fever has broken, and the river has run to the sea Washed to the ocean and saved by a voice inside me Inside of me a light was turned on Then I was aliveLast night I had that dream again I tried to run back to you But the devil held me by my sins Till I had nothing to lose And I woke up calling out your name, but The past it hangs like a noose And for me to ever let you down was The last thing that I wanted to do I need this more than you know I need a miracle Tell me I'm not alone Please don't let me go I need this more than you know I need a miracle Tell me I'm not alone Please don't let me go I'll pull the knife out slow Till I'm somebody new And then just before the blood runs down I'll tell you that this is all for youI wish that I could pretend There's a place for me with the skeletons Where I never have to hide And a god above who tucks me in at night But this is more like the end Of a fucked up dream where I swear to myself I'll make it out alive But before the angel can save my soul I let her go Bang  Bang!A bullet to my head Hey  Hey!Alive amongst the dead One last kiss before I go Whoah  Whoah!Bang  Bang!A bullet to my head Hey  Hey!Alive amongst the dead One last kiss before I go Whoah  Whoah!Now it's hard for me to keep smiling While I'm begging for a knife To carve away the thoughts of you and I But at least I can say That I've learned something about giving up And fighting for my life Give me one last try and I'll get it right Or say goodbyeThe stars will cry The blackest tears tonight And this is the moment that I live for I can smell the ocean air And here I am Pouring my heart onto these rooftops Just a ghost to the world That's exactly Exactly what I need From up here the city lights burn Like a thousand miles of fire And I'm here to sing this anthem Of our dying day For a second I wish the tide Would swallow every inch of this city As you gasp for air tonight I'd scream this song right in your face If you were here I swear I won't miss a beat'Cause I never Never have beforeThe bridge is all crumbled, the water soaks into rocks That fell at the bottom of the road The town that we lived in, the memories shaken apart From the weeds that grow Over the sidewalks Running away from the streets we knew Sidewalks, like the time we thought was made for you Out on the front porch watching the cars as they go by Eighteen blue, twenty-one gray Looking ahead for the first time that we could drive out on our own To speed away From the sidewalks Running away from the streets we knew Sidewalks, like the time we thought was made for you All of the days have passed us by All of the sun is gone...Away Sidewalks, running away from the streets we knew Sidewalks, running away from the streets we knew Sidewalks, like the time we thought was made for you The bridge is all crumbled, the water soaks into rocks That fell at the bottom of the roadThe night will come And rip away Her wings of innocence through every word we say Maybe it's time To spit out the core of our rotting union Hopefully before it chokes Us to our senses Guess it's too bad That everything we have Is taken away Swim in the smoke The hero will drown Intoxicating beauty tears everything down But still our hands Are bound at the wrists This romantic tragedy is suffocating from your fist In a sea of fire Hero, hero, this word you'll never know Hero, hero, this word you'll never know You'll never knowI found an angel near the edge I felt her placed against my skin I saw the face of God, I know You're more than me, I know I need you When it's a sound that makes you live The way the needle breaks the skin And all I want's to keep you safe But how can we go on this way Now I'm wide awake, staring at the ceiling As time is counting my days Like a tidal wave, tearing me to pieces As I'm praying for rain to carry me away It's a simple life we live Where every moment's like a gift And just a song could help you sleep But it's hard to sing with broken wings Wide awake, staring at the ceiling As time is counting my days Like a tidal wave, tearing me to pieces As I'm praying for rain to carry me away To carry me away To carry me away To carry me awayCan anybody hear me Is anybody listening at all Why is it so lonely right before you take the fall If I could have found the words to say to you that night Would you have even noticed Would you have even noticed I'm dying here pretending I'm just fine Just waiting for a moment A tiny little moment These nightmares they keep me awake at night I don't think these demons can see How alone I really am Can anybody hear me Is anybody listening at all Why is it so lonely right before you take the fall Can anybody hear me Is anybody listening at all Or am I the only one Only one
