They can make things worse for me Sometimes I'd rather die They can tell me lots of things But I can't see eye to eye Well, I know they know the way I think I know they always will But someday I'm gonna change my mind Sometimes I'd rather kill Bloodstains, speed kills Fast cars, cheap thrills Rich girls, fine wine I've lost my sense, I've lost control, I've lost my mind Things seem so much different now The scene has died away I haven't got a steady job And I've got no place to stay Well, it's a futuristic modern world But things aren't what they seem Someday you'd better wake up From this stupid fantasyThings don't seem to be as easy As they used to be It's getting harder every day To think of better things to say About what's going on around you And what's happening inside you When it's time to change, you won't know how It won't matter years from now No matter what you think, or do, or say Everything turns grey This is it, the darkest hour Isn't it depressing how our Minds create an atmosphere That won't happen here Unless we make some new demands To grasp the future in our hands You know, I wish I could But it's too late for senseless minds who love to hate No matter what they think, or do, or say Everything turns greyI'm sick of colored hair Don't care about what you wear I hate the things I see Don't care about anarchy I'm sick of boring bands Rock stars and all their fans The new wave overtones And all the leather jacket clones I'm so bored of you I'm sick of pins and chains Hard drugs and dizzy brains I'm sick of cheap romance People who never dance I'm sick of all the drunks The posers and the punks The stupid things they've done I'm getting sick of everyoneSometimes I think of old friends but they all seem the same Then I see them and they can't remember my name I guess I'm just like them, I guess I'm just a bore I could hate them but I've never done that before I've got lots of good friends I don't want any more Sometimes when you lie to me, sometimes I'll lie to you And there isn't a thing you could possibly do All these half destroyed lives aren’t as bad as the seem And then I see blood and I hear people scream Then I wake up and it's just another bad dream And I can't help myself by feeling sorry Because I gave up every chance I had It's not a movement, it's just another fad Like a cry for help in a world gone mad And I can't help myself by feeling sorry I know I gave up every chance I had It's not a movement, it's just another fad Like a cry for help in a world gone madI didn't expect them to know my name Surrounding me like a black steel frame I saw the world go up in flames And I just smiled and stood there, watching And it doesn't seem like this is real That's just the way I feel I don't know why Well, I learned from my mistakes This time, I will escape I'm too young to die We're all too young to die It doesn't seem like this is real I guess it's just the way I feel I don't know why Well, I learned from my mistakes This time, I will escape I'm too young to dieThey can make things worse for me Sometimes I'd rather die They can tell me lots of things But I can't see eye to eye Well, I know they know the way I
