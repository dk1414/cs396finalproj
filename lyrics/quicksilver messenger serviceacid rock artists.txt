saw his moving ever on the run, from and to the sound of one Turning in, turning out, spirals high, never down Wonder, wonder wanders, loving, loving lovers Freefall, tumbling walls, one world, one one truth If if it's above life is low, life is slow Love is life, it's love, loveJust about love, like the wing of some high-flying bird Of the songs I will sing to you, you can hear every word That I ever heard come to you Of the people I've been, of the visions I have seen And the places I have been at times, just trying to be These things can only matter here if you have time Someone will call your name and then come to me, free These things can only happen once in a lifetime Of the things I think about, of situations that I can hear sometimes Someone will touch you softly and it will be me Free as the wind, free as the rain falling Free as the night, free as nature calling :We doing time   in the U SA We doing time   in the U SA Brothers  and my sisters My mothers and the children too Daddy  in the big wheel turnin'Rollin'  over you And I feel  like convict buddy Feel  like a ton of lead Runnin'  from the hounds in the moonlight Oh lord  let me catch my breath I wonna be free  like a big bird flyin'Free  like  the drivin' rain Free  like a hot sun shinin'Somebody's done clipped my wings I can't get no I can't get no Satisfaction  satisfaction No  kinda way Locked in -Good god you know I'm locked down Doin' time  in the U SA Doin' time  in the U SA
