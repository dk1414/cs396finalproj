bedroom window And the places you frequent, the chicks you freaked with The spot in the grass where you kept your stash Used to wonder to myself if you felt my eyes If you ever noticed me and knew I was alive Tried to draw your attention, wore dresses to my thighs With hopes to get close to you Used to dream about you right before I went to sleep Used to wake up on the morning hugging the sheets Used to practice what I'd say for the day that we'd meet Used to pray every day for the day that we'd meet Used to hang with your sis, if she only knew I only hung with that bitch to get closer to you Wasn't no limit to the things I would do To give all my love to you, my God Meshell Ndegéocello Play for me C'mon, talk to me Well, you know It never ceases to amaze me How everybody's always in
