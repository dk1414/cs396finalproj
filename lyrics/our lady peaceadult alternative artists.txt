Throw away the radio Suitcase that keeps you awake Hide the telephone, the telephone, telephone in case You realize that sometimes you're just not okay You level off, you level off, you level off But it's not alright now You need to understand There's nothing strange about this You need to know your friends You need to know that I'll be waving my hand Watching you drown Watching you scream Quiet or loud And maybe you should sleep And maybe you just need A friend as clumsy as you've been There's no one laughing You will be safe in here You will be safe in here Throw away this very old shoelace That tripped you again Try and shrug it off, shrug it off, shrug it off It's only skin now You need to understand There's nothing fake about this You need to let me in I'm watching you and.. Last time I talked to you You were lonely and out of place You were looking down on me Lost out in space We laid underneath the stars Strung out and feeling brave I watched the red orange glow I watched you float away Down here in the atmosphere Garbage and city lights You've gone to save your tired soul You've gone to save our lives I turned on the radio To find you on satellite I'm waiting for this sky to fall I'm waiting for a sign And all we are Is all so far You're falling back to me You're a star that I can see, yeah I know you're out there Somewhere out there You're falling out of reach Defying gravity, yeah I know you're out there Somewhere out thereDo you worry that you're not liked How long till you break You're happy cause you smile But how much can you fake An ordinary boy, an ordinary name But ordinary's just not good enough today No, a woo oo Ow, a woo oo Ow, a woo oo Alone x7 I'm thinking Why-eieieie yeah, is Superman dead Eieieie, yeah, is it in my head Eieieie, yeah, we'll just laugh instead You worry about the weather Whether not you should hate hate hate Are you worried about your faith Kneel down and obey You're happy you're in love You need someone to hate An ordinary girl, an ordinary waist But ordinary's just not good enough todayI walked around my good intentions And found that there were none I blame my father for the wasted years, we hardly talked I never thought I would forget this hate Then a phone call made me realize I'm wrong And if I don't make it known that I've loved you all along Just like sunny days that we ignore Because we're all dumb and jaded And, and I hope to God I figure out what's wrong I walked around my room not thinking Just sinking in this box I blame myself for being too much, like somebody else I never thought I would just bend this way Then a phone call made me realize I'm wrong And if I don't make it known that I've loved you all along Just like sunny days that we ignore Because we're all dumb and jaded And, and I hope to God I figure out what's wrong{Kickass Guitar solo}And I hope to God I figure out what's wrong And I hope to God I figure out what's wrongHow many times have you been pushed around Is anybody there Does anybody care And how many times have your friends let you down Is anybody there Did anybody stare Oh And how many times have your friends let you down Just open up your heart

Johnny wishes he was famous Spends his time alone in the basement With Lennon and Cobain and a guitar and a stereo And while he wishes he could escape this But it all seems so contagious Not to be yourself and faceless In a song that has no soul I remember feeling low I remember losing hope And I remember all the feelings And the day they stopped We are, we are all innocent We are all innocent, we are, we are all We are, we are all innocent We are all innocent, we are, we are all Tina's losing faith in what she knows Hates her music, hates all of her clothes Thinks of surgery and a new nose Every calorie's a war And while she wishes she was a dancer And that she'd never heard of cancer She wishes God would give her some answers And make her feel beautifulAnd Sara thinks she's died here once before She's crazy A pop-up book of flowers from grade 4 Are driving her insane No one knows why She's sad tonight No one can help her find Crying, Crying, she couldn't afford the view Crying, Crying, these automatic flowers won't do Another brick Another window frames the confusion Her garden blooms but Sarah can't see straight She's drinking herself blind And no one knows why She stares outside No one can help her fight Crying, Crying she couldn't afford the view Crying, Crying, these automatic flowers won't do These automatic flowers won't do She never admitted, she never considered That she always means better She's wasting all our time
