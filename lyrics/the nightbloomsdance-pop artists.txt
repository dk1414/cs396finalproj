When I look in the mirror He's standing behind me He's always there And he never gets older Time doesn't touch him See his face behind my shoulder He's dead for years There are times that he tries to Touch me but his hands are cold as ice and so He makes me shiver But still I like him See his face behind my sugar He's dead for years Every time when I turn off The light I hear him Whispering my name And then I ask him If he is still waiting See his face behind my soldier He's dead for years He's dead for yearsWhen I look in the mirror He's standing behind me He's always there And he never gets older Time doesn't touch him See his face behind my shoulder He's dead for years There are times that he tries to Touch me but his hands are cold as ice and so He makes me shiver But still I like him See his face behind my sugar He's dead for years Every time when I turn off The light I hear him Whispering my name And then I ask him If he is still waiting See his face behind my soldier He's dead for years He's dead for yearsWhen I look in the mirror He's standing behind me He's always there And he never gets older Time doesn't touch him See his face behind my shoulder He's dead for years
