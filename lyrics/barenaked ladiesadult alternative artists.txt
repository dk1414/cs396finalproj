It's been one week since you looked at me Cocked your head to the side and said, "I'm angry"Five days since you laughed at me, saying"Get back together, come back and see me"Three days since the living room I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you Yesterday, you'd forgiven me But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry Hold it now and watch the hoodwink As I make you stop, think You'll think you're looking at Aquaman I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes Big like Le Ann Rimes, because I'm all about value Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through Gonna make a break and take a fake I'd like a stinking aching shake I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know The vertigo is gonna grow'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiverOur whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly fourteen billion years ago, expansion started Wait...The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool Neanderthals developed tools We built a wall Math, science, history, unraveling the mystery That all started with the big bang Since the dawn of man is really not that long As every galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to sing this song A fraction of a second and the elements were made The bipeds stood up straight The dinosaurs all met their fate They tried to leap but they were late And they all died The oceans and Pangea See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya Set in motion by the same big bang It all started with the big bangIf I had a million dollars Well, I’d buy you a house And if I had a million dollars I’d buy you furniture for your house And if I had a million dollars Well, I’d buy you a K-Car And if I had a million dollars, I’d buy your love If I had a million dollars If I had a million dollars If I had a million dollars You know, we could just go up there and hang out Well, can you blame them It was a recipe for disaster A four-course meal of no sirree It seemed that happily ever after Was happy everyone was after me It was a cup of good intentions A tablespoon of one big mess A dash of overreaction I assume you know the rest One little slip, One little slip It was a fusion of confusion With a few confounding things I guess I probably took the wrong direction Well, I admit I might have missed a sign or two I ran a light past your affection At Humiliation Avenue Took a right turn at confusion A left when I should've gone straight on through I ran ahead with my assumptions We all know what that can doIt's the perfect time of year Somewhere far away from here I feel fine enough, I guess Considering everything's a mess There's a restaurant down the street Where hungry people like to eat I could walk, but I'll just drive It's colder than it looks outside It's like a dream you try to remember but it's gone then ya Try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn when ya Try to see the world beyond your front door Take your time because the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile when ya Realize that with a guy my size it might take a while just to Try to figure out what all this is for It's the perfect time of day To throw all your cares away Put the sprinkler on the lawn And run through with my gym shorts on Take a drink right from the hose And change into some drier clothes Climb the stairs up to my room Sleep away the afternoonDrove downtown in the rain Nine-thirty on a Tuesday night Just to check out the late-night record shop Call it impulsive, call it compulsive, call it insane But when I'm surrounded I just can't stop It's a matter of instinct, it's a matter of conditioning A matter of fact You can call me Pavlov's dog Ring a bell and I'll salivate How'd you like that Dr  Landy tell me you're not just a pedagogue Because right now I'm Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did Well I'm Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did So I'm lying here just staring at the ceiling tiles And I'm thinking about Oh, what to think about Just listening and re-listening to Smiley Smile And I'm wondering if this is some kind of creative drought Because I'mBroke into the old apartment This is where we used to live Broken glass, broke and hungry Broken hearts and broken bones This is where we used to live Why did you paint the walls Why did you clean the floor Why did you plaster over the hole I punched in the door This is where we used to live Why did you keep the mousetrap Why did you keep the dish rack These things used to be mine I guess they still are, I want 'em back Broke into the old apartment Forty-two steps from the street Crooked landing, crooked landlord Narrow laneway filled with crooks This is where we used to liveI met you before the fall of Rome And I begged you to let me take you home You were wrong, I was right You said goodbye, I said goodnight It's all been done It's all been done It's all been done before I knew you before the west was won And I heard you say the past was much more fun You go your way, I go mine But I'll see you next time It's all been done It's all been done It's all been done before And if I put my fingers here And if I say, "I love you, dear"And if I play the same three chords Will you just yawn and say'Ah, I hate it'When I was born, they looked at me and said"What a good boy, what a smart boy, what a strong boy"And when you were born, they looked at you and said"What a good girl, what a smart girl, what a pretty girl"We've got these chains hanging around our necks People want to strangle us with them Before we take our first breath Afraid of change, afraid of staying the same When temptation calls We just look away This name is the hair shirt I wear And this hair shirt is woven from your brown hair This song is the cross that I bear Bear with me, bear with me, bear with me Be with me tonight I know that it isn't right Be with me tonight I go to school, I write exams If I pass, if I fail, if I drop out Does anyone give a damn And if they do, they'll soon forget'Cause it won't take much for me To show my life ain't over yetI think It's getting to the point where I can be myself again It's getting to the point where we have almost made amends I think It's the getting to the point that is the hardest part And if you call, I will answer And if you fall, I'll pick you up And if you court this disaster I'll point you home I'll point you home You think I only think about you when we're both in the same room I'm only here to witness the remains of love exhumed You think We're here to play a game of who loves more than whom And if you call, I will answer And if you fall, I'll pick you up And if you court this disaster
