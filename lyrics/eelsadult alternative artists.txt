I need some sleep It can't go on like this I tried counting sheep But there's one I always miss Everyone says I'm getting down too low Everyone says, "You just got to let it go"You just got to let it go You just got to let it go I need some sleep Time to put the old horse down I'm in too deep And the wheels keep spinning 'round Everyone says I'm getting down too low Everyone says, "You just got to let it go"You just got to let it go You just got to let it go You just got to let it go You just got to let it go You just got to let it goLife is hard And so am I You'd better give me something So I don't die Novocaine for the soul Before I sputter out Before I sputter out Life is white And I am black Jesus and his lawyer Are coming back Oh, my darling Will you be here Before I sputter out Before I sputter out Before I sputter out Guess who's living here with the great undead This paint by numbers life is fucking with my head, once againMy beloved monster and me We go everywhere together Wearing a raincoat that has four sleeves Gets us through all kinds of weather She will always be the only thing That comes between me and the awful sting That comes from living in a world that's so damn mean My beloved monster is tough If she wants she will destroy you But if you lay her down for a kiss Her little heart it could explode She will always be the only thing That comes between me and the awful sting That comes from living in a world that's so damn mean La la la la la la la la La la la la la laThe deconstruction has begun Time for me to fall apart And if you think that it was rough I tell you nothing changes Till you start to break it down And break apart I'll break apart I'll break apart Right now it's going to start I'll break apart The reconstruction will begin Only when there's nothing left But little pieces on the floor They're made of what I was Before I had to break it down And break apart I'll break apart I'll break apart Right now it's going to start I'll break apartLaying on the bathroom floor Kitty licks my cheek once more And I, I could try But waking up is harder when you wanna die Walter's on the telephone Tell him I am not at home Cause I think that I Am going to a place where I am always high My name is Elizabeth My life is shit and pissThe smokestack spitting Black soot into the sooty sky The load on the road Brings a tear to the Indian's eye The elephant won't forget What it's like inside his cage The ringmaster's Telecaster Sings on an empty stage Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day Uh-huh The girl with the curls And the sweet pink ribbon in her hair She's crawlin' out her window'Cause her daddy, he just don't care Come on Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day Uh-huh"I'm not having any fun I'm not having any fun Friday, five sixteen P.M."And every time you crave for me, I'm here And anything you hunger for, I'll share And I will be quietly standing by While slowly I am dying inside Hold me in your arms And let me be the one Who can feel like I am a child In love Everytime I talk to you, you're down And every time you need a laugh, I'm around  And when you forget I'm here, I'm not It isn't really me that you forgot Hold me in your arms And let me be the one Who can feel like I am a child In love Whisper now And tell me how You watch me and tell me Somehow I'm gonna be alrightYou're dead but the world keeps spinning Take a spin through the world you left It's getting dark a little too early Are you missing the dearly bereft Taking flight and you could be here tomorrow Taking flight, well, you could get here tonight I'm gonna fly on down for the last stop to this town What I'm gonna fly on down then fly away Well, alright Get down Takin' a spin through the neighborhood The neighbors scream, "Whatchya talkin' bout "Cause they don't know how to let you in And I can't let you out What if I was not your only friend in this world Can you take me where you're going if you're never coming back I'm gonna fly on down for the last stop to this town I'm gonna fly on down then fly away on my way Get downI never thought that I could be so bold To even say these thoughts aloud I see you with your man Your eyes just shine While he stands tall And walking proud That look you give that guy I wanna see Looking right at me If I could be that guy Instead of me I'd never let you down It always seems like you're going somewhere Better than you've been before While I go to sleep and I dream all night Of you knocking at my door That look you give that guy I wanna see Looking right at me If I could be that guy Instead of me I'd be all I can beI can't look at the rocket launch The trophy wives of the astronauts And I won't listen to their words Cause I like Birds I don't care for walkin' downtown Crazy auto-car gonna mow me down Look at all the people like cows in a herd Well, I like Birds If you're small and on a search I've got a feeder for you to perch on I can't stand in line at the store The mean little people are such a bore But it's alright if you act like a turd Cause I like Birds If you're small and on a search I've got a feeder for you to perch on I've got a feeder for you to perch on If you're small and on a search I've got a feeder for you to perch on I've got a feeder for you to perch on
