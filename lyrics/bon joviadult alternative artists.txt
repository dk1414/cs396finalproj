Once upon a time, not so long ago Tommy used to work on the docks Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck It's tough So tough Gina works the diner all day Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay For love Mm, for love She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not We've got each other and that's a lot for love We'll give it a shot"Woah, we're halfway there Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer Tommy's got his six-string in hock Now he's holdin' in, when he used to make it talk So tough Ooh, it's tough Gina dreams of runnin' away When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers"Baby, it's okay Someday"This ain't a song for the broken-hearted No silent prayer for the faith-departed I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud It's my life, it's now or never I ain't gonna live forever I just want to live while I'm alive My heart is like an open highway Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"I just wanna live while I'm alive It's my life This is for the ones who stood their ground For Tommy and Gina who never backed down Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks It's my life, it's now or never I ain't gonna live forever I just want to live while I'm alive My heart is like an open highway Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"I just wanna live while I'm alive'Cause it's my lifeShot through the heart and you're to blame Darling, you give love a bad name An angel's smile is what you sell You promised me heaven, then put me through hell Chains of love got a hold on me When passion's a prison, you can't break free Woah, you're a loaded gun, yeah Oh, there's nowhere to run No one can save me, the damage is done Shot through the heart and you're to blame You give love a bad name I play my part and you play your game You give love a bad name Yeah, you give love a bad name Paint your smile on your lips Blood red nails on your fingertips A school boy's dream, you act so shy Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbyeThis Romeo is bleeding But you can't see his blood It's nothing but some feelings That this old dog kicked up It's been raining since you left me Now I'm drowning in the flood You see I've always been a fighter But without you I give up I can't sing a love song Like the way it's meant to be Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore But baby, that's just me And I will love you, baby, always And I'll be there forever and a day, always I'll be there till the stars don't shine Till the heavens burst and The words don't rhyme And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind And I'll love you, always Now your pictures that you left behind Are just memories of a different life Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry One that made you have to say goodbye What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair To touch your lips, to hold you near When you say your prayers try to understand I've made mistakes, I'm just a man When he holds you close, when he pulls you near When he says the words you've been needing to hear I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine To say to you 'till the end of timeIt's all the same, only the names will change Every day it seems we're wastin' away Another place where the faces are so cold I'd drive all night just to get back home I'm a cowboy On a steel horse I ride I'm wanted dead or alive Wanted dead or alive Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days The people I meet always go their separate ways Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink And times when you're alone, well, all you do is think I'm a cowboy On a steel horse I ride I'm wanted  dead or alive Wanted  dead or alive Oh, and I rideI guess this time you're really leavin'I heard your suitcase say goodbye Well as my broken heart lies bleedin'You say true love is suicide You say you've cried a thousand rivers And now you're swimmin' for the shore You left me drownin' in my tears And you won't save me anymore I'm prayin' to God you'll give me one more chance, girl I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for you I know you know we've had some good times Now they have their own hidin' place Well, I can promise you tomorrow But I can't buy back yesterday And, baby, you know my hands are dirty But I wanted to be your valentine I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby When you get drunk, I'll be the wineSitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know'Cause a bottle of Vodka is still lodged in my head And some blonde gave me nightmares I think that she's still in my bed As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead With an ironclad fist, I wake up and French kiss the morning While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking About all of the things that I long to believe About love and the truth and what you mean to me And the truth is baby you're all that I need I want to lay you down in a bed of roses For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails Oh I wanna be just as close as The Holy Ghost is And lay you down On a bed of roses Well I'm so far away, that each step that I take is on my way home A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night just to see through this payphone Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you I'll just close my eyes and whisper Baby, blind love is trueOn the street where you live girls talk about their social lives They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint, a touch of sable in their eyes All your life all you've asked when's your daddy gonna talk to you But you was living in another world trying to get your message through No one heard a single word you said They should have seen it in your eyes What was going around your head Ooh, she's a little runaway Daddy's girl learned fast All those things she couldn't say Ooh, she's a little runaway Take a line every night guaranteed to blow your mind I see you out on the streets, calling for a wild time So you sit home alone cause there's nothing left that you can do There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you You know she likes the lights at nights on the neon Broadway signs She don't really mind, it's only love she hoped to find Ooh, she's a little runaway Daddy's girl learned fast All those things she couldn't say Ooh, she's a little runawayI wake up in the morning and I raise my weary head I've got an old coat for a pillow, and the earth was last night's bed I don't know where I'm goin', only God knows where I've been I'm a devil on the run, a six gun lover, a candle in the wind When you're brought into this world, they say you're born in sin Well, at least they gave me somethin', I didn't have to steal or have to win Well, they tell me that I'm wanted, yeah, I'm a wanted man I'm a colt in your stable, I'm what Cain was to Abel, Mr  Catch-Me-If-You-Can I'm goin' down in a blaze of glory Take me now but know the truth I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory And, Lord, I never drew first, but I drew first blood I'm no one's son, call me young gun You ask about my conscience and I offer you my soul You ask If I'll grow to be a wise man, well I ask if I'll grow old You ask me if I've known love and what it's like to sing songs in the rain Well, I've seen love come, I've seen it shot down, I've seen it die in vain Shot down in a blaze of glory Take me now but know the truth'Cause I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood I'm the devil's son, call me young gunThis is an open letter From you and me together Tomorrow's in our hands now Find the words that matter Say them out loud And make it better somehow Looking down from up on the moon It's a tiny blue marble Who would've thought the ground we stand on Could be so fragile This is a love song to the Earth You're no ordinary world A diamond in the universe Heaven's poetry to us Keep it safe, keep it safe, keep it safe Cause it's our world, it's our world It's not about possessions Money, or religion How many years we might live When the only real question that matters Is still a matter of perspective
