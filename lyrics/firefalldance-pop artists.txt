When it all goes crazy and the thrill is gone The days get rainy and the nights get long When you get that feelin' you were born to lose Staring at your ceiling thinkin' of your blues When there's so much trouble that you wanna cry The world has crumbled and you don't know why When your hopes are fading and they can't be found Dreams have left you waiting, friends have let you down Just remember I love you And it'll be alright Just remember I love you More than I can say Maybe then your blues will fade away When you need a lover and you're down so low Start to wonder, but you never know When it feels like sorrow is your only friend Knowing that tomorrow you'll feel this way again When the blues come callin' at the break of dawn Rain keeps fallin', but the rainbow's gone When you feel like crying but the tears won't come When your dreams are dyin', when you're on the runYou are the woman that I've always dreamed of I knew it from the start I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart It's not so much the things you say to me It's not the things you do It's how I feel each time you're close to me That keeps me close to you Whoa oh You are the woman that I've always dreamed of I knew it from the start I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart It's not so much your pretty face I see It's not the clothes you wear It's more that special way you look at me That always keeps me there Whoa oh whoa You are the woman that I've always dreamed of I knew it from the start I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heartDidn't I hear you cry this morning, didn't I feel you weep Teardrops flowin' down on me, like rivers in my sleep And in my dream of laughter, you came creepin' with your fears Telling me your sorrows, in the tracings of your tears That's a strange way to tell me you love me When your sorrow is all I can see If you just want to cry to somebody, don't cry to me, no Don't cry to me, no Didn't I hear your voice this morning, didn't you call my name I heard you whisper softly, but the words were never plain And in your dream of darkness, I came shinin' like the sun Waiting for the laughter, but the laughter never comes That's a strange way to tell me you love me When your sorrow is all I can see If you just want to cry to somebody, dont cry to me, no Dont cry to me, no Didn't you feel alone this morning, didn't you need a friend And in your darkest hour, you came runnin' back againClose your weary eyes and drift away, it's all right I'll be here until the break of day brings the light I can sing a lullaby they sang for me when I was just your size Just a little poem with a melody to shut those sleepy eyes Singing dolphins over the ocean Where it's clear and it's deep Help the waves with your gentle motion Rock this child to sleep May sailing ships and secrets fill your dreams with delight Anything you want is yours for free for the night I won't let no bad dreams come and bother you Just put your trust and me I'll be standing by to keep a watch on you While you're away at sea Singing dolphins over the ocean Where it's clear and it's deep Help the waves with your gentle motion Rock this child to sleep You got to rock this child You got to rock this child to sleep You got to rock-a-bye my baby Rock-a-bye my baby, rock-a-byeMaybe you think I'm letting you go Maybe it's not that way Maybe I love you more than you know Maybe you'll know someday Maybe you think it's easy for me Easy to say Goodbye Maybe it hurts me more than you see All I can do is cry But love is not enought to make you mine You need someone who's gonna be there all the time Someone to treat you better Someone to see you through Someone who'd never say Goodbye, I love you Goodbye, I love you Goodbye, I love you Goodbye, I love you You need a man who's always around Whenever you feel alone You need a man who won't let you down You need your man at home You need the time to ltet yourself live You haven't lived enough You need the one thing I cannot give You need the time to loveShe was just lookin'Wonderin' if you might notice her smile She was just watchin'Hopin' you might want to stay for a while Let her be by your side You don't have to say why You don't have to say why It doesn't matter She was just lookin' at you Standing alone while she tells you goodbye She still wishes you'd stay Wanting to tell you the way that she feels She can't think what to say Except don't walk away You might need her some day You might need her some day It doesn't matter She was just lookin' at you She was just watchin'As you walked away without turnin' around She was jut cryin'Her head in her hands and her eyes on the ground Without making a sound Oh but don't turn around Leave her behind She'll be around If you change your mind babyWhen it all goes crazy and the thrill is gone The days get rainy and the nights get long When you get that feelin' you were born to lose Staring at your ceiling thinkin' of your blues
