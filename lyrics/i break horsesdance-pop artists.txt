salvation But can you save my life You've run out of light And out of sight I've run out of time We're running out Running on a suicide Oh you run so slowly but straight into the light You're my sweet death angel Running on a suicide Time moves so slowly When I scream into the nightHoney I don't mind running blind You keep pushing on to get inside my mind Don't care what you find Inside I'm upside down I wish I could get out in time You keep pushing on to get inside my mind Tell me how it feels now that you've made it in I'll be the death of you Yeah I'll be the death of youYou shot the beauty right in its broken eye You tattooed an anchor even though you're bound to fly You invited the devil and the Jesus Christ Baby you have travelled for miles without love in your eyes You've cut some corners and you've bruised some eyes With the perfect needle you've got someone to crucify As you poison your veins nobody's gonna hear you cry Baby you have travelled for miles without love in your eyes Baby you have travelled for miles without love in your eyesI often tremble with the truth I'm almost always out of use When I see the day I see like no one else I live at night'Cause I'm afraid Of the dayYou dream about making love Against the wall But there's never really room to make Love at all We hold on to our dreams Our broken dreams To keep our promises At heart, we're a broken team I'm rushing with your blood To temper your obsession But in the end I'm just A tourist in your depression You dream about making war Against the world There's never really love enoughI know you love me and that you heard me My mind is made up This time I am certain I will escape your so-called affection And walk out on your semi erection You're wasting my time and my future I let you win this time my soon to be a loser I will escape your so-called affection'Cause baby we're fucking with absent minds While our hearts are breaking Turn I can't turn love around And I'm losing my mind Turn Or let me follow you down I know you love me and that you hurt me My mind is blinded by the passion we grounded But I will escape your ghost with affection And walk
