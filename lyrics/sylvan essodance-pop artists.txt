True, it's a dance, we know the moves The bow, the dip, the woo Though the words are true The state is old news Wrap me in your arms I can’t feel it but Rock me in your arms I can't feel it but Get up, get down Get up, get down Feel the turn of rotation and stop See the next one waiting Get up, get down Get up, get down Get up Sentiment's the same but the pair of feet change I know my words will dry upon the skin Just like a name I remember hearingGive me a new single Make me a new baby Gonna eat all the candy while you straddle and lay me Gonna know all the words before you come on top And I sing them back at you while you try to nap While the world riots on, we're so happy to be listening to our radio Our saviour, oh While the world melts on down we're so happy to be listening to our radio Now break it on down slow Slave to the radio, slave to the radio, slave to the radio3.30 Slave to the radio, slave to the radio, slave to the radio3.30 Now don't you look good sucking American dick You're so surprised they like you You're so cute and so quick Singing I've got the moves of a tv queen Folk girl hero in a magazine Faking the truth in a new pop song Don't you wanna sing alongI had it all planned out before you met me Was gonna leave early and so swiftly Maybe in a fire or crash off a ravine People would weep, "How tragic, so early"I was gonna die young Now I gotta wait for you, honey Now I gotta wait for you, honey Now I gotta wait for you, honey I was a firecracker, baby, with something to prove Now I gotta contend with the living blues I could've missed it, I never knew Chain reaction but you're holding the fuse I was gonna die young Now I gotta wait for you, honey Now I gotta wait for you, honey Now I gotta wait for you, honey Oh, I don't mind I got the fire Electric light So high, so wild It's not like I chose Not like I tried But now I gotta wait around and watch you burn so bright I was gonna dieHey mami, I know what you want, mami Hey mami, I know what you want, mami Hey mami, I know what you want, mami Hey mami, I know what you want, mami Hey mami, I know what you want, mami Hey mami, I know what you want, mami She walking so fast, she walking so fast, she walking so fast Oh our lady she don't know how she’s growing She walking so fast, she walking so fast, she walking like a babe, hey Her image it lasts and I know She floats along as she goes She owns the eyes as she flies right through the sound Moving her body all around town Hey, hey mami, hey, hey mami I know what you want, I know what you want, I know what you want Sooner or later the dudes at bodegas will hold their lips and own their shit Comin' to terms on a chivalry tip But our hero, she don't know the gravity she holds As she pulls on the eyeballs of all the kids standing tall Hey mami, I know what you want, mami Hey mami, I know what you want, mami Hey mami, I know what you want, mami Hey mami, I know what you want, mamiI'm washing With all my friends In the kitchen Drying dishes Turning twisting Until we can run out Going swimming I feel you behind me Ringing bowls right next to my ear Tone was so clear So that we all could hear When the water washed around us salty Holding us dear Did you ever say it Oh no Did you ever say it No, no, no, no Skinny skinny skinny man With a whale to hold his hand Oh to trade the places fast To be swallowed Let it last Let it last Let it last Let it lastI got all the parts I wished for I've got everything I need Sometimes I'm above water But mostly I'm at sea Oh, slack jawed me Can't you see There's so many rhythms and harmonies And I'm walking the dog back It's not like I got hurt or broken Or ruined on the way It's an ache and it shines through me A swallow in a cage Oh, slack jawed me Can't you see There's so many rhythms and harmonies And I'm walking the dog back Is it a sign  Or just a landmine Or a feeling roaming free It's overtaken me Gonna hold it 'til it dries up Or pocket it for another day If it's me I cannot give up I'd rather that she stayedSpeedy, speedy, slow down time Gas station is running dry Mm-mm, eh-eh, mm-mm Sweaty, sweaty, wonder why Now it's always summertime Mm-mm, eh-eh, mm-mm It's all gone, but here we're gonna stay Anyway, the concrete's all empty So we're makin' a parade It goes left, nothing there It goes right, watch your step It goes left, don't look down It goes right, look straight ahead Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead Maybe there's some food up there P-A-R-A-D with me Yeah, there's nothing left to ruin, yeah, we finally got free How's that for manifesting our destiny P-A-R-A-D with me Salty, salty water dried Oceans all gone with the tide Mm-mm, eh-eh, mm-mm Steamy, steamy, bright sunshine Flowers, grass, and trees all died Mm-mm, eh-eh, mm-mmAugust in the heat, sweaty in the street Tilt-a-whirling I can feel your eyes find me in the crowd Think you like me now I've been seeing you every day On my block in your white tee You're looking pretty fine to me So why are you waiting When I'm slamming in my dancing shoes Asphalt's hot, and my knees all bruised It's the summer, got a lot to prove Can't wait to do it, can you  Oh, I'm swaying from side to side In the neon lights Sainted halo, underworld goth vibes You'll do fine for tonight Take me, take me, me ferris wheeling, babe It's the air I crave When we're up so high, salty wind at night Make out mountain time I'm covered in soot We’re running for gondolas And when I come home again my arms will wrap around my friends When I come home again my arms will wrap around my friends I'm covered in soot I'm covered in skin And when I go to leave again I’ll wear the clothes you put me in And when I go to leave again I'll wear the clothes you put me in Could I be coming home with the waves rolling back Could I be coming home with the waves rolling back Could I be coming home with the waves rolling back Could I be coming home with the waves rolling back Oh why Oh why did I go outside with the bitches on the trail Oh why Oh why did I go I don't know Only thing I can think to say is Get on the train, get on the train And ride it 'til you come, ride it 'til you come Get on the train, get on the train And ride it 'til you come, ride it 'til you comeThe modern wolf He's kinder But see him weep It's a reminder Don't wear no suit We're talking t-shirts See how he glides Makes women shiver Ah-woo Ah-woo He ain't no Jack His voice is smoother Been bending notes Just like his father Ah-woo Ah-woo But no birds or beast does he eat He only wants the tenderest meat And oh the sounds he makes them speak Under all different patterns of sheets
