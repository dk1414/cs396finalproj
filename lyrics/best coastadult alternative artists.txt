worse Than sitting all alone at home And waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting Waiting by the phone I hope that he's at home waiting by his phone I wonder if he knows that I want him I wish he was my boyfriend I wish he was my boyfriend I'd love him 'til the very end But instead he is just a friend I wish he was my boyfriend The other girl is not like me She's prettier and skinnier She has a college degree I dropped out when I was seventeen If I could only get her out of the picture Then he would know how much I want himMy highs are high, my lows are low And I don't know which way to go Every time you leave this house Everything falls apart I can't get myself off the couch I don't wanna talk to anyone else Every time you leave this house Everything falls apart I lost my job, I miss

how I feel I don't know how I feel I don't know how I feel And nothing makes me happy Not even T V or a bunch of weed Every time you leave this house Everything falls apartWake up, you know I feel ok Go to sleep, it's just another day I know, someday I'll find it Where I, I least expect it My doctor says that I should take it At least I won't have to keep faking I know, someday I'll find it Where I, I least expect it Today I know I feel ok Baby look at me with those eyes of grey But I'll keep trying to stay this way I know it's love that's got me feeling ok I took my own advice for once I gave it up, I gave it up I know someday I'll find it Where I, I least expect it Today I know I feel ok Baby look at me with those eyes of grey When I get down, I get so down But I'll keep trying to stay this way I know it's love got me feeling ok Feeling ok Feeling ok Feeling ok Feeling okTrying really hard, I'm trying harder than I ever have before Used to think that taking care of myself would just become a real bore On Friday nights I don't spend too much time lying on the bathroom floor Like I used to The demons deep inside of me They might have finally been set free And I guess this is what they mean when they say People can change'Cause I finally feel free I feel like myself again But for the first time I changed the color of the bed sheets Now they are a pretty pale pink Traded her in for a new girl And she's looking pretty fine But sometimes she don't listen to me And it makes me wanna lose my mind Like you used to I tried to blame it all on you But I know that I'm to blame tooI just wanna tell you That I've always loved you I just wanna tell you That I've always loved you I just wanna tell you That I've always missed you I just wanna tell you That I've always missed you When the sun don't shine You aren't mine When the sun don't shine You aren't mine Mine MineI walked to the bottom of my block and thought About how you, how you How you'd be home soon, how you How you'd be home soon Last night I went out with this guy This guy, he was nice He was nice and cute but he He wasn't you You say that we're just friends But I want this till the end You say that we're just friends But I want this till the end The end, till the end The end, till the end The end, till the end The end, till the end Ooh Ooh
