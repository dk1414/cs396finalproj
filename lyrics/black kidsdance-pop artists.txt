You are the girl that I've been dreamin' of Ever since I was a little girl You are the girl that I've been dreamin' of Ever since I was a little girl One: I'm bitin' my tongue Two: He's kissin' on you Three: Oh, why can't you see One, two, three, four!The word's on the streets and it's on the news I'm not gonna teach him how to dance with you He's got two left feet and he bites my moves I'm not gonna teach him how to dance, dance, dance, dance The second I do, I know we're gonna be through I'm not gonna teach him how to dance with you He don't suspect a thing, I wish he'd get a clue I'm not gonna teach him how to dance, dance, dance, dance You are the girl that I've been dreamin' of Ever since I was a little girl You are the girl that I've been dreamin' of Ever since, ever sinceJane, I've made it plain Although I'm faded as a ghost I want you here inside me Say the word Oh, you've been playing nice But I can see it in your eyes You're thinking, "Christ He's everybody's girl."You can't spend the night Jane, I've seen you at the club You were tearin' up the rug With no regard for form You're such a brute!You had a ready elbow For the girls you hate Or just don't know You head-butt me Cos you thought it was cute You can't spend the night Yes, I'm sure you're right You can't spend the night Yeah, I'm sure you're right You can't spend the night Yes, I'm sure you're right But we could spend the night together Or alone, that would be betterSo you want my affection We both know you'll only throw it away But if you must have a go, fine, okay If you must have a go, then go away I'm making eyes at you I've been making these eyes now, making these eyes since '82 I've been making them green and grey and brown and delta blues I'm reciting a mantra but I can't tell you 'cause you're missing to me That's all you'll ever be Oh please don't, please don't speak You'll kill the mystique Oh baby let's not, let's not dance We'll ruin our chances Oh, in between the drinks I can't help but think that Even as we speak We kill the mystique You are missing to me And I am missing much Your sleepy panda eyes, those dangerous thighs, your dirty touch You are the wildest one But you're the one that I want I'm making eyes at you That's all I ever doI don't want to fight anymore Just take my hand Please, tell me everything, my love I'll understand If it is wrong Then let's be damned I hate to tell you in a song that I love you I hate to tell you in some song that I love you Heart and soul I just don't know If I give everything I have Will you not go How could I bare to No, I won't share you I hate to tell you in a song that I love you I hate to tell you in some song that I love you You're right Too right You've shown me, and I can't deny You're right Too right Forever on your sideIt’s always the same You’re more fickle than the weather First, it’s “Babe, I need my space”And then it’s “Wait, let’s stay together”You declare a thumb war Drag me to the dance floor Any excuse to touch me This feels like a rerun Let me guess, when we’re done I’m the one left wondering If my heart is broken Wouldn’t it stop working Shouldn’t it stop hurting Oh baby, I’m just smirking through the pain If my heart is broken Couldn’t it stop jerking me around I wanna know—can this last forever Night after night, our hearts Are beating out of rhythm Would that I could I’d speak the spell But it’s no good If you won’t listen There isn’t a dive bar That isn’t on your radar We both know you’ll find me Is this mirror broken After all is spoken It makes us feel so uglyI'm having a motherfuckin' party at my motherfuckin' house Are you in or are you out Are you in or are you out Are you in  Or out In  Or out In  Or out In  Or out  Are you in Of course you're in Ask a silly question, I know, I know I'm having a motherfuckin' party at my motherfuckin' house Are you in or are you out Are you in or are you out Are you in  Or out In  Or out In  Or out In  Or out  Are you in I mean do you even love me Be there We've got obligatory drugs All the songs you love All the kiss and hugs All of the above Are you in  Or out In  Or Out In  Or Out Are you in Your mama don't know nothing 'bout this Magic and technology in a kiss Feels like we share some secret Like we share this cigarette I feel it coming over me I feel you taking over me You took my body You took my body x2 Well, baby, you don't want my love It's too I FF YTell me what you're thinking of When you're with me I-F-F-Y, it's too iffy I-F-F-Y, are you with me Love causes so much pain And I've got so much love to give Love causes so much pain And I've got so much love to give I feel it coming over me I feel you taking over me You took my body You took my bodyOver and over, baby Making me play this game If true love waits, it's a big mistake No need to feel ashamed When the clock says stop we're all gonna drop I don't care if we get caught When the clock says stop we're all gonna drop I don't care what you've been taught I say baby, you say bump it All you wanna hear is Gabriel's trumpet Clock says stop we're all gonna drop All gonna drop, all gonna drop If half of what they say is true Look at me when I rock with you If half of what they say is true Look at me when I rock with you Sure I know it's apocalypse But can't it wait till I kiss your lips If half of what they say is true Look at me when I rock with you baby You make me feel so helpless I meet you after school I'm so tired of kissing, shooting and missing Making me feel a foolLike many a Mael I get angst in my pants And goddamn it to hell It don't help if I dance And you, you're not doing too well All the blogs are about you, girl They caught you in the park after dark Giving head to a statue, girl Oh, cruel  x2 Didn't mean to do you no harm I just underestimated my charm And if I ever bother to tell you the truth Oh, baby, you're too much sugar For my sweet tooth You're on your honeymoon And you're sending me notes You hope to see me soon You've got "see" wrapped In quotes I used to find it funny to say"What's your man got to do with me "But then I saw him downtown Placing bets on the hounds He was as big as a house!We can't be messin' around Everything's been grand since you left the crypt All the kids are sporting cemetery lips And they know That you're a mess of all that is classic You're the worst of all that is magic You're the reason I don't love anything Oh, ring ring You only call me when you're crying You only need me when he leaves You won't confess unless you're dying You only kiss on New Year's Eve You only want me when I'm taken You only kick me when I'm down You only call me when you're crying Oh, but it's such a lovely sound Honest question - how we gonna knock these boots You can only make it if it's under the fuse Yeah, me too Mama tells me that you are thoughtless Papa tells me love gets monotonous They're the reasons I do whatever you say Yeah, okay
