Ah, ah, ah Ah...I'm the boy in your other phone Lighting up inside your drawer at home, all alone Pushing 40 in the friend zone We talk and then you walk away, every day Oh, you don't think twice 'bout me And maybe you're right to doubt me, but But if you give me just one night You're gonna see me in a new light Yeah, if you give me just one night To meet you underneath the moonlight Oh, I want a take two, I want to break through I wanna know the real thing about you So I can see you in a new light Take a ride up to Malibu I just wanna sit and look at you, look at you What would it matter if your friends knew Who cares what other people say, anyway Oh, we can go far from here And make a new world together, babeGravity is working against me And gravity wants to bring me down Oh, I'll never know What makes this man, with all the love that his heart can stand Dream of ways to throw it all away Woah, woah Gravity is working against me And gravity wants to bring me down Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good And can't sustain like one half could It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good And can't sustain like one half could It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my kneesIt's not a silly little moment It's not the storm before the calm This is the deep and dying breath of This love that we've been working on Can't seem to hold you like I want to So I can feel you in my arms Nobody's going to come and save you We pulled too many false alarms We're going down And you can see it, too We're going down And you know that we're doomed My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room I was the one you always dreamed of You were the one I tried to draw How dare you say it's nothing to me Baby, you're the only light I ever saw I'll make the most of all the sadness You'll be a bitch, because you can You try to hit me, just to hurt me So you leave me feeling dirty'Cause you can't understandShe's a good girl, loves her mama Loves Jesus and America too She's a good girl, crazy about Elvis Loves horses and her boyfriend too Yeah, yeah It's a long day living in Reseda There's a freeway running through the yard I'm a bad boy 'cause I don't even miss her I'm a bad boy for breaking her heart And I'm free Free fallin', fallin'And I'm free Free fallin', fallin'All the vampires walking through the valley They move west down Ventura Boulevard And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows And the good girls are home with broken hearts And I'm free Free fallin', fallin'Now I'm free Free fallin', fallin'How much of my mother has my mother left in me How much of my love will be insane to some degree And what about this feeling that I'm never good enough Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood How much of my father am I destined to become Will I dim the lights inside me just to satisfy someone Will I let this woman kill me, or do away with jealous love Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood I can feel the love I want I can feel the love I need But it's never gonna come the way I am Could I change it if I wanted Can I rise above the flood Will it wash out in the water Or is it always in the blood How much like my brothers do my brothers wanna be Does a broken home become another broken family Or will we be there for each other like nobody ever could Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood I know a girl She puts the color inside of my world But she's just like a maze Where all of the walls all continually change And I've done all I can To stand on the steps with my heart in my hand Now I'm starting to see Maybe it's got nothing to do with me Fathers, be good to your daughters Daughters will love like you do Girls become lovers who turn into mothers So mothers, be good to your daughters too Oh, you see that skin It's the same she's been standing in Since the day she saw him walking away Now she's left Cleaning up the mess he made So fathers, be good to your daughters Daughters will love like you do Girls become lovers who turn into mothers So mothers, be good to your daughters tooPaper doll, come try it on Step out of

those who lead it We just feel like we don't have the means To rise above and beat it So we keep waiting Waiting on the world to change We keep on waiting Waiting on the world to change It's hard to beat the system When we're standing at a distance So we keep waiting Waiting on the world to change Now if we had the power To bring our neighbors home from war They would have never missed a
