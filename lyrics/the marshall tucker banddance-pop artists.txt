Gonna take a freight train Down at the station, Lord I don't care where it goes Gonna climb a mountain The highest mountain Jump off, nobody gonna know Can't you see, whoa, can't you see What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me Can't you see, can't you see What that woman, she been doin' to me I'm gonna find me A hole in the wall I'm gonna crawl inside and die'Cause my lady, now A mean ol' woman, Lord Never told me goodbye Can't you see, whoa, can't you see What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me Can't you see, can't you see What that woman, she been doin' to meTook my family away from my Carolina home Had dreams about the West and started to roam Six long months on a dust covered trail They say heaven's at the end but so far it's been hell And there's fire on the mountain, lightning in the air Gold in them hills and it's waiting for me there We were digging and sifting from five to five Selling everything we found just to stay alive Gold flowed free like the whiskey in the bars Sinning was the big thing, lord and Satan was his star And there's fire on the mountain Lightning in the air Gold in them hills and it's waiting for me there Dance hall girls were the evening treat Empty cartridges and blood lined the gutters of the street Men were shot down for the sake of fun Or just to hear the noise of their forty-four gunsI ain't never been with a woman long enough for my boots to get old We've been together so long now they both need re-soled If I ever settle down you'd be my kind And it's a good time for me to head on down the line Heard it in a love song Heard it in a love song Heard it in a love song Can't be wrong I'm the kind of man who likes to get away Like to start dreaming 'bout tomorrow today Never said that I love you even though it's so Where's that duffel bag of mine, it's time to go Heard it in a love song Heard it in a love song Heard it in a love song Can't be wrongLord I've always been a drifter Seems like I was always passing through I never met anybody or anything I just had to come back to you But the minute I saw you All my dreams were standing alive And I would gladly give a hundred of my tomorrows If I could see you just one more time If I could see you one more time There's just a few things on my mind Just a few more things I'd like to tell ya If I could see you just one more time As I travel down the highway Got to be the gypsy in my bones But all I do is see your smiling face Makes a man feel so alone But you've already captured my soul And slowly you're invading my mind And I would gladly give a hundred of my tomorrows If I could see you just one more time If I could see you one more time There's just a few things on my mind Just a few more things I'd like to tell ya If I could see you just one more timeI rode into town today And in my mind I said "Lord, I'd love to stay"Something in me said "Boy, move on"Don't know what it is the good Lord bred it in my bones And I'm searchin' for a rainbow And if the wind ever shows me where to go You'll be waitin' at the end then I'll know I'll say, "To Hell with that pot of gold"I'll say, "To Hell with that pot of gold"This old mare I'm ridin' she's gettin' kinda tired But in my heart she knows there's this one desire She's gonna take me to the end of our road Then she'll lay down and die and I'll say, "God rest her soul"And I'm searchin' for a rainbow And if the wind ever shows me where to go You'll be waitin' at the end then I'll know I'll say, "To Hell with that pot of gold"I'll say, "To Hell with that pot of gold"Well I'm ridin' along Singin' the same ol' cowboy song That's been sung a hundred times before Ain't got nothin' but my name And I'm the only man I know to blame But I'm livin', I'm happy and I'm free Just listen to the wind blow Let it blow, let it blow sand over my trail I got my saddle on the ground And that ol' moon, he can still be found Hidin' in the desert sky I like simple things in life like a prairie breeze A good stout horse between my knees Just bein' alone, just bein' me And when I die let me die with a dream in my mind A smile on my face and no trouble behind And no cross on my grave to show my restin' place So I can listen to the wind blow Let it blow, let it blow sand over my trail I got my saddle on the ground And that ol' moon, he can still be found Hidin' in the desert skyI can't imagine how the world would be Not to see the gray squirrel climbing in an oak tree To walk through a corn field and not see the wild duck flyin'I believe before the world ever got that bad I'd be on my knees a-cryin'Won't you fly, oh eagle fly You better run, little cottontail, run I hope you both live long enough to see the setting sun The lion ain't got no jungle Old black bear got no cave And that poor old alligator He just 'bout seen his better days Won't you fly, oh eagle fly You better run, little cottontail, run I hope you both live long enough to see the setting sun On a cold winter morning I could look up in the sky And I could see the wild geese fly And on a warm spring day I could look up in the air And I could see the yellow butterfly How long has it been since you heard the tiny flutter Of the little wing of a hummingbird And I once saw the picture of a buffalo A thousand in the herdWell I'm sittin' down in San Anton'Waiting on an eight o'clock train My woman left me here last night Things ain't been quite the same I gotta get back to Dallas And tie up a few loose ends I'm gonna work a week make a hundred dollars Aw and hit the road again So I don't want you to think That you're the first one To leave me out here on my own'Cause this ain't gonna be the first time This ol' cowboy spent the night alone Well honey I've been a fool, but a bigger fool I can't remember when I've been Just to open up my heart And let you walk right in But there's one thing in life That ain't hard for me to do That's as soon as I kiss the lips of another woman I'm gonna forget all about youTake the highway Lord knows I've been gone too long Lot of sad days One day you'll turn around and I'll be gone And the time has finally come For me to pack my bags and walk away Hear me say I'll be back someday But darlin' please don't wait for me too long There's just one place I can't stay Memories of your love still lingers on And the time has finally come For me to pack my bags and walk away Hear me say I'll be back someday But darlin' please don't wait for me too long There's just one place I can't stay Memories of your love still lingers on And the time has finally come For me to pack my bags and walk away Hear me sayI been down around Houston,Texas Where the sun shines most of the time I been drivin' about six hours Tryin' to reach that Arkansas line But Texarkana's an hour ahead And I got to keep my wheels rolling But woman you're always on my mind Twenty-four hours at a time Somehow woman I'm hopin' you feel the same way Woman you know that I miss you And I can't miss you no more I got this White doing seventy miles an hour She's loaded, she's down to the floor'Cause I got to reach that Arkansas line Before the sun goes down, yeah But woman you're always on my mind Twenty-four hours at a time Somehow woman I'm hopin' you feel the same way
