Cheated and lied, broken so bad You made a vow, never get mad You play the game, though it's unfair They're all the same, who can compare First you lose trust, then you get worried Night after night, bar after club Dropping like flies, who woke you up On the front lawn, sprinklers turn on It's not your house, where'd you go wrong First you get hurt, then you feel sorry Flying like a cannonball, falling to the Earth Heavy as a feather when you hit the dirt How am I the lucky one I do not deserve to wait around forever when you were there first First you get hurt, then you feel sorry There comes a time, in a short life Turn it around, get a re-write Call it a dark night of the soul Ticking of clocks, gravity's pull First you get close, then you get worriedAnd when my heart won't break An empty space between my lungs And when my knees won't shake I'll drink to find inspiration'Cause I'm a red blooded man When I can't see behind the sun A supernatural plan Is coming to meet me now Living life with no need for the brakes Something happens when I lean on my mistakes Love is mystical Love will break the chains You might feel invincible And you might be afraid Light in darkness will show you the way Give you the power to believe again'Cause I'm a rational man And I can see how far I've come But I don't know where to stand Or who's coming to meet me nowPeople wonder, people talk We're supposed to settle down How we ever got this far Without our feet touching the ground What time is it now where you are We follow beats with different drums We're looking at the same star It is a talent staying young So why you think we both Run around in circles Walk through fire Nothing hurts us Every mountain you climb takes you further away Overcome a lifetime, every day No, we can't help it We're always restless Now you're wired then you're tired There is never a break You only come alive at the thrill of the chase No, we can't help it We're always restlessI've come here nine times asking you, do not make it ten I'm peelin' off all the armor that protected my skin Apologize, I'm layin' down my ego to rest Could you be mine forever, just in case it exists I think about the old days What we've been through to survive Do we get better with time Tell me I'm wrong Looking back to the start, who we were when we met This box of pictures tells a story, when we fight, we forget And I can barely recognize us, back then we were obsessed Can we cut out this madness and get back to the best Think about the old days What we've been through to survive Do we get better with time Tell me I'm wrong I'm lookin' to you always We follow the same guiding light Passin' like ships in the night Can we hang on Can we hang on I kissed the kids at noon Then stumbled out the room I caught a cab, ran up a tab on Seventh and Flowers Beth's recital, I had to run Missed my son's graduation Punched the Nichols boy for taking his seat He gets all that anger from me Still things could be much worse Natural disasters On the evening news Still things could be much worse We've still got our health My paycheck in the mail I promised to my wife and children I'd never touch another drink as long as I live But even then, it sounds so soothing This will blow over in time This will all blow over in time I'm just an honest man Provide for me and mine I give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations Two weeks paid vacation Won't heal the damage done I need another oneYou can't cut me loose until you show me I told you the truth about the old me And now you use confession as the proof Do what you have to do Go ahead and act the fool What if in the end You want so bad to forgive But you cannot forget So We've been here before I'm so You want something more Lover, best friend, my worst enemy You know I won't let you get away I get you to swerve out of the fast lane You still got champagne running through your veins You dare me to step up and challenge you Neither one of us can stand to lose Stand to loseCareless in our summer clothes splashing around In the muck and the mire Careless in our summer clothes splashing around In the muck and the mire Fell asleep with stains Caked deep in the knees What a pain Now hang me up to dry You wrung me out Too, too, too many times Now hang me up to dry I'm pearly like the white The whites of your eyes All mixed up in the wash Hot water bleeding our colors All mixed up in the wash Hot water bleeding our colors Now hang me up to dry You wrung me out Too, too, too many times Now hang me up to dry I'm pearly like the white The whites of your eyesI've been silent partner, I've been your shrink I have heard your sad luck misfortune speech But I'll have sympathy when you get off your seat Before this bitterness becomes a disease I have cracked the code on this old machine Ten thousands hours to be released But I've been wondering why can't you see If the door opens up, then go where it leads And I have been waiting For you to find That all of this could be yours Be yours tonight Could be yours Could be yours Could be yours Could be yours Could be yours Could be yours Could be yoursI was supposed to do great things I know the road was long But I wasn't raised to shoot for fame I had the safety on I cut my ties, I sold my rings I wanted none of this If you start from scratch you have to sing Just for the fun of it I’d be alright, if I could just see you Come up for air, come up for air A miracle mile, where does it lead to Come up for air, come up for air I feel the air upon my face Forget the mess I'm in Hold me again, don't count mistakes I lost track of them I’d be alright, if I could just see you Come up for air, come up for air A miracle mile, where does it lead to Come up for air, come up for airDon't sit around and complain about it I can't stand waiting around to dance, uh-huh Don't wanna talk, already know what I want You got big plans, but you never take a chance, uh-huh When will you stop wondering who you are I showed you mine, now show me yours Are you down to get serious Your wild life, coast to coast Make it last and let's take it slow I can't stand waiting around to dance, uh-huh When will you stop and look at the one you got You say you want to change this world Well, do you really believe in magic But you can only change yourself Don't sit around and complain about it All your friends, they got the nicest things, uh-huh Travel a lot, I don't understand their job In suspense, slipping right through my hands, uh-huh When will you stop wondering what they thought
