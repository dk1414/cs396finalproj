This song will become the anthem of your underground You're two floors down getting high in the back room If I flooded out your house, do you think you'd make it out Or would you burn up before the water filled your lungs And at your funeral I will sing the requiem This song will become the anthem of your underground You're two floors down getting high in the back room If I flooded out your house, do you think you'd make it out Or would you burn up before the water filled your lungs And at your funeral I will sing the requiem I'd offer you my hand It would hurt too much to watch you die And you can bet that when we mourn the death of you that night They'll lay me on the dinner table, I will be the pig With the apple in my mouth, the food that celebrates your end And at your funeral I will sing the requiem I'd offer you my hand It would hurt too much to watch you dieAs I'm talking My words slip to the floor And they crawl through your legs Slide under the back door Rendering me freakish and dazed Well, here I am Don't know how to say this Only thing I know is awkward silence Your eyelids close when you're around me To shut me out So I'll go walking in the streets'Til my heels bleed And I'll sing out my song In case the birds wish to sing along And I'll dig a tunnel to the center of the universe Well, here I am Don't know how to say this Only thing I know is awkward silence Your eyelids close when you're around me To shut me outHer life was magazines and faithful T V screens Selling an empty dream of cars and calories Everything in between the sun and Saturn's ring The price tag can't be seen And it took bites out of her insides'Til she was just a hollow shell Grew up in east L.A Watching celebrities Living out all her dreams The plastic canopy of U.S  royalty Drew her gaze towards the sky Away from her own mind And it took bites out of her insides'Til she was just a hollow shell And at her home her mother cried'Cause daddy had something on the side They didn't look up when she sighedI know I can't come near you Every time I do I get shaken inside and the sun in my eyes I'll stay away I'd rather be here Than anywhere with you Whoo I'd be dancing with your ghost Toasting note to note So here's to the passing Of all that could be Between you and me I'd rather be here Than anywhere with you Whoo I know I can not see you Even if I wanted to'cause your light is the light of ten sunsets Circled by eyes, burned blue and opened wide I'd rather be here Than anywhere with you WhooAnd I will flail under these lights That seep down from the bitter sky tonight And I will kick and beat my wrists together And feel an ocean breathing waves Feel them licking at my face Ceilings don't exist And there are no floors beneath me If I were king of this night Would you become my queen And I hope, your majesty That you like your position I'll do everything I can To keep you by my side And I'll stare off through the darkness To find us a kingdom Just kiss me before I go I'll have to walk a thousand miles Just to find the ground deserving of your feet You could throw me down And walk on me And I'd just look on through my love And through the hazeThis isn't the way we planned I wasn't supposed to forget your taste Like nights spent figuring all the ways that we came to this place There we were alone on top of your old rooftop in Highland Park Ask me now Say, "Chris, look out across the sky and tell me which way the wind blows."A core of coal A core of coal and starches A core of coal and starches within me Even now that you're not here I climb these mountains of houses every night I say your name, wish I could have done things rightThe last time that I saw you, August of '99 I should've had my hammer and a few rusty spikes To nail you on a wall and use bottles to catch your blood Display you for the neighbors so they'd know your time had come And I'd drink your blood Feel it dripping down my throat And heading for my heart And as your body sags and the stench rises in vain The people on the street are collecting in dismay Before their eyes, your head lifts towards the sky And that's the last thing they'll remember of you Cause I'd drink your blood Feel it dripping down my throat And heading for my heart You've become a ghost You're floating somewhere in between The waking world and a landscape of dreams Well it is nothing but dying Got a grenade stuck in your teeth and you're pulling at the pin You're an illusion, just a shadow flickering underneath the sunThis song will become the anthem of your underground You're two floors down getting high in the back room If I flooded out your house, do you think you'd make it out Or would you burn up before the water filled your lungs And at your funeral I will sing the requiem This
