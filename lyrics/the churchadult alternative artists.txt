Sometimes, when this place gets kind of empty Sound of their breath fades with the light I think about the loveless fascination Under the Milky Way tonight Lower the curtain down on Memphis Lower the curtain down, all right I got no time for private consultation Under the Milky Way tonight Wish I knew what you were looking for Might have known what you would find And it's something quite peculiar Something shimmering and white It leads you here, despite your destination Under the Milky Way tonight Wish I knew what you were looking for Might have known what you would find Wish I knew what you were looking for Might have known what you would findToo dangerous to keep Too feeble to let go And you want to bite the hand Should have stopped this long ago Go now, you've been set free Another month or so, you'll be gorging on me With your lovely smile I see you slither away with your skin and your tail Your flickering tongue and your rattling scales Like a real reptile Had you coiled around my arm How could you ever know How I loved your diamond eyes But that was long ago Go now, you've been set free Another month or so, you'll be poisoning me With your lovely smile I see you slither away with your skin and your tail Your flickering tongue and your rattling scales Like a real reptile And I should have believed Eve She said we had to blow She was the apple of my eye It wasn't long agoHere is where I lay it down Every burden, every crown This is my surrender This is my surrender Here is where I lay it down Every lie and every doubt This is my surrender And I will make room for You To do whatever You want to To do whatever You want to And I will make room for You To do whatever You want to To do whatever You want to, oh Here is where I lay it down Every burden, every crown This is my surrender This is my surrender Here is where I lay it down Every lie and every doubt This is my surrenderOur instruments have no way Of measuring this feeling Can never cut below the floor Or penetrate the ceiling In the space between our houses Some bones have been discovered But our procession lurches on As if we had recovered Draconian winter unforetold One solar day, suddenly you're old Your little envelope just makes me cold Makes destination start to unfold Our documents are useless Or forged beyond believing Page forty-seven is unsigned I need it by this evening In the space between our cities A storm is slowly forming Something eating up our days I feed it every morning Destination, destination Destination, destination Destination, destinationA war's being waged and the world's just a stage The real estate's prime, the number plates rhyme Wear a gun and be proud, but bare breasts aren't allowed Dream up a scam and then rake in the clams It's neither here nor there North and south and east and west It ought to be somewhere North and south and east and west I take my payment, I catch my flight And don't wait up for me tonight And you might find me there North and south and east and west Have a quick throw or host your own show To a wolf from a lamb, for just half a gram The face of today just a scalpel away, hey Restore your lost soul
