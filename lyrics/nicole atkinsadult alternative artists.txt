Walkin, spend a lot of time walkin That's what people do Gettin over you Smilin, did you see me smiling The whole act's just for you What else can I do People say I'm better off alone So I'm trying, trying, trying Oh please, if you see me cry I apologize, I'm a little crazy, crazy, crazy Together, we'd always be together I thought you felt the same Funny how things change People say it takes a little time So I'm trying, trying, trying Oh please, if you see me cry I apologize, I'm a little crazy, crazy, crazy People say I'm better of alone People say it takes a little time I can't hear a word those people say I know that I'm crazy, crazy, crazyLosing a night In basement town It’s a bump and run Man to man down Another fly Buzzin around Watching sped up scenes Spun by broken machines Life's a pearl for The nowhere girl Oh darlin see what you're missin Don’t worry I Pretended you Were someone else When I kissed you He said"Girl you look amazing This party's over Now I'd like to take you home"Don't tell me my love's not the one that I want That he's not the one that I need I'd rather find out for myself You're the one who shakes at the touch of my hand But can't decide where he should stand If I was smart, I'd never call you, call you ever again Oh, in my ears, my blood is just roaring When he's the only one I've ever wanted I suppose that's just the way it is Just to think This could be the last time I hold you Hold you ever again Oh, I don't think I'll ever sleep till morning'Cause he's the only one I've ever wanted Oh, and in my ears, my blood is just roaring'Cause he's the only one I've ever wanted I suppose that's just the way it isI first saw you like an old ghost story From my family tree that was handed down to me I've known you like a siren song that warns I have been informed you could be the death of me But patience pounds on the time that I stole You were meant to be mine I draw a duel with the cards of the gods That were played in fated time I know we'll meet again Maybe tonight Just tell me where and when I know it's never sure Maybe tonight Maybe tonight The sky whispers in a baritone That the mystery always beats what I am shown Search the dial for what I need to know They don't play those songs on my radio But patience pounds on the time that I stole You were meant to be mine I draw a duel with the cards of the gods That were played in fated timeSometimes I feel like I ruined everything Sometimes I feel like I’m slippin, slippin oh oh The way my brain and body, reacts to every memory Sometimes I feel like I’m slippim, slippin, oh oh I should’ve listened up when I was young But I always talked to much Punch drunk on some bad luck Hard times You gotta make mistakes to know It takes mistakes to grow And now I know I gotta listen up Oh listen up When life got real, when life got real I didn’t know if I could handle it Too many opinions I don’t wanna listen But when my brain and body holds onto every memory I need your help so please advise I should’ve listened up when I was young But I always talked to much Punch drunk on some bad luck Hard times You gotta make mistakes to know It takes mistakes to grow And now I know I gotta listen up Oh listen upOne way is up, one way is down Why am I waiting, waiting, waiting around I don't wanna play safe and sound When the world comes tumblin', tumblin' down Cuts me to the core Calm before the storm Tick, tick, tick, tock, time is up This message will self destruct Hey, hey, hey, hey, look out below Watch 'em fall like dominos I don't wanna play safe and sound When the world comes tumblin', tumblin' down Take me in your arms Keep sounding the alarm Tick, tick, tick, tock, time is up This message will self destruct Hey, hey, hey, hey, look out below Watch 'em fall like dominosThere's a million ways to leave your past To turn your eyes and watch it die Hometown hopes, they fade, they fade and change Just like a joke passed down in time Hiding out in alleyways And sleeping on the beaches in the summer We would try anything, anything just once If it seemed cool enough Everyone I've known that has turned cold When they felt old, their fear has stayed Hometown heroes fall as years go by Like dominoes, a dark parade I'll go anywhere I'll go anywhere you want, if you'll take me I know that I don't know you very well But you seem cool enough I don't care where you're going, you're taking me with you This place's got nothing that I could want But I think that someday I might feel different Feel that someday, oh, still that someday take me with youI am raising a flag, I am just too tired now to fight It's white and it's waving, can't we save this for another night I used to be afraid, but now I crave the quiet Together we are both alone, but I don't mind I'll dream of something to try and make us alright To make us alright Baby, put your arms down They're machines that can't be fixed no more'Cause when the alarm sounds I'll be right here waiting at your door We'll sit up on the bed for a while Together we are both alone, but we don't mind We'll dream of something to try and make us alright To make us alright, it's alright, it's alright To make us alright, it's alright, it's alright But the dawn is trouble When I close my eyes, you never go away I've tried everything, still you won't change Is it better if you go But the ending doesn't matter One hundred days and then the suffering stops Running faster through this Hope to save your heart before it drops And you can never say I didn't try Together we are both alone, but I don't mind I dreamt of everything, I tried to make us alrightMy, my, my, my past lives have got me weary I, I, I, tiptoe past so you can’t hear me You wake up in the middle of the night With your heart beating hard Knowing something isn’t right I’m sleepwalking Sleepwalking Around the world I used to dream in So much time has gone by but I’m still haunted To forgive and forget is all I wanted Past is past, I should leave it where it lies I can smile to your face but you can see it in my eyes I’m sleepwalking Sleepwalking Around the world I used to dream in Waiting to begin again Until then I’m sleepwalking I’m sleepwalking Sleepwalking Around the world I used to dream in Waiting to begin again Until then I’m sleepwalkingYou can't see me from this view All the way down Trailing the procession I'll hide out a few more days Then I'll be leaving this place soon Our hearts are singing out just for you A cemetery song for summer And if we knew just what we could do A cemetery song we'd not sing I'm sitting over Neptune City I used to love it It used to be pretty I'll come down, walk around a while Until I'm sure I can never go home again Maybe if I paid attention I could learn to love the landscape I was born to By the river in the rain Let it make me new again Our hearts are singing out just for you A cemetery song for summer And if we knew just what we could do A cemetery song we'd not sing
