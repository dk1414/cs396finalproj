Like sugar, the sweetest thing I ever tasted Like a fine Merlot, and white pills cut on glass and lips of dolls I'm told there was beauty in our silence So hold me angel, love me angel Kiss the sun and burn our lips dead radio Candy girl, you will never ever, ever Make me the perfect killer Outside the rabbit hole is a candy shop of poison A velvet tongue demur is cast and melted We are not alone, a creature stirs outside these paper walls These gods are hollow and burned Ignite this angel, love me angel Kiss the sun and burn our lips dead radio Candy girl, you will never ever, ever Make me the perfect killer Outside the rabbit hole is a candy shop of poison The sweetest thing I ever tasted...Invite me to pray, let the music glow Ignite my eyes and watch the poison flow Say it with me: "We Are Ghost"Not too loud, the Kingdom followsFortunes in Hades are the last hope Swallow...Forgive the Leopard King and the hangman's gallows Shark people wear shark clothes!The bite was ugly as sin But we were ready, disguised the malice stone Our friend Lazarus sleeps Her lips shake with every, with every word You were my favorite We both know our love will never end Conform me in, into the wicked...Into the lonely mass grave four-legged dancers!Silence the Spider Queen and watch her eyes glow Inside the fake I see, I'll burn this halo Shark people wear shark clothes!The bite was ugly as sin But we were ready, disguised the malice stone Our friend Lazarus sleeps Her lips shake with every, with every word You were my favorite We both know our love will never end Conform me in, into the wicked.. Look how you've grown, it's etched in skin and bone Dressed in make-up and bleached out in the roses That's hollow and tasteless where the spirits make love And pretty corpses hold their brides Do you know I'd never hurt you So taste "it" and we will never be alone I'll take the first bite, yeah, I am Ghost Say goodnight to you, my darling, my darling Few words can kill me, they inspire in your hands The sun outside these glass-shaped walls Will burn the flesh off paper dolls My lips and tongue, they bleed...We won't fall, we'll be together, just the two of us That's hollow and breathless It kills me slowly, lost and lonely Do you know that I'd never hurt you So taste "it" and we will never be alone I'll take the first bite, yeah, I am Ghost Say goodnight to you, my darling, my darling I am so sorry, so take this rose And break this bottle of aged pills Taste the blue ones, and we will sleep through December Awake to the birth of an Angel, she has your eyes And I will hide from them, don't worry Soon she will grow, I can't believe this is all my fault Yeah, soon she will grow Unbury me and put me back together again Taste it Taste it Sad rose for life because I am already dead So taste "it" and we will never be alone I'll take the first bite, yeah, I am Ghost Say goodnight to you, my darling, my darlingClose your eyes It's easier that way...A golden cup And a toast to kings Lost and decayed, we are cut beyond our saving But we are home now, the room is still warm I fell in love with an Angel, a heart that isn't cold Say goodnight, we are dying, just hold on Bless these shadows and tested every one They can't steal our love tonight A century of open arms that shield the light This battle scar is healing Cast all the pain to the tourniquet that binds me But we are home now, the sun won't hurt you anymore...I fell in love with an Angel, a heart that isn't cold Say goodnight, we are dying, just hold on Bless these shadows and tested everyone They can't steal our love tonight Love has given me a reason to live...And love has given me a reason to die I fell in love with an Angel, a heart that isn't cold Say goodnight, we are dying, just hold on Bless these shadows and tested everyone They can't steal our love tonight I fell in love with an Angel, a heart that isn't cold, isn't cold, isn't cold I can feel the pain of the sun as it lights up the air I can taste the hope, it's everywhereIt's a cold dark night Hallows Eve upon the crest In a parking lot of Vampires in suits to look their best And the music Next to coffins made of gold With friends and lovers freshly buried Her beauty washes over me So let us hide and we'll dance the night away Kiss the rise of the sun Then we'll melt away That's who we are:We are always searching Always searching In a white dress, with no eyes Black suit red devil bow tie The King and Queen are crowned Victorian"Is this the last of our haunting "She says as she floats like an angel"You will never know until you let me go I'm hoping this will never end!"Her beauty washes over me So let us hide and we'll dance the night away Kiss the rise of the sun, then we'll melt away That'ss who we are:We are always searching Always searching Soon the stage enacts the fallen stars Used in pictures in this page of our beating hearts I've made peace with God and burned the sage And drank from poison lakes Soon the stage enacts the fallen stars Save us from all the evil that we do Tonight we're ghosts I've fallen down but never give up Create what was left behind, it was you Beyond the hourglass And a hundred years have passed, buried in stone My heart still beats outside this Please put the final nail into this coffin The sentry, eyes closed Remember me as you are reborn Save us from all the evil that we do Tonight we're ghosts I've fallen down but never give up Create what was left behind, it was youI was alone wasting away True son do not die I was the poison You were the kiss Angel take a breath now This ghost inside you hurts And I never said goodbye Don't wake up There is a sickness in the roses Hold me and drown Unfortunate kiss is too close to see True son do now cry, yea Fly away this is war Angel take a breath now This ghost inside you hurts And I never said goodbye Don't wake up There is a sickness in the roses Hold me and drown Don't wake up There is a sickness in the roses Can you stay for a while Take my hand and let's set ourselves on fire They say that love is warThe hunger dressed alone Ten years have gone and past A vision of carnival Dark days Immaculate Search the town of millions of smiling clowns Red cat monster beauty has her hands in chains Her eyes still glow like heaven Broken, unsound, cut her wings off The night: a vampire trademark Dead man walking free The dancing has created a fire Two-headed strong man disgust, desire Midnight Break bones Create A war for purity The blood we shared The love we cannot let go Her eyes still glow like heaven Broken, unsound, cut her wings off The night: a vampire trademark Dead man walking freeThis book of love is a final gift, dramatic in its virtue It's a beating heart I made for you Ten razors buried bones And a kiss that tastes like violence Blue sand shadows look from above, yeah We're not alone The dead will rise again Show me why we won't let go and we still Must pray This is our lovers' requiem As wings unfold, just breathe for me...In freaks below, a savage plot of golden dust And chariots of liars, a course of waiting For existence Sin's bleeding cast has struck a nerve Sin's bleeding hand has filled the lakes For you and me a war has just begun A sharpened sword, ice and cuts And laughing dolls, tonight they live again Show me why we won't let go and we still Must pray This is our lovers' requiem As wings unfold, just breathe for me...Oh heaven's gate will cast a shadowLike sugar, the sweetest thing I ever tasted Like a fine Merlot, and white pills cut on glass and lips of dolls I'm told there was beauty in our silence So hold me angel, love me angel Kiss the sun and burn our lips dead radio Candy girl, you will never ever, ever Make me the perfect killer Outside the rabbit hole is a candy shop of poison A velvet tongue demur is cast and melted We are not alone, a creature stirs outside these paper walls These gods are hollow and burned Ignite this angel, love me angel Kiss the sun and burn our lips dead radio Candy girl, you will never ever, ever Make me the perfect killer Outside the rabbit hole is a candy shop of poison The sweetest thing I ever tasted...Invite me to pray, let the music glow Ignite my eyes and watch the poison flow Say it with me: "We Are Ghost"Not too loud, the Kingdom follows
