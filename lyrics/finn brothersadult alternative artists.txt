There's a wild thing in the woolshed And it's keeping me awake at night A devil in the closet And a feeling I'd prefer to hide He is religion He won't hear me when I cry for help He has a vision of me But I am somebody else We talk There are times when I'm tied up to the fence Only talking sense There's a mirror lake before me But I'm frozen when it's time to jump It's like maybe I'm afraid of what I'll find When independence comes You steal my shadow You make my blood run dry We are true only when we talk the pillow There are times when I'm tied up to the fence But I'm only talking sense Well I'm only talking sense Did you suffer as a child That's why you want to make me cry You are afraid of me That's why you're so unkindIf you call me up, I'll say a few words But I'll try not to speak too long Please to be kind and I'll try to explain I'll probably get it all wrong What does it mean when you promise someone That no matter how hard or whatever may come It means that I won't give in, won't give in, won't give in'Cause everyone I love is here Play it once, and disappear Once in a while I return to the fold And people I call my own Even if time is just a flicker of light And we all have to die alone What does it mean when you belong to someone When you're born with a name, and you carry it on It means that I won't give in, won't give in, won't give in'Cause everyone I love is here All at once, and I'll show you how to get here Come on now, come on now, can you feel it, I can see it in ya Come on now, come on now, reveal it, turn around won't ya The right time, the right place, right now, turn aroundI know that it's you behind Everything that I do And I wouldn't try to hide Who I am from you It's all me That you see I was ready for another try But I needed you to set me free Must be the luckiest man alive Man finds love in his life He's the luckiest man alive Someone true by his side He's the luckiest man alive Once you cut right through His foolish pride He's the luckiest man alive I've never had the time before Leaving things where they fell I was going door to door Always thinking I was somewhere else You saw me And what I could be And now I know what love is for It's the only thing sets you free Must be the luckiest man aliveWick in the candle what lies beneath Look in the shadows and the spaces in between A vision ghosted appearing on my screen Soul where is my soul where is my soul Soul where is my soul where is my soul I seek contentment, I'm acting still All airs and graces with a smile before you kill Hold back the hostile crowd before they trample you down Soul where is my soul where is my soul Soul where is my soul where is my soul And I go up with my conscience clean Down below they're looking for me But I know you've got my soul Oh holy ancient, I'll smoke you up I'll take your wisdom and I'll turn you into dust You fill my ashtray, the one I've come to trust Soul where is my soul where is my soul Soul where is my soul where is my soul Soul you've lost control of all you've had Soul where is my soul, your will so badIt's a slow parade Down a dusty road We've learned to take abuse From devils we don't know People who have lost all heart Look for someone else to blame You just keep on walking When they call you a dirty name All the mud in this town All the dirt in this world None of it sticks on you Cause you're better than that And you don't need it There's nothing wrong with you The moment that we dread It comes all too soon Voices in your head Still carry on the tune Let the sound come in From the world outside You just keep on singing When they tell you filthy liesDay Has begun And I stumble To the front There's no Real control Of a random Event And I will take my chances'Cos anything can happen I don't believe it's over'Cos anything can happen I could never Give it up I could never relent And I can't Wait to see What will happen To me next I will take my chances'Cos anything can happen I don't believe it's over'Cos anything can happenThe firelight plays on me The choir ignites behind me The rising voice of discontent All the guardian angels You can bang the drum Look what we've become I hope there might be one of us Who calls the tune Last day of June The so called third dimension Hardly deserves a mention The first and second stages Have been confused for ages Knowledge has been lost How much does it cost I hope there might be one of us Who calls the tune Last day of June Who breaks the news Last day of June The city draws it's breath in I can almost hear it thinking There are people within my walls See their wild disorder Driving their machines Swarming like a million bees I hope there might be one of us Who calls the tune Last day of June Who speaks the truth Last day of June Who breaks the news Last day of JuneEverybody wants the same thing Everybody wants the same thing To see another birthday Look at all the pretty numbers Look at all the pretty numbers Scattered on the calendars I can see my reflection I can see my reflection In the shop window Who owns that space Declare it if you dare tonight Don't let the moment pass Until another day Bright lights dissolve Like sugar deep inside you now It all ends up the same somehow I'm hardly here at all All the trash and the treasure All the trash and the treasure All the pain and the pleasureOver these green hills Blue electric light Always in my blood Forever in my eyes Black window space A basket made of flax Broken mirror view Let your eyes relax Mist On my glass Watch it all Come to pass Once again We'll breathe in the view It's part of me Part of you Now my voice won't sing And my tears won't cry Your disciple waits For any good advice Our place in time It's not set in stone And we'll still be here Where the cows come homeIn so many ways I'm the same as you In so many things Better left unsaid From out of the deep well The water flows into the sea And that's the way it starts And continues to unfold But to both of us That will never change And we're staring at Each other Like the banks of A river And we can't get Any closer I won't give control to anyone Walk around , kiss the ground Like I own the place But in the passage of time The river banks get washed away And that's the way it starts And continues to evolve I reveal myself You watch over me
