Pretty woman, walking down the street Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet Pretty woman, I don't believe you You're not the truth No one could look as good as you Mercy!Pretty woman, won't you pardon me Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see Pretty woman, that you look lovely as can be Are you lonely just like me Rwar-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r Pretty woman, stop a while Pretty woman, talk a while Pretty woman, give your smile to me Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah Pretty woman, look my way Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me'Cause I need you, I'll treat you right Come with me, baby, be mine tonightA candy-colored clown they call the sandman Tiptoes to my room every night Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper"Go to sleep, everything is alright"I close my eyes, then I drift away Into the magic night, I softly say A silent prayer like dreamers do Then I fall asleep to dreams, my dreams of you In dreams, I walk with you In dreams, I talk to you In dreams, you're mine all of the time We're together in dreams, in dreams But just before the dawn I awake and find you gone I can't help it, I can't help it if I cry I remember that you said goodbye It's too bad that all these things Can only happen in my dreams Only in dreams In beautiful dreamsEvery time I look into your loving eyes I see a love that money just can't buy One look from you, I drift away I pray that you are here to stay Anything you want, you got it Anything you need, you got it Anything at all, you got it Baby Every time I hold you, I begin to understand Everything about you tells me I'm your man I live my life to be with you No one can do the things you do Anything you want, you got it Anything you need, you got it Anything at all, you got it Baby Anything you want Anything you need Anything at allI was alright for a while I could smile for a while But I saw you last night You held my hand so tight As you stopped to say, "Hello"Oh, you wished me well You couldn't tell That I'd been crying over you Crying over you When you said, "So long"Left me standing all alone Alone and crying, crying Crying, crying It's hard to understand But the touch of your hand Can start me crying I thought that I was over you But it's true, so true I love you even more Than I did before But, darling, what can I do I feel so bad I've got a worried mind I'm so lonesome all the time Since I left my baby behind on Blue Bayou Saving nickels, saving dimes Working 'till the sun don't shine Looking forward to happier times On Blue Bayou I'm going back some day Come what may to Blue Bayou Where you sleep all day And the catfish play on Blue Bayou All those fishing boats With their sails afloat If I could only see That familiar sunrise Through sleepy eyes How happy I'd be Go to see my baby again And to be with some of my friends Maybe I'd be happy then on Blue Bayou I'm going back some day Gonna stay on Blue Bayou Where the folks are fine And the world is mine On Blue Bayou Oh, that girl of mine by my side The silver moon and the evening tide Oh, some sweet day gonna take away This hurtin' inside I'll never be blue My dreams come true on Blue BayouDum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah Ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah Oh-oh-oh-oh-wah Only the lonely Only the lonely Only the lonely Know the way I feel tonight Only the lonely Know this feeling ain't right And there goes my baby There goes my heart They're gone forever So far apart But only the lonely Know why I cry Only the lonely Dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah Ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah Oh-oh-oh-oh-wah Only the lonely Only the lonelyWorkin' all day And the sun don't shine Trying to get by And I'm just killing time I feel the rain Fall the whole night through Far away from you California blue California blue Dreaming all alone Nothing else to do California blue Everyday I pray I'll be on my way Saving love for you California blue One sunny day I'll get back again Somehow, someway But I don't know when California blue California blueJust runnin' scared each place we go So afraid that he might show Yeah, runnin' scared, what would I do If he came back and wanted you Just runnin' scared, feelin' low Runnin' scared, you love him so Just runnin' scared, afraid to lose If he came back which one would you choose Then all at once he was standing there So sure of himself, his head in the air My heart was breaking, which one would it be You turned around and walked away with meDarkness falls and she Will take me by the hand Take me to some twilight land Where all but love is grey Where I can’t find my way Without her as my guide Night falls, I’m cast beneath her spell Daylight comes, our heaven turns to hell Am I left to burn And burn eternally She’s a mystery to me She’s a mystery girl She’s a mystery girl In the night of love Words tangled in her hair Words soon to disappear A love so sharp it cut Like a switchblade to my heart Words tearing me apartI had to escape The city was sticky and cruel Maybe I should have called you first But I was dying to get to you I was dreaming while I drove the long straight road ahead, Uh-huh, yeah Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide This fever for you was just burning me up inside I drove all night to get to you Is that all right I drove all night, crept in your room Woke you from your sleep to make love to you Is that all right I drove all night What in this world Keeps us from falling apart No matter where I go I hear The beating of our one heart I think about you when the night is cold and dark Uh-huh, yeah No one can move me the way that you do Nothing erases this feeling between me and yoooooou Ohhhhhhh
