Chorus I’m seeing ghosts, every move I make They can’t break me , they can’t break me I can feel the spirit of the drum This worlds my turf all that’s under the sun I can feel the spirit of the drum This worlds my turf all that’s under the sun Verse 1 A warrior puts on for the people I will never fear any evil You can never quiet my voice All praise to the maker is my choice I got fire inside but my flow is water Star dust in my soul I put that on my honour Old Native America tell me how you feel Would you die over ethics  Come on tell me for real We blessed by nature, Blessed for battle I hear the war cries sitting perfect on the rattle A snake chase it tale, a phoenix earns it’s wings I fear no thing as the holy man sings Chorus 2 I’m seeing ghosts, every move I make They can’t break me , they can’t break me I can feel the spirit of the drum This worlds my turf all that’s under the sun I can feel the spirit of the drum This worlds my turf all that’s under the sunStressed Street I ain't playin' with no lames, my neechie And I ain't feelin' no cops, my neechie No, not all of us deal, my dude'Cause some of us got 9 to 5s, my dude C'mon c'mon, I'ma rock out, rock out Turn the block out, block out C'mon c'mon, like block out, block out We don't back down, back down Smoke the block out, block out No Indian in the cupboard, just a neechie and his brothers Double-lining bolts, best believe we bring the thunder Pyoot be the rez pres, Got money in the mattress Stressed street, big beats, killin' these Ojibway beats Smudge one for my enemies, I truly really wish 'em peace Shoutout to my cousin still heartened for the elders Me I run with outlaws, the savages, the scalpers I'm the original aboriginal You and your people are not even as critical As your king-to-be, your position is minuscule Back in the day I knew the right people who could get rid of you But times change, you lames are so laned I speed past, untamed, kill your mindframe Salute the man's aim, stars and milky way My neechies know me, I'm rappin' all day Let out a roar, we getting jungle tonight Fancy pants, yeah, we might as well dance Stardust and and the vibes is right No honky-tonky, just funk-dafy Got moves like we pharaoh's sweet Love is the motive, we Don't know no better life Almost like we are possessed Possessed Possessed Possessed When I first learned that boogey-woogey-oogey My motivation was I need her goodies Here we go, it's that coming-of-agе She see me too like I'm cеnter stage Her demeanour Paris like the Eiffel Tower More rare than a golden flower Let music the play and our bodies sway The eve is young, so you may as well stay Over tonight, I know the best brunch spot I'm sure of myself ,you can see my strut Feeling like this apacalipto My world is over when we calipso Lock lips, though that P DA Royalty's in my D NA Follow me, I'ma lead the way Where we going is where the wild playChorus I’m seeing ghosts, every move I make They can’t break me , they can’t break me I can feel the spirit of the drum This worlds my turf all that’s under the sun I can feel the spirit of the drum This worlds my turf all that’s under the sun Verse 1 A warrior puts on for the
