tell you little somethin’ why you ain’t shit It ain’t a emcee's jock that you don’t hug You even bit your name from the “Lovebug”And now to bite a nigga’s name, that’s some low-down shit If you was

everybody thinkin’ that that rhyme's yours  Every time I hear it, I throw a fit Party after party – the same old shit!Record after record, rhyme after rhyme Always want to know your zodiac sign He

you know what time it is   Do you know what time it is   Do you know what time it is I'm not goin', I'm gone Up up up and away and I'm on A higher plane with a brain with a flame Feel the fire, desire the same Knowledge and wisdom and understanding Possessed by gods, transferred to man in A script of a book or a scripture that looks Like a Biblical writing, inviting a hook Of a song sing along with a strong subliminal Message divesting all men from criminal Acts of the Devil, revealed and reveled Designed to recline the mind to lower level Read the Holy Koran or the Bible Because it's liable to be a revival For the weak who seek power it'll bring Infallible power, knowledge is king Now who wants some  Come get it A battle is a test of wits and I'm witted Hard beats a torch and I lit it Set the world on fire, I did it Now that it feels good, I'm heating up I feed off knowledge and can't get enough'Cause knowledge is infinite, suckers ain't into it Ignorance is bliss and they're kin to it They party and dance and don't ever glance At a book or look for their mind to advance Caught in a rut chasing butt Trying to get a dollar or a nut Evil feeds off a source of apathy Weak in the mind and of course you have to be Less than a man, more like a thing No knowledge you're nothing, knowledge is kingThe wild wild west The wild wild west The wild wild west The wild wild west The wild wild
