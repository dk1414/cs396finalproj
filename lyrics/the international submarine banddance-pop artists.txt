You think I'm lonesome so do I, so do IWay down south In the state of Georgia Through the swamps And everglades There's a hole in tiger mountain God help the man who gets lost in Miller's Cave I had a girl In Waycross, Georgia But she had unfaithful ways You know, she made me feel unwanted Like the bats and the bears in Miller's Cave I caught her out One Sunday morningWell, I hear that train a comin'Comin' around the bend And I ain't seen the sunshine Since I don't know when And I'm stuck in Folsom Prison I'm bound to stay and die And when I hear the lonesome whistle I hang my head down and cry Well, now when I was a baby My momma told me, "Son Always be a good boy Don't you ever play with guns"But I shot a man in Reno Just to watch him die And when I hear the lonesome whistle I hang my head down and cry Well, now if I was a railroad If that old freight train was mine I think I'd get it moving Just a little down the line But I knew I had it comin'I had to carry-on And now I hear the whistle blowin'Down th–µ San AntoneStrong boy You're wrong, boy You think you've got my baby now But this fight ain't quite won You shorted me A might big mistake'Cause muscles ain't enough To make her run away from me She knows what kind of lover I can be Strong boy You're wrong, boy My baby likes to have her fun But I'm the one she lovesWell, I used to be the kind of guy that didn't love a lot I took all the love they offered me with ease And it didn't make much difference if they loved me or not'Cause I'd love 'em for awhile then I'd leave Yeah, and I can't believe it's really me hurtin' like I do Just because you left me all alone I've seen it happen many times to other guys I knew Surely, I must be somebody else you've known Well, when I first met you darlin'You impressed me more than some I should have took the warnin' way back then But, I never stopped to think that That even my day had become And like the other guys I'd want you back again Yeah, and I can't believe it's really me hurtin' like I do Just because you left me all alone I've seen it happen many times to other guys I knew Surely, I must be somebody else you've known Surely, I must be somebody else you've knownAt my door the leaves are falling The cold, cold winds will come Sweethearts walk by together And I still miss someone No, I never got over those blue eyes I see them everywhere And I miss the arms that held me When all our love was there I go out on wild parties And I look for a little fun But I find the darkened corner'Cause I still miss someone No, I never got over those blue eyesHow many times Have you heard someone say If I had his money I'd do things my way But little they know'Cause it's so hard to find One rich man in ten With a satisfied mind With a satisfied mind Money won't buy back Your youth when you're old Or a friend when you're lonesome Or a love that's grown coldSometimes I get upset When people treat me bad I don't have time to think And so I get real mad I pull my hair And find somewhere That I can be alone But when I do I think of you And then I hurry home Where I got chores to keep me busy A clock to keep my time A pretty girl to love me With the same last name as mineDo you know how it feels to be lonesome When there's just no one left who really cares Did you ever try to smile at some people And all they ever seem to do is stare Can you remember how it feels to be cold again When the happiness of love has gone away And you never want to go out on the street again And you only seem to live from day to day Do you know how it feels to be lonesome When there's just no one left who really cares Did you ever try to smile at some people And all they ever seem to do is stare Can you remember how it feels to be cold againWell the luxury
