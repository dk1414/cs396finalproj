Hey, where did we go Days when the rains came Down in the hollow Playin' a new game Laughing and a running, hey, hey Skipping and a jumping In the misty morning fog with Our hearts a thumpin' and you My brown-eyed girl You, my brown-eyed girl Whatever happened To Tuesday and so slow Going down the old mine With a transistor radio Standing in the sunlight laughing Hiding behind a rainbow's wall Slipping and sliding All along the waterfall, with you My brown-eyed girl You, my brown-eyed girl Do you remember when we used to sing Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-te-da Just like that Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-te-da-la-te-daWe were born before the wind Also younger than the sun Ere the bonnie boat was won As we sailed into the mystic Hark, now hear the sailors cry Smell the sea and feel the sky Let your soul and spirit fly Into the mystic And when that foghorn blows I will be coming home, mmhmm hmm And when the foghorn blows I want to hear it I don't have to fear it And I want to rock your gypsy soul Just like way back in the days of old And magnificently we will float Into the mystic, mmmWell, it’s a marvelous night for a moondance With the stars up above in your eyes A fantabulous  night to make romance’Neath the cover of October skies And all the leaves on the trees are falling To the sound of the breezes that blow And I’m trying to please to the calling Of your heartstrings that play soft and low You know the night’s magic seems to whisper and hush You know the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love Can I just make some more romance with you, my love Well, I want to make love to you tonight I can’t wait ’til the morning has come And I know now the time is just right And straight into my arms you will run And when you come my heart will be waiting To make sure that you’re never alone There and then all my dreams will come true, dear There and then I will make you my ownAnd I will stroll the merry way and jump the hedges first And I will drink the clear clean water for to quench my thirst And I shall watch the ferry-boats, and they'll get high On a bluer ocean against tomorrow's sky And I will never grow so old again And I will walk and talk in gardens all wet with rain Oh-uh-oh-oh, sweet thing, this sweet thing Eh-eh-yo, sweet thing Yeah-yeah my, my, my, my, my sweet thing And I shall drive my chariot down your streets and cry Hey, it's me, I'm dynamite, and I don't know why And you shall take me strongly in your arms again And I will not remember that I ever felt the pain We shall walk and talk in gardens all misty wet All misty wet with rain down And I will never, never, never grow so old againIf I ventured in the slipstream Between the viaducts of your dream Where immobile steel rims crack And the ditch in the back roads stop Could you find me Would you kiss-a my eyes To lay me down In silence easy To be born again To be born again From the far side of the ocean If I put the wheels in motion And I stand with my arms behind me And I'm pushin' on the door Could you find me Would you kiss-a my eyes To lay me down In silence easy To be born again To be born againHalf a mile from the county fair And the rain came pourin' down Me and Billy standin' there With a silver half a crown Hands are full of a fishin' rod And the tackle on our backs We just stood there gettin' wet With our backs against the fence Oh, the water Oh, the water Oh, the water Hope it don't rain all day And it stoned me to my soul Stoned me just like Jelly Roll And it stoned me And it stoned me to my soul Stoned me just like goin' home And it stoned me And the rain let up And the sun came up And we were gettin' dry Almost let a pick-up truck Nearly pass us by So we jumped right in And the driver grinned And he dropped us up the road And we looked at the swim And we jumped right in Not to mention fishing polesDown on Cyprus Avenue With a childlike vision leaping into view Clicking, clacking of the high-heeled shoe Ford and Fitzroy, Madame George Marching with the soldier boy behind He's much older now with hat on drinking wine And that smell of sweet perfume comes drifting through The cool night air like Shalimar And outside they're making all the stops The kids out in the street collecting bottle-tops Gone for cigarettes and matches in the shops Happy taken Madame George That's when you fall Whoa, that's when you fall Yeah, that's when you fall When you fall into a trance Sitting on a sofa playing games of chance With your folded arms and history books You glance into the eyes of Madame George And you think you found the bag You're getting weaker and your knees begin to sag In the corner playing dominoes in drag The one and only Madame GeorgeWhen it's not always raining There'll be days like this When there's no one complaining There'll be days like this Everything falls into place Like the flick of a switch Well my mama told me There'll be days like this When you don't need to worry There'll be days like this When no one's in a hurry There'll be days like this When you don't get betrayed By that old Judas kiss Oh my mama told me There'll be days like this When you don't need an answer There'll be days like this When you don't meet a chancer There'll be days like this When all the parts of the puzzle Start to look like they fit Then I must remember There'll be days like thisDon't wanna discuss it Think it's time for a change You may get disgusted Start thinking that I'm strange That case I'll go underground Get some heavy rest Never have to worry About what is worst or what is best Oh, oh Domino, alright Roll me over, Romeo There you go Lord have mercy I said: Oh, oh Domino Roll me over Romeo There you go Say it again I said: Oh, oh Domino I said: Oh, oh Domino Dig it There's no need for argument There's no argument at all And if you never hear from him That just means he didn't call Or vice-a-versa That depends on wherever you're at And if you never hear from me That just means I would rather notI've been searching a long time For someone exactly like you I've been travelling all around the world
