I'm tryin' to tell you somethin' 'bout my life Maybe give me insight between black and white And the best thing you ever done for me Is to help me take my life less seriously It's only life after all, yeah Well, darkness has a hunger that's insatiable And lightness has a call that's hard to hear And I wrap my fear around me like a blanket I sailed my ship of safety until I sank it I'm crawling on your shores And I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains I looked to the children, I drank from the fountains There's more than one answer to these questions Pointing me in a crooked line And the less I seek my source for some definitive Closer I am to fine, yeah Closer I am to fine, yeah And I went to see the doctor of philosophy With a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee He never did marry or see a B-grade movie He graded my performance, he said he could see through me I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind Got my paper, and I was freeGalileo's head was on the block The crime was looking up the truth And as the bombshells of my daily fears explode I try to trace them to my youth And then you had to bring up reincarnation Over a couple of beers the other night And now I'm serving time for mistakes Made by another in another lifetime How long 'til my soul gets it right Can any human being ever reach that kind of light I call on the resting soul of Galileo King of night vision, king of insight And then I think about my fear of motion Which I never could explain Some other fool across the ocean years ago Must have crashed his little airplane How long 'til my soul gets it right Can any human being ever reach that kind of light I call on the resting soul of Galileo King of night vision, king of insightNow the parking lot is empty Everyone's gone someplace I pick you up and in the trunk I've packed A cooler and a two-day suitcase'Cause there's a place we like to drive Way out in the country Five miles out of the city limit we're singing And your hand's upon my knee So we're okay, we're fine Baby, I'm here to stop your crying Chase all the ghosts from your head I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed Smarter than the tricks played on your heart We'll look at them together then we'll take 'em apart Adding up the total of a love that's true Multiply life by the power of two You know the things that I am afraid of I'm not afraid to tell And if we ever leave a legacy It's that we loved each other well'Cause I've seen the shadows of so many people Trying on the treasures of youth But a road that fancy and fast ends in a fatal crash And I'm glad we got off to tell you the truthThere's a letter on the desktop That I dug out of a drawer The last truce we ever came to From our adolescent war And I start to feel the fever From the warm air through the screen You come regular like seasons Shadowing my dreams And the Mississippi's mighty But it starts in Minnesota At a place that you could walk across With five steps down And I guess that's how you started Like a pinprick to my heart But at this point you rush right through me And I start to drown And there's not enough room in this world for my pain Signals cross and love gets lost and time passed makes it plain Of all my demon spirits I need you the most I'm in love with your ghost I'm in love with your ghostI sit two stories above the street It's awful quiet here since love fell asleep There's life down below me though The kids are walking home from school Some long ago when we were taught That for whatever kind of puzzle you got You just stick the right formula in A solution for every fool I remember the time when I came so close to you Sent me skipping my class and running from school And I bought you that ring, 'cause I never was cool What makes me think I could start clean slated The hardest to learn was the least complicated Oh, I just sit up in the house and resist And not be seen until I cease to exist A kind of conscientious objection A kind of dodging the draftMy friends they wash the windows And they shine in the sun They tell me wake up early in the morning sometime See what a beautiful job we've done I say let's put on some tunes Sing along and Doolittle all day Go down to the riverside take off our shoes And wash these sins away And the river said La la la it said shame on you And the river said La la la it said shame on you I go down to Chicano city park'Cause it makes me feel so fine And when the weeds go down you can see up close In the dead of the winter time But when the summer comes everything's in bloom And you wouldn't know it's there And the white folks like to pretend it's not But their music's in the airA love-struck Romeo Sings the streets a serenade Now he's layin' everybody low He's got a love song that he made He finds a convenient street light And he steps out of the shade, and he says something like"You and me babe, how about it "Juliet says, "Hey it's Romeo He nearly gave me a heart attack" yeah well He's underneath my window, now she's singing"Hey-la my boyfriend's back"Oh, you shouldn't come around here Singing up to people like that Oh anyway, whatcha gonna do about it Juliet, the dice were loaded from the start And I bet, and you exploded into my heart And I forget, I forget, the movie song When you gonna realize It was just that the time was wrong JulieSome will strut and some will fret See this an hour on this stage Others will not but they'll sweat In their hopelessness, in their rage We're all the same The men of anger And the women of the page They published your diary And that's how I got to know you The key to the room of your own and a mind without end And here's a young girl On a kind of a telephone line through time And the voice at the other end comes like a long lost friend So I know I'm all right My life will come, my life will go Still I feel it's all right'Cause I just got a letter to my soul When my whole life is on the tip of my tongue Empty pages for the no longer young The apathy of time laughs in my face You say each life has its placeThe thin horizon of a plan is almost clear My friends and I have had a tough time Bruising our brains, hard up against change All the old dogs and the magician Now I see we're in the boat in two by twos Only the heart that we have for a tool we could use And the very close quarters are hard to get used to Love weighs the hull down with its weight But the wood is tired and the wood is old And we'll make it fine if the weather holds But if the weather holds, we'll have missed the point That's where I need to go No way construction of this tricky plan Was built by other than a greater hand With a love that passes all our understanding Watching closely over the journey Yeah, but what it takes to cross the great divide Seems more than all the courage I can muster up inside Although we get to have some answers, when we reach the other side The prize is always worth the rocky rideI have spent nights with matches and knives Leaning over ledges only two flights up Cutting my heart, burning my soul Nothing left to hold Nothing left but blood and fire You have spent nights thinking of me Missing my arms but you needed to leave Leaving my cuts, leaving my burns Hoping I'd learn But blood and fire are too much for these restless arms to hold And my nights of desire, they're calling me back to your fold And I'm calling you, calling you, from ten thousand miles away Won't you wet my fire with your love, babe I am looking for someone who can take as much as I give, baby Gonna give back as much as I need you know And they, they still have the will to live, ah no'Cause I am intense, I am in need, I am in pain, I am in love But I feel forsaken, you know like the things I, I gave away
