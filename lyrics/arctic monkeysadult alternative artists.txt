Have you got colour in your cheeks Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the tide That sticks around like summat in your teeth Are there some aces up your sleeve Have you no idea that you're in deep I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week How many secrets can you keep 'Cause there's this tune I found That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee If this feelin' flows both ways  Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay That the nights were mainly made For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day Crawlin' back to you Ever thought of callin' when You've had a few 'Cause I always do Maybe I'm too Busy bein' yours To fall for somebody new Now, I've thought it through Crawlin' back to youI'm going back to 505 If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side With your hands between your thighs Stop and wait a sec When you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck Or I did last time I checked Not shy of a spark The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start I'm going back to 505 If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side With your hands between your thighsYou used to get it in your fishnets Now you only get it in your night dress Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness Landed in a very common crisis Everything's in order in a black hole Nothing seems as pretty as the past though That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco Remember when you used to be a rascal Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams Weren't as daft as they seem, aren't as daft as they seem My love, when you dream them up Flicking through a little book of sex tips Remember when the boys were all electric Now when she's told she's gonna get it I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it Clinging 'till I'm getting sentimental Said she wasn't going but she went still Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil I wanna be your vacuum cleaner Breathin' in your dust I wanna be your Ford Cortina I will never rust If you like your coffee hot Let me be your coffee pot You call the shots, babe I just wanna be yours Secrets I have held in my heart Are harder to hide than I thought Maybe I just wanna be yours I wanna be yours I wanna be yours Wanna be yours Wanna be yours Wanna be yours Let me be your 'leccy meter An' I'll never run out Let me be the portable heater That you'll get cold without I wanna be your setting lotion Hold your hair in deep devotion At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean I wanna be yoursI'm a puppet on a string Tracy Island, time-traveling Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches That come to find you four in some velvet morning Years too late, she's a silver lining Lone ranger riding through an open space In my mind when she's not right there beside me I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be And satisfaction feels like a distant memory And I can't help myself, all I Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine "Well, are you mine Are you mine Are you mine  Woah, ah I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days Great escape, lost track of time and space She's a silver lining climbing on my desire And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be And satisfaction feels like a distant memory And I can't help myself, all I Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine "Well, are you mine  Are you mine  Are you mine  Arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger And I ride it endlessly She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit And when she needs to shelter from reality She takes a dip in my daydreams My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind That little lady sittin' on the passenger side It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes As Arabella, oh As Arabella Just might've tapped into your mind and soul You can't be sure Arabella's got a '70s head But she's a modern lover, it's an exploration She's made of outer space And her lips are like the galaxy's edge And her kiss the colour of a constellation Fallin' into placeThe mirror's image tells me it's home time But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin'Carryin' your shoes Decided that once again I was just dreamin'Of bumpin' into you Now, it's three in the mornin'And I'm tryna' change your mind Left you multiple missed calls And to my message, you reply"Why'd you only call me when you're high ""Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high "Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite I need a partner,  well are you out tonight It's harder and harder to get you to listen More I get through the gears Incapable of makin' alright decisions And having bad ideas Now, it's three in the mornin'And I'm tryna' change your mind Left you multiple missed calls And to my message, you reply "Why'd you only call me when you're high ""Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high "You got the lights on in the afternoon An' the nights are drawn out long And you're kissin' to cut through the gloom With a cough drop coloured tongue And you were sittin' in the corner with the coats all piled high And I thought you might be mine In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night In the right place and time When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste And your knee socks Well, you cured my January blues Yeah, you made it all alright I got a feelin' I might have lit the very fuse That you were tryin' not to light You were a stranger in my phonebook I was actin' like I knew'Cause I had nothin' to lose When the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't comin' true Ain't it funny what you'll do One, two, three, four So you're on the prowl wondering whether She left already or not Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna Never knowin' when to stop Sunglasses indoors Par for the course Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls Cages and poles Call off the search for your soul Or put it on hold again She's having a sly indoor smoke And she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends Sippin' her drink and laughin' at imaginary jokes As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach And it seems as though those lumps in your throat That you just swallowed have got you going Come on, come on, come on Come on, come on, come on Number one party anthemAdvertise in imaginative ways, start your free trial today Come on in, the water's lovely Look, you could meet someone you like During the meteor strike, it is that easy Lunar
