Don't you know I care Don't you know that I'll be there As soft, as wide as air Climb to the stars Shine high up there And fall into your stare With all the colours I can wear I'd touch you if I dare And there'll be angels everywhere And when our body is bare And everything is soft and clear As close as we can bear And all our love goes everywhere And I know I could be lost And always too soon it's over But there's everything to feel And there's everything to discoverI feel those days without end When we used to be friends Those summer days were spent In search of hope and happiness We used to while away our days In a beautiful haze I guess I knew one day That you'd be moving long away You said go back to your dream Back to your wilderness Go back along the walk Maybe you'll find some happiness I wept a thousand tears for you For my love that came true And soon I realized I'd always dreamt it'd come to this And though that time passes by And that our lives have changed But our love was special Our love was strange And though my heart broke In time it did mend Except when I think about the time That we used to be friendsHere Love is in my arms Love along to stand the hard In the thought that ...Love is in my arms Herein Loving in my arms We could go from far to ...When you thought that love above The mysteries In the thought we live apart Love was in my arms..  one was all that leaves He ..  it falls In your ...Love Is like a game And all my ...And these sails change to winter Fall off again These tears Brushing up memories How I long to dream My sweetIf I could keep this moment here And never let it get away Then I would feel you close to my heart Shining, shining like a jewel...Like walking high on a wall And let's not fall, let's not fall Sweet dreams I remember it all I remember it all Do do do do do do do do Do do do do do do do do If I could keep this hour And hold it gently next to me Then it would sparkle like a jewel And always mean so much to me But now it's gone, it's gone too fast I wish it would never be in the past For then all our love wouldn't go to waste There would be no more screaming it awayShe's been making plans to go Hit the bright lights, hit the road To the city lights this time Just don't worry I'll be fine And she eats the food she bought Cause its colored with a thought But the thought could never know Its lonely and empty too She's been making plans to go Hit the bright lights, hit the road To the city lights this time Just don't worry I'll be fine And is it all because of you Everytime I look at you If I look back nevermind Just don't worry, I'll be fine Never look back, nevermind Just don't worry I'll be fine Never look back, nevermind Just don't worry I'll be fineDon't you know I care Don't you know that I'll be there As soft, as wide as air Climb to the stars Shine high up there And fall into your stare With all the colours I can wear I'd touch you if I dare And there'll be angels everywhere And when
