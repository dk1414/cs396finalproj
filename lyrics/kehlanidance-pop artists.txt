hallways I can see your smile It's what gets me through my hard days And your words were supposed to get me through my heartache Before my heartbreak There's an emptiness that only a few ever feel And I somehow missed the meaning of love that is real And it compliments my scars that will never heal Maybe I didn't deserve you Maybe I just couldn't cure you They told me that I didn't hurt you Why do I feel like I turned you Maybe I don't understand it Tell me is this how you planned it Did you see us so stranded Maybe I'm too much to manage And if you weren't gonna guide me Why bring me into the light Must have done something To make you want to run and hide Why, oh, why didn't you just live your life And every girl needs a mother And, damn it, I needed you Instead, you ducked for cover And you ran from the truth And like kids do, you waited around for proof
