me you don't find me attractive Look me in the heart and tell me you won't go Look me in the eye and promise no love is like our love Look me in the heart and unbreak broken, it won't happen It's love that leaves and breaks the seal Of always thinking you would be real Happy and healthy, strong and calm Where does the good go Where does the good go Where do you go when you're in love and the world knows How do you live so happily while I am sad and broken down What do you say  "It's up for grabs now that you're on your way down "Where does the good go, where does the good go Look me in the eye and tell me you don't find me attractive Look me in the heart and tell me you won't go Look me in the eye and promise no love is like our love Look me in the heart and unbreak broken, it won't happenI felt you in my legs before I ever met you And when I laid beside you for the first time, I told you I feel you in my heart and I don't even know you Now we're saying bye Bye, bye Now we're saying bye Bye, bye I was nineteen Call me I felt you in my life before I ever thought to Feel the need to lay down beside you and tell you I feel you in my heart and I don't even know you And now we're saying bye Bye, bye Now we're saying bye Bye, byeI don't wanna seem the way I do But I'm confident when I'm with you Lately, all I feel is bad and bruised Tired of tripping on my shoes But when he loves me, I feel like I'm floating When he calls me pretty, I feel like somebody Even when we fade eventually to nothing You will always be my favorite form of loving When I start to tumble from the sky You remind me how to fly Lately, I've been feeling not alive But you bring me back to life But when she loves me, I feel like I'm floating When shе calls me pretty, I feel like somеbody Even when we fade eventually to nothing You will always be my favorite form of lovingNo matter which way you go No matter which way you stay You're out of my mind, out of my mind Out of my mind, out of my mind I was walking with a ghost I said please, please don't insist I was walking with a ghost I said please, please don't insist No matter which way you go No matter which way you stay You're out of my mind, out of my mind Out of my mind, out of my mind I was walking with a ghost I said please, please don't insist I was walking with a ghost I said please, please don't insist No matter which way you go No matter which way you stay You're out of my mind, out of my mind Out of my mind, out of my mind Out of my mind, out of my mindI can't deny I'm begging for attention Dropping hints, hoping for some tension Getting tired of making all this racket Waiting on you to get your ass in gear I didn't wanna be so invested I played it cool and then I overdressed it You were there, I was tired of this Nonsense when you pretend you don't Get me, feel me, want me Like me, love me, need me Tonight, if you fuel my fire You can't stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh Stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh I tried, but you're fuel to my fire You can't stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh Stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh In a minute, I'll be hoping that you're outside Another second, you'll be walking on my wild side You know I'm ready for anything to happen Take this passion, turn it into actionBuild a wall of books between us in our bed Repeat, repeat the words that I know we both have said Relax into the need, we get so comfortable Remember when I was so strange and likable I just want back in your head I just want back in your head I'm not unfaithful but I'll stray When I get a little scared When I get a little scared When I get a little When I jerk away from holding hands with you I know these habits hurt important parts of you Remember when I was sweet and unexplainable Nothing like this person, unlovable I just want back in your head I just want back in your head I'm not unfaithful but I'll stray When I get a little scared When I get a little scared When I get a little scared When I get a littleI won't regret saying this This thing that I'm saying Is it better than keeping my mouth shut That goes without saying Call, break it off Call, break my own heart Maybe I would have been something you'd be good at Maybe you would have been something I'd be good at But now we'll never know I won't be sad But in case, I'll go there everyday To make myself feel bad There's a chance I'll start to wonder If this was the thing to do I won't be out long But I still think it better if You take your time coming over here I think that's for the best
