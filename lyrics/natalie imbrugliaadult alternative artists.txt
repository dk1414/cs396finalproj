I thought I saw a man brought to life He was warm, he came around like he was dignified He showed me what it was to cry Well, you couldn't be that man I adored You don't seem to know, or seem to care what your heart is for But I don't know him anymore There's nothing where he used to lie My conversation has run dry That's what's going on Nothing's fine, I'm torn I'm all out of faith This is how I feel I'm cold and I am shamed Lying naked on the floor Illusion never changed Into something real I'm wide awake and I can see The perfect sky is torn You're a little late I'm already tornI didn't want to be the one to forget I thought of everything I'd never regret A little time with you is all that I get That's all we need because it's all we can take One thing I never see the same when you're 'round I don't believe in him - his lips on the ground I wanna take you to that place in the "Roche"But no one gives us any time anymore He asked me once if I'd look in on his dog You made an offer for it then you ran off I've got this picture of us kids in my head And all I hear is the last thing that you said"I listened to your problems Now listen to mine"I didn't want to anymore And we will never be alone again Cause it doesn't happen every day Kinda counted on you being a friend Can I give it up or give it away Now I thought about what I wanna say But I never really know where to go So I chained myself to a friend Cause I know it unlocks like a doorCalling out, calling out Haven't you wondered Why I'm always alone when you're in my dreams Calling out, calling out Haven't you wondered Why you're finding it hard just looking at me I want you But I want you to understand I leave you, I love you Didn't wanna leave you with the wrong impression Didn't wanna leave you with my last confession, yeah Of love Wasn't trying to pull you in the wrong direction All I wanna do is try to make a connection, yeah Of love, yeah Yeah, mm Falling out, falling out Have you ever wondered If this was ever more than a crazy idea Falling out, falling out Have you ever wondered What we could've been if you'd only let me in I walk a mile with a smile I don't know I don't care where I am But I know it's all right Jump the tracks, can't get back I don't know anyone round here But I'm safe this time Cause when you tell me, tell me, tell me Stupid things like you do Yes I have to, have to, have to Change the rules;
