I woke face down in the sand Only remembering the holes in your hands You looked at me so fondly Although I walked away So can you teach me to dance Or tell me the number of stars in the sky I am a carcass lying in the roses Suffocating with each breath Turning the pedals into paper I’ll kill us all before I'm through Pull out my heart;Tear at my lungs so I don't feel this anymoreThis is the final curtain call; harvest these fields The composer is playing the finale Arms wide open Take me home Collect what’s yours This is what I've been waiting for I don't desire I don't want Recite, recite, recite...sing it again I don't want the blood of Adam But that is my curse The second hand is a hammer The hour won't pass you by Resurrect This is reckoning The slaying of injustice Jesus, whenever you are ready Come and take me home Welcome the apocalypse Forgive me, Father for I have sinned Lucifer, I'll be down again Hold my head inside my hands Is this part of some master plan Bite my lip and hold my tongue I am just a bastard son Sex and drugs and steal and lie My heart is anything but alive Oh, here comes the rain On my back in the blackest night I've tried my best to live this right Now sever my hands, cut out my eyes And lead me to the fields to dieI wanna see waves, upon waves, upon seas of blood Flood it all, let us down in a sea of blood It's a beautiful thing, this spinning globe But I'm not born of this and I'm a long way from home So I'll wait by the sea, to let the waves crash over me Cover the nation, make your presence know I want to see waves I have built my walls and drawn my lines Rise, rain down Can I get a hallelujah, right now Oh what a mouth you have It's such a sharp tongue It twists itself around lies, and tastes like alcohol You haven't moved in years Stuck in a coma state Well you better shake the dust off Cos tonight we're gonna dance You were always shy of the bright lights You looked much better painted in black and white But you got some red, on your party dress Did I sleep with your clone while you watched from the back door Trembling as I hit the back door...trembling as I We used to clean up so well We used to sparkle like diamonds We used to shimmer like gold We used to burn brighter than super novas Been searching for years in hopes To find a key but like a needle in a haystack I get lost in big cities My shoulders have grown weary from carrying both our weights So let me kneel by the water to regain my strength I thought that I was an ocean but you've drained me to a stream So if I can't save you, and life runs its course...Just know that you will be such a beautiful corpseOn your mark, light a spark This heart is fueled by cigarettes This heart is fueled by street lights You resurrect, we back down This world is a back drop so start to move Flesh eats away at flesh The taste of self defeat The symphony has fallen out of tune I've become "awaking heart" so sever what you don't need This world is a back drop so start to moveWake the sleeping, wake the sleeping The town is on its knees, the town is on its knees The city is surrounded by a nation that's holding guns Torches can light the path from the fields to the rivers Take the children to the sand; they don't need to see this Cast your spells swear by the stars Some cry for miracles Nightmares have been traded for dreams and you have buried all your angels No hands are free from blood, no hands All their stomachs are full They sold their souls for gold You've buried all your angelsYou wanna go for a ride The mirror came alive right before my eyes And now I'm standing at the same crossroads I've been one thousand times before It's funny how they say some things will never change So they must have seen this coming Just another angel wishing for halos Waiting on a miracle I gave up on romance, some time ago And by now I know she's not coming back She's not coming back Passion is not purifying but it passes the time My mind is like a broken clock in need of repair So I can finally be released from this moment Just another angel wishing for halos Waiting on a miracleMy mama said to me, "Darling, you've got your daddy's temper So you better watch your mouth, cause it'll lead you to the fire."I never did learn how to listen and I can't hold my tongue Now all the smoke is clearing from the shots ringing out And the water from the rivers will flow into the ocean Like my heart pumps the blood to the tips of my fingers Here's to the night...to my coma and my brand new set of eyes A corpse for a bride is dead in my hospital bed I don't need to write it down I don't need to spell it out Thank God these walls can't talk cause they could go on for days You don't know where I've been You don't know what I've seenPut me to sleep and let me wake up without a memory I cannot stand the eyes of judgment staring through me It's like lead on my chest, concrete around my feet A sword down my throat, and poison on my tongue Burn it off, the taste For too long my teeth kept secrets from escaping my tongue So bring your scalpels and cut away I cannot settle for mediocrity; it is a leech Burn it off I have no lover, I've buried them all I sleep on a blood soaked mattress, luke-warm Stripped away and cast into the fire was my innocence My reflection such a pale complexion that I hate I have no lover
