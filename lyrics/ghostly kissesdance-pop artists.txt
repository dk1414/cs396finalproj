How could I ever know you When everything lies in disguise How could I ever forget Those eyes looking for my weal How could I ever know more When everything is held by threat How could I ever feel you Once again, without losing my mind Oh empty note Shadows of my past Made it to the end Oh empty note Shadows of my past Made it to the end How could I ever know you When you are miles and miles away How could I forgive myself How blind and scared I was Oh empty note Shadows of my past Made it to the endBabe, what do you want to know We've already been over this A million times Wait, though I told you I would be There when you needed me Can't pretend to be someone else for you And I know, I know, I know, I know There is something missing Something that was always there before And I know, I know, I know, I know I'll still love you Even worlds apart The city holds my heart Within walls of glass and steel Can't you see I just can't go These walls are all I know The city holds my heart Like a shell I cannot feel surrounds I want you to go I'm scared to tell you soRunning fast, out of breathing Calling more than my own answer From where or when, I don't know In hope to meet you somewhere, or there I’m wasting all my will No worries for you, my dear I wander all my years This journey is not mine Faded roses in the backyard Reminding me of how long it has been Just a small place called our home With my heart, far from yours I’m wasting all my will No worries for you, my dear I wander all my years This journey is not mine Time is not on our side As you come and I go As I come back and it's too late You are already goneI felt this instant of desire Before I went back to my head And then I crawl back Into your arms Can it stay between us But we do not say such words Among the other things you know But we do not say such words In this endless "in between"But we do not say such words I will never learn, I know But we do not state such words We shared a moment of happiness Before the train pulls our hands And then I fall into pieces And then we fall into pieces Can it stay between us But we do not say such words Among the other things you know But we do not say such words In this endless "in between"But we do not say such words I will never learn, I know But we do not state such wordsMeet me where all wrongs turn to right Meet me where the light greets dark Where the lovers go when they are tired Keep me where you hide your second sight Deep inside where secrets start Where the lovers go when they are tired Let’s watch the last rays fading out Entwine our bodies on common ground Will you hold on my love Even in a time of trouble I want to hold on my love Even in times of trouble Will you hold on my love Even in a time of trouble I want to hold on my love Even in times of trouble Meet me where you can break the silence Meet me where the light greets dark Where the lovers go when they are tiredYou left without no goodbye in the night Walked out for miles, I'm not surprised You said it was not about you and I And I wish somehow Somehow you could stay Can you stay for a while Stay for a while just the way we are In the great divide Inside, I will know when to let you go Stay for a while just the way we are You left without no goodbye in the night Lost in a long forgotten dream You masquerade all you feel inside Wherever you go somehow you find ways To slowly keep on stealing Concealing love that is left behindI have to remember What it all means I need to see How it could be But baby tomorrow I'll be good enough to let you go Causing damages or not It is only for the night It will always be this one time Where you could play along with me Until I realise It is only for this one night More I deny It's all so real I don't want you to know What defines my being I don't want you to know What defines my being Causing damages or not It is only for the night It will always be this one time Where you could play along with me Until I realise It is only for this one nightTell me Where will you go now Can I follow you Can I follow you Tell me what you really want Show me how to drift where you are Where no one else has ever been before Will I ever be the one Who knows you more than anyone Like no one else has ever been before Never let me go I wanna know what lies ahead Ahead of us Never let me fall I wanna live up here Up here in your arms Please don't go now Stay where you are Please don't  go now Is that all When you move Under the moon I can feel you Slipping through to tantalize When you sing Your words soft and sincere Oh I want you More than I ever desired There are things I don’t understand Deep within my well Then I wish to unveil myself When I dance under your midnight prayer I dance around, around, around, in circles And I dance around, around, around, in circles In a dream Calm, surreal I can taste you Feel completely hypnotized When you speak The words I long to hear Oh I want you More than I ever desiredEvery day, I keep thinking About you and I How good we are together When we’re alone together Can you tell why Can you tell me why you keep your distance like this Can you tell me why you keep your distance like this I wanna feel your touch I wanna feel you I wanna feel your touch I wanna feel you Will you ever Will you ever let me in Let me in You read me well Better than I read myself I like I like you best When there is no one else, only on our own
