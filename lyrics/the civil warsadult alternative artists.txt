I never meant to get us in this deep I never meant for this to mean a thing Oh, I wish you were the one Wish you were the one that got away I got caught up by the chase And you got high on every little game I wish you were the one Wish you were the one that got away Oh, if I could go back in time When you only held me in my mind Just a longing gone without a trace Oh, I wish I'd never ever seen your face I wish you were the one Wish you were the one that got away I miss the way you wanted me When I was staying just out of your reach Begging for the slightest touch Ooh, you couldn't get enough, mmm Oh, if I could go back in time When you only held me in my mind Just a longing gone without a trace Oh, I wish I'd never ever seen your face I wish you were the one Wish you were the one that got awayYou only know what I want you to I know everything you don't want me to Your mouth is poison, your mouth is wine You think your dreams are the same as mine Oh, I don't love you, but I always will Oh, I don't love you, but I always will Oh, I don't love you, but I always will I always will I wish you'd hold me when I turn my back The less I give, the more I get back Oh, your hands can heal, your hands can bruise I don't have a choice, but I still choose you Oh, I don't love you, but I always will Oh, I don't love you, but I always will I don't love you, but I always will Oh, I don't love you, but I always will I don't love you, but I always will I don't love you, but I always will I don't love you, but I always will I always willDisarm you with a smile And cut you like you want me to Cut that little child Inside of me and such a part of you The years burn The years burn I used to be a little boy So old in my shoes And what I choose is my choice What's a boy supposed to do The killer in me is the killer in you My love, I send this smile over to you Disarm you with a smile And leave you like they left me here To wither in denial The bitterness of one who's left alone The years burn The years burn, burn, burn I used to be a little boy So old in my shoes And what I choose is my choice What's a boy supposed to do The killer in me is the killer in you My love, I send this smile over to you The killer in me is the killer in you My love, I send this smile over to youShe was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one Who will dance on the floor in the round She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round She told me her name was Billie Jean As she caused a scene Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one Who will dance on the floor in the round People always told me be careful of what you do And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts And mother always told me be careful of who you love And be careful of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth Billie Jean is not my lover She's just a girl who claims that I am the one But the kid is not my son She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side But who can stand when she's in demand Her schemes and plans'Cause we danced on the floor in the round So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice Oh, think twice She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine'Cause we danced on the floor in the roundIt's not your eyes It's not what you say It's not your laughter That gives you away You're just lonely You've been lonely Too long All your acting, your thin disguise All your perfectly delivered lines They don't fool me You've been lonely Too long Let me in the walls You've built around We can light a match And burn them down Let me hold your hand And dance 'round and 'round the flames In front of us Dust to dust You've held your head up You've fought the fight You bear the scars You've done your time Listen to me You've been lonely Too longDo I love you Oh, I do And I’m going to ‘til I’m gone But if you think that I can stay In this same old, same old Well, I don’t I don’t I’m gonna break things I’m gonna cross the line And make you wake up‘Cause you won’t I’m gonna name names I’m gonna call us out I’m gonna say it If you won’tI don’t want to talk right now I just want your arms wrapped around Me in this moment before it runs out Oh, don’t say that it’s over Oh, no, say it ain't so Let’s let the stars watch, let them stare Let the wind eavesdrop, I don’t care For all that we’ve got, don’t let go Just hold me I can’t pull you closer than this It’s just you and the moon on my skin Oh, who says it ever has to end Oh, don’t say that it’s over Oh, no, say it ain't so Oh, don’t say that it’s over Oh, no, say it ain't soRun, run, run away Buy yourself another day A cold wind's whispering secrets in your ear So low only you can hear Run, run, run and hide Somewhere no one else can find Tall trees bend and lean, pointing where to go Where you will still be all alone Don't you fret, my dear It'll all be over soon I'll be waiting here For you Run fast as you can No one has to understand Fly high across the sky from here to Kingdom Come Fall back down to where you're from Don't you fret, my dear It'll all be over soon I'll be waiting here For you For you For youQuand je marche dans la rue La rue vers le Sacré-Cœur Je me souviens des promesses Au nom de l’amour Je, je vais t’attendre là Viendras-tu pour moi Je vais t’attendre là Seulement toi Tu peux me tenir Jusqu’à ce que le soleil se cache Et embrasse-moi doucement Jusqu’à ce qu’il revienne Je, je vais t’attendre là Viendras-tu pour moi Je vais t’attendre là Seulement toi Tu prends peut-être du retard Tu as peut-être raté ton train Tu ne peux peut-être pas me pardonner Les ombres grandissent Et les foules s’effacentDrink up, baby, stay up all night The things you could do, you won't but you might The potential you'll be that you'll never see The promises you'll only make Drink up with me now, forget all about The pressure of days, do what I say And I'll make you okay, drive them away The images stuck in your head People you've been before That you don't want around anymore They push, shove and won't bend to your will I'll keep them still Drink up baby, look at the stars I'll kiss you again between the bars Where I'm seeing you there, with your hands in the air Waiting to finally be caught Drink up one more time and I'll make you mine Keep you apart, deep in my heart Separate from the rest, but I like you the best And keeping the things you forgot
