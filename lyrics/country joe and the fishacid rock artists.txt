plenty good money to be made By supplying the Army with the tools of its trade Just hope and pray that if they drop the bomb They drop it on the Viet CongThe white ducks fly on past the sun Their wings flash silver at the moon While waters rush down the mountain tongue My organs play a circus tune I dance to the wonder of your feet And sing to the joy of your knees The cold white dress on the mountain breast Paints the frozen trees The maple plants patterns in the sky Its leaves to kiss the wind While scores of glittering bugs and flies Dance polkas on her limbs I whistle symphonies of your face And laugh for your hair so fine In startled greens of playground grass A child jumps rope to rhyme Reeds and brass, the marching drums Make a joyous sound Trees bend low with nuts and plums Then fall to find the ground I hunger for your porpoise mouth And stand erect for love The sun burns up the winter sky And all the earth is loveI was stuck on an L A freeway Got rainwater in my boots My thumbs done froze, can't feel my toes I'm feeling a little thirsty, too Wheels throwin' water all over my axe And Mr  Jones won't lend me a hand Up come two cats in a Cadillac And they say won't you hop in, man I went flying high All the way All the way The one that's driving has got a Bowler hat The other's got a Fez on his head They turn around and grin and I grin back But not a word was said So I took out my harp and I played 'em a tune I could see they were diggin' it Then the one with the Fez, well he turns and he says We'd like to help you make your trip And I went flying high All the way All the way He said we can't leave him out in the rain He just might freeze and die So, why not put him on a plane And send him home in the sky So, they took me to the L A airport Laid twenty dollars in my hand Well, I paid my fare, I'm in the air Flyin' back home again And I went flying high All the way Yah, all the way All the way You know I went flying high All the wayLook, up yonder in the sky, now, what is that I pray It's a bird it's a plane, it's a man insane, it's my President L BJ He's flying high way up in the sky just like Superman But I have got a little piece of kryptonite Yes, I'll bring him back to land Said come out Lyndon with your hands held high Drop your guns, baby, and reach for the sky I've got you surrounded and you ain't got a chance Gonna send you back to Texas, make you work on your ranch Yeah, yeah, oh yeah He can call Super Woman and his Super Dogs But it sure won't do him no good Yeah, I found out why from a Russian spy That he ain't nothing but a comic book We'll pull him off the stands and clean up the land Yes, we'll have us a brand new day What is more I got the Fantastic Four And Doctor Strange to help him on his way Said come out Lyndon with your hands held high Drop your guns, baby, and reach for the sky We got you surrounded and you ain't got a chance Gonna send you back to Texas make you work on your ranch Yeah yeah, oh yeahHey partner, won't you pass that reefer round My world is spinnin', yeah, just got to slow it down Oh, yes you know I've sure got to slow it down Get so high this time that you know I'll never come down, I'll never come down I believe I'll go out to the seashore, let the waves wash my mind Open up my head now just to see what I can find Oh, yes you know I'm gonna see what I can find Just one more trip now, you know I'll stay high All the time, all the time Yes, I'll go out to the desert just to try and find my past Truth lives all around me, but it's just beyond my grasp Oh, yes you know it's just beyond my grasp I'll let the sand and the stars and the wind Carry me back, oh carry me back L.S.D L.S.D L.S.DMovin' down that rock coast line Oh, nothin' but my woman on my mind Hear those waves poundin' on sand Smell that sea air blowin' inland I wonder if she's found another man, oh!Black stone roadway by the sea Oh, I wonder if she's a-missing me Four-wheeled clock keeps tickin' off time Measured minutes by a broken white line Wonder if I'm really on her mind, oh And now in my thoughts I feel her eyes Feel her smilin' by my side Then I turn around and see There's nobody sittin' here but me, yeah!Rubber tired, oh lonesome song Tells me that I've done something wrong Days before and then we parted I wonder why I even started Thinkin' I've been gone far too long Moving past those rocks and waves I wonder how she spends her days Watch the sun as we go by Throwin' colors off the water sky Thinkin' about the rainbows in my baby's eyesBring flowers and ring them 'round her grass hair Bring leaves from the mountain and boxes of air Bring baskets of food and things you can share And the moon will shine in her eyes She will stand in the sea with her body like sand And the dolphins will come kiss the palms of her hands As she opens her soul to the water and land Her smiles will color the sky With bottles of light and sacks of clay With music to dance and songs to play With lemons and candles you'll see the way That the moon will shine in her eyes She will fly on the wind with her face to the sun Children will dance all around her for fun Just ask her for love and she'll give you some For her smiles will color the skyRed and swollen tears Tumble from her eyes While cold silver birds Who came to cruise the skies Send death down to bend And twist her tiny hands And then proceed to T AR GE T B In keeping with their plans Khaki priests of Christendom Interpreters of love Ride a stone Leviathan Across a sea of blood And pound their feet into the sand Of shores they've never seen Delegates from the western land To join the death machine And we send cards and letters The oxen lie beside the road Their bodies baked in mud And fat flies chew out their eyes Then bathe themselves in blood And super heroes fill the skies Tally sheets in hand Yes, keeping score in times of war Takes a superman The junk crawls past hidden death Its cargo shakes inside And soldier children hold their breath And kill them as they hide And those who took so long to learn The subtle ways of death Lie and bleed in paddy mud With questions on their breath And we send prayers and praisesSome people, they find each other I found you I found you I found you I found you I found you I found you
