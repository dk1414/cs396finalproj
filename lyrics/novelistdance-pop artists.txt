Stage 1: The initial period is one in which everything is new, exciting, and interesting for your students  It is fun for your students to explore their new environment.-from The Jesuit Handbook on Lycanthropic Culture Shock* * *At first, our pack was all hair and snarl and floor-thumping joy  We forgot the barked cautions of our mothers and fathers, all the promises we'd made to be civilized and ladylike, couth and kempt  We tore through the austere rooms, overturning dresser drawers, pawing through the neat piles of the Stage 3 girls' starched underwear, smashing light bulbs with our bare fists  Things felt less foreign in the dark  The dim bedroom was windowless and odourless  We remedied this by spraying exuberant yellow streams all over the bunks  We jumped from bunk to bunk, spraying  We nosed each other midair, our bodies buckling in kinetic laughter  The nuns watched us from the corner of the bedroom, their tiny faces pinched with displeasure."Ay Caramba," Sister Maria de la Guardia sighed  "Que barbaridad!" She made the Sign of the Cross  Sister Maria came to St  Lucy's from a Half-Way House in Copacabana  In Copacabana, the girls are fat and languid and eat pink slivers of guava right out of your hand  Even at Stage 1, their pelts are silky, sun-bleached to near invisibility  Our pack was hirsute and sinewy and mostly brunette  We had terrible posture  We went knuckling along the wooden floor on the calloused pads of our fists, baring row after row of tiny, wood-rotted teeth  Sister Josephine sucked in her breath  She removed a yellow wheel of floss from under her robes, looping it like a miniature lasso."The girls at our facility are backwoods," Sister Josephine whispered to Sister Maria de la Guardia with a beatific smile  "You must be patient with them." I clamped down on her ankle, straining to close my jaws around the woolly X XL sock  Sister Josephine tasted like sweat and freckles  She smelled easy to kill.We'd arrived at St  Lucy's that morning, part of a pack fifteen-strong  We were accompanied by a mousy, nervous-smelling social worker; the baby-faced deacon; Bartholomew the blue wolfhound; and four burly woodsmen  The deacon handed out some stale cupcakes and said a quick prayer  Then he led us through the woods  We ran past the wild apiary, past the felled oaks, until we could see the white steeple of St  Lucy's rising out of the forest  We stopped short at the edge of a muddy lake  Then the deacon took our brothers  Bartholomew helped him to herd the boys up the ramp of a small ferry  We girls ran along the shore, tearing at our new jumpers in a plaid agitation  Our brothers stood on the deck, looking small and confused.Our mothers and fathers were werewolves  They lived an outsider's existence in caves at the edge of the forest, threatened by frost and pitchforks  They had been ostracized by the local farmers for eating their silled fruit pies and terrorizing the heifers  They had ostracized the local wolves by having sometimes-thumbs, and regrets, and human children   Our pack grew up in a green purgatory  We couldn't keep up with the purebred wolves, but we never stopped crawling  We spoke a slab-tongued pidgin in the cave, inflected with frequent howls  Our parents wanted something better for us; they wanted us to get braces, use towels, be fully bilingual  When the nuns showed up, our parents couldn't refuse their offer  The nuns, they said, would make us naturalized citizens of human society  We would go to St  Lucy's to study a better culture  We didn't know at the time that our parents were sending us away for good  Neither did they.That first afternoon, the nuns gave us free rein of the grounds  Everything was new, exciting and interesting  A low granite wall surrounded St  Lucy's, the blue woods humming for miles behind it  There was a stone fountain full of delectable birds  There was a statue of St  Lucy  Her marble skin was colder than our mother's nose, her pupilless eyes rolled heavenward  Doomed squirrels gambolled around her stony toes  Our diminished pack threw back our heads in a celebratory howl-an exultant and terrible noise, even without a chorus of wolf-brothers in the background  There were holes everywhere!We supplemented these holes by digging some of their own  We interred sticks, and our itchy new jumpers, and the bones of the friendly, unfortunate squirrels  Our noses ached beneath an invisible assault  Everything was smudged with a human odour: baking bread, petrol, the nun's faint woman-smell sweating out beneath a dark perfume of tallow and incense  We smelled one another, too, with the same astounded fascination  Our own scent had become foreign in this strange place.We had just sprawled out in the sun for an afternoon nap, yawning into the warm dirt, when the nuns reappeared  They conferred in the shadow of the juniper tree, whispering and pointing  Then they started towards us  The oldest sister had spent the past hour twitching in her sleep, dreaming of fatty and infirm elk   When our oldest sister saw the nuns approaching, she instinctively bristled  It was an improvised bristle, given her new, human limitations  She took clumps of her scraggly, nut-brown hair and held it straight out from her head.Sister Maria gave her a brave smile."And what is your name " she asked.The oldest sister howled something awful and inarticulable, a distillate of hurt and panic, half-forgotten hunts and eclipsed moons  Sister Maria nodded and scribbled on a yellow legal pad  She slapped on a nametag: H EL LO, M Y N AM E I S_______  "Jeanette it is."The rest of the pack ran in a loose, uncertain circle, torn between our instinct to help her and our new fear  We sensed some subtler danger afoot, written in a language we didn't understand.Our littlest sister had the quickest reflexes  She used her hands to flatten her ears to the side of her head  She backed towards the far corner of the garden, snarling in the most menacing register that an eight-year-old wolf-girl can muster  Then she ran  It took them two hours to pin her down and tag her: H EL LO M Y N AM E I S M IR AB EL LA!"Stage 1," Sister Maria sighed, taking careful aim with her tranquillizer dart  "It can be a little over-stimulating."* * *Stage 2: After a time, your students realize that they must work to adjust to the new culture  This work may be stressful and students may experience a strong sense of dislocation  They may miss certain foods  They may spend a lot of time daydreaming during this period  Many students feel isolated, irritated, bewildered, depressed, or generally uncomfortable.Those were the days when we dreamed of rivers and meat  The full-moon nights were the worst  Worse than cold toilet seats and boiled tomatoes, worse than trying to will our tongues to curl around our false new names  We would snarl at one another for no reason  I remember how disorienting it was to look down and see two square-toed shoes instead of my own four feet  Keep your mouth shut, I repeated during our walking drills, staring straight ahead  Keep your shoes on your feet  Mouth shut, shoes on feet  Do not chew on your new penny loafers  Do not  I stumbled around in a daze, my mouth black with shoe polish  The whole pack was irritated, bewildered, depressed  We were all uncomfortable, and between languages  We had never wanted to run away so badly in our lives; but who did we have to run back to  Only the curled black grimace of the mother  Only the father, holding his tawny head between his paws  Could we betray our parents by going back to them  After they'd given us the choicest part of the woodchuck, loved us at our hairless worst, nosed us across the ice floes, and abandoned us at the Halfway House for our own betterment Physically, we were all easily capable of clearing the low stone walls  Sister Josephine left the wooden gates wide open  They unslatted the windows at night, so that long fingers of moonlight beckoned us from the woods  But we knew we couldn't return to the woods; not till we were civilized, not if we didn't want to break the mother's heart  It all felt like a sly, human taunt.It was impossible to make the blank, chilly bedroom feel like home  In the beginning, we drank gallons of bathwater as part of a collaborative effort to mark our territory  We puddled up the yellow carpet of old newspapers  But later, when we returned to the bedroom, we were dismayed to find all trace of the pack musk had vanished  Someone was coming in and erasing us  We sprayed and sprayed every morning; and every night, we returned to the same ammonium eradication  We couldn't make our scent stick here; it made us feel invisible  Eventually we gave up  Still, the pack seemed to be adjusting on the same timetable  The advanced girls could already alternate between two speeds, "slouch" and "amble." Almost everybody was fully bipedal.Almost.The pack was worried about Mirabella.Mirabella would rip foamy chunks out of the church pews and replace them with ham bones and girl dander  She loved to roam the grounds wagging her invisible tail   We'd give her scolding pinches  "Mirabella," we hissed, imitating the nuns  "No." Mirabella cocked her ears at us, hurt and confused.Still, some things remained the same  The main commandment of wolf life is Know Your Place, and that translated perfectly  Being around other humans had awakened a slavish-dog affection in us  An abasing, belly-to-the-ground desire to please  As soon as we realized that others higher up in the food chain were watching us, we wanted only to be pleasing in their sight  Mouth shut, I repeated, shoes on feet  But if Mirabella had this latent instinct, the nuns couldn't figure out how to activate it  She'd go bounding around, gleefully spraying on their gilded statue of St  Lucy, mad-scratching at the virulent fleas that survived all of their powders and baths  At Sister Maria's tearful insistence, she'd stand upright for roll call, her knobby, oddly-muscled legs quivering from the effort  Then she'd collapse right back to the ground with an ecstatic oomph  She was still loping around on all fours , her fists blue-white from the strain  As if she were holding a secret tight to the ground  Sister Maria de la Guardia would sigh every time she saw her  "Caramba!" She'd sit down with Mirabella and pry her fingers apart  "You see " she'd say softly, again and again  "What are you holding onto  Nothing, little one  Nothing."Your eyes tend to remind me so frequently The cold and distant light of these heavenly bodies I know too well that I’m the only one to blame, I’m sorry I knew where we’d be led but I just kept walking Now, I see the light, the fire devouring the coal Now I’m used to singing with the monster I’ve become To dream of the gold in the river Oh, the nights have become longer to stand And the dawn is harder to wake each day These nights have stolen the best And what is left should never be yours I’m fading with the gleam of a far-off firmament My soul weeps an ocean I can’t seem to drain I’m drowning in these waters Sink as deep as I can sink I know too well that I’m the only to blame I’m sorry I knew where I’d be led I’ve spent my whole life Dreaming of a brighter light But I doubt you can ever realize That all these songs to call-off the jinx Might be everything this world has left meI'm trying to survive these strange days This life can be such an adventure The world stands before my eyes Wilder than it has ever been I forgot these old memories of youth That were caught right under the surface Forgot these souvenirs of you That were calling back the pain I never felt happy somehow But I'm trying, I'm trying the best I can I really wanna feel happy sometimes Really wanna know where the lights are But it only feels so wrong It's eating me alive I never know how to shorten the distance Between my heart and my head'Cause through my eyes, the days are monochrome I wanna feel the light of a new day But I'm so scared of it all...I'm scared this utter joy ain't lasting forever It's eating me aliveI've been hearing you murmur about a thousand times The minutes are running like rabbits and I'm chasing words It's almost midnight You're probably already sleeping The sandman by your side So we'll meet in our dreams I've been far, for so long I swear, soon I'll be home If my heart is cold wrap it up please, warm me up I see the miles pass one by one on the rear-view mirror;Driving, 'til the night's end, foot on the gas Leaving all the rest behind It's 5am and I'm miles and miles away from home Frozen Following the signs along the road I've been far, for so long I swear soon, I'll be home If my heart is cold wrap it up please, warm me up I see the miles pass one by one in rear-view mirror;Driving, 'til the night's end, foot on the gas Leaving all the rest behindI cannot explain this feeling I'm having When I'm looking at these pictures yellowed by the sun This weird emotion is sticking at my soul It numbs me to the bones These moments are battles I can't win Everything that I love is killing me And these lies won't save me any longer I've destroyed one by one every beloved thing Right before my own eyes, slowly but surely One day I'll be part of the ghosts on your photographs And you'll forget about me when other ones come You will replace one by one every memories They will fall away and merge in the afterglow I cannot explain this feeling I'm having When I'm hearing these hearts singing burdened by their dirge This weird emotion That's echoing with my soul is all I ever fearedLet's go I know I can't define this life I know you can't see through these answers I’m seeking for a way too deep to be found My life's reflected through the wet film of my eyes I've been betraying the kid that I was Do you think this life really deserves an anthem ?I’ve been changing It reminds me when I was younger and useless My heart beats, covered in bruises I saw this room slowly turn to a coffin As locked in, but I'm not dead yet I did my best to show you that i've been changing And what I've been through to see clearly through myself Through myself I was such a mess before this I don't miss it, no, I don't miss it My heart has braced itself I'll set this world in check I finaly found myself I've got my dreams and all my memories in my head I don't wanna be the one who can live without this All that I can see is the distance since these days I wouldn't recognize myself without the mess of what I've done with my lifeShe imprisoned my soul in a bottle Like a firefly And threw it again to the fire She drew me that life on a vacant canvas But she's gone with its colors We're playing a duet But the melody of melancholy seems to be the only thing we share Tell me the secrets of her fantasy How could I believe in this heaven that she promises She's calling my name in my dreams I can't hide Oh she's in the walls, and she never falls asleep I feel her presence In these streets, in my house In these thoughts that I have With her cloak and her big black scythe This sharp taste of iron doesn't really leave Like calling her ghost through the mirror I'm painting my life on this vacant canvas with my own blood She's calling my name in my dreams I can't hide Oh she's in the walls, and she never falls asleep I feel her presence In these streets, in my house In these thoughts that I have With her cloak and her big black scytheIt comes in like a cold wind The spirit of the world we live in I'm holding a wave Go give it away 'cause Are we looking for the answers Or are we dropping to our knees and giving in I'm running again Stop running away 'cause Stop running away 'cause I feel exiled inside of my head Existing through this vivid dream Say that I'll feel the same Say that I'll feel the same But it's now or never And I keep running away I keep running away So I'm chasing the joie de vivre Not really knowing how it works I'm holding on a dream Even if everything around me collapses Even if everything around me collapsesWas it all just a dream or Was it just the price to pay Now I'm left here to pray in silence And you got what you wanted I search for meaning when all I used to do was dreaming Disconsolate, mourning a loss, lonesome at best Run away, but I can never escape from the pain in my brain This fucking misery I need a reason for who we are I need to breathe throughout the war I lost faith in myself again I lost faith in myself again Just breathe in, just breathe in And bury me, bury me Just pretend, just pretend And run away, run away I can't dеny, that all I do is losing control You know I can't keep going on, this shit is taking its toll But I can never escapе, but I can never escape, fuck But I can never escape, system failureI'm so scared of living my life in vain I'm always always craving for better vibes My hands are rough, my soul is heavy...But they've always held me down When my whole life was going south The three last years might have changed my life forever Now I just wanna break free from these towering walls To get this grey out of my mind'Cause when I'm here alone with the silence, I can't feel whole No, I can't feel whole You know The road has always been the same But the world is changing I am lost Lost amongst the days I'm living I'm dreaming of a brighter way I've placed my heart on an altar Have set my soul ablaze In hope to save me from myself Oh you know we may walk under different welkins But when I'm drowning in your eyes
