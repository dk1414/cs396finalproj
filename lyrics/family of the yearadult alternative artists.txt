Let me go I don't wanna be your hero I don't wanna be a big man Just wanna fight with everyone else Your masquerade I don't wanna be a part of your parade Everyone deserves a chance to Walk with everyone else While holding down A job to keep my girl around And maybe buy me some new strings And her a night out on the weekend And we can whisper things Secrets from our American dreams Baby needs some protection But I'm a kid like everyone else So let me go I don't wanna be your hero I don't wanna be a big man I just wanna fight like everyone elseAll the boys and all the pretty girls Summertime, I'm gonna make you mine And all the fun to shine on everyone Summertime, I'm gonna make you mine Summertime, I'm gonna make you mine It gets dark, you watch them fall Then it gets light, then it gets louder Watch them bloom, watch them blossom, they grow higher Not here forever, but for now, let's do whatever And then never even find something that's close to being better Then you fall into its arms, you got bare feet out in the barn And you know that whatever, there will never be no harm All the boys and all the pretty girls Summertime, I'm gonna make you mine And all the fun to shine on everyone Summertime, I'm gonna make you mine Summertime, I'm gonna make you mine So much sand stuck inside my shoe We watch a thunderstorm, kill an afternoon We feel no pain, go swimming in the rain Two hearts that were apart are now the sameYou're a moonlit kiss A drop of blood A burning bridge I showed you money You don't know what it is You're raw honey You're a broken bone You're the dark abyss below Cold and sunny, blind by the snow You're raw honey You're raw It's a drag being bad But it's all that you have When your heart is a mess And you need something to confess It's a drag being bad But it's all that you have You're an open book You're the first Drugs you took Far above me How does it look You're raw honeyGrowing up without a dime It was so damn fun Mom worked overtime And Dad was gone And I know it's not easy Now I know I'm not easy Ride around the neighborhood With my older friends Go to sleep whenever I want And burn it down Oh, I know I wasn't easy Now I know I wasn't easy I don't blame you for things we never did Or bad things I've done I don't blame you for things we never did Or bad things I've done She was lost He was gone It was right I could do whatever I wanted He was lost She was gone It's alright I could be whatever I wantedWhats your name summer girl Will you stay until september comes And takes it's sun from your blonde hair Whose your type summer girl Who'll hold you tight till the fall comes And your life takes you away I remember seeing you Before the summer sun touched your pale skin And now you're golden And sitting round the fire with my friends What's your name summer girl Will you stay until september comes And your life takes you away Whose your type summer girl Who'll hold you tight till the fall comes And takes it's sun from your blonde hair All the loneley winter days Crust and brake around like autumn waves And massachussets base And guess cast out to sea and gone for goodWho sleeps in beds when you've got the sunrise Wasting time watching informercials live on channel 9 Us and Billy Mays, nowhere else to rile Stealing blankets, sleeping in a pile They made the sunrise for people like us So we have an excuse as to why we're still up Just so we can feel a little bit better About the neighbor's angry letter on our door step On our door fucking step Went to the house of some friends that I just met Didn't feel okay so I bought some cigarettes Tonight everyone's with everyone else getting it on I'm alone asleep with my clothes on Maybe still awake They made the sunrise for people like us So we have an excuse as to why we're still up Just so we can feel a little bit better About the neighbor's angry letter on our door step On our door fucking stepWhen you feel like No one loves you And the world seems nothing but against you I Wanna feel like someone you can talk to The two of us there's nothing we can't get through'Cause in the end In the end In the end Like a friend you can depend on When the night seems darker than ever I wanna break the day together When the rain comes falling and you're stranded I'll help you shuffle the cards that you were handed'Cause in the end In the end I'm your friend You can depend on You can lie You can cheat You can run and still be great You can lie You can cheat You can hurt someone and still be sweet We run around spendin' most of our lives Tryin' to have a good time Just to stay in the light Woooh I wanna break this thing with all that we have And we'll give it a shot'Cause you're all that I've got Woooh In the end I am your friend When you're broken into pieces I'll get your car and take it to the places Where we park high above the city Where the lights sparkle so pretty'Cause in the end In the end I'm your friend You can depend on You can lie You can cheat You can run and still be great You can lie You can cheat You can hurt someone and still be sweet We run around spending most of our lives Trying to have a good time Just to stay in the light Woooh I wanna break this thing with all that we have And we'll give it a shot'Cause you're all that I've got Woooh In the end In the end I am your friendA girl sleeps on the island Her hair is long and brown Hidin' from the winter Dreaming of another town You didn't end up in the city Like all the years before Now you're just another Girl who washed ashore Showin' off your diamond Blazin' in the car Dreaming of the summer'Cause summer's just too far You didn't end up in the city Like all the years before Now you're just another Girl who washed ashore You broke up with your boyfriend He threw out all you had You're tryin' not to call him But you get drunk insteadDo you wanna know How far I've come and how far I'm willin' to go Do you wanna see Who I've been and who I'm gonna be Even though I need a little more love I need a little more time You know I've gotta let it go I've gotta let it go I need a little more love I need a little more time You know I've gotta let it go I've gotta let her go Do you wanna try Maybe meeting somewhere up in the sky And I'll be there Telling you we never should've said goodbye Even though I need a little more love I need a little more time You know I've gotta let it go I've gotta let her go I need a little more love I need a little more time You know I've gotta let it go I've gotta let her goA little violence A little thunder Old me is better now Off in the distance We used to climb The wall in the garden To get the ball from Mr  Harding Now I'm just like you Hanging out with the dead end blues How do I forget about you Hanging out with the dead end blues I'm dreaming of another life Where the good girls cry I'm goin' down to Mexico to get a butterfly knife I'm dreaming of another life Where we left behind Everything that kept us in the place We swore we'd never die I'm dreaming of another life
