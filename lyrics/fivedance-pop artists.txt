It's like a jungle sometimes It makes me wonder how I keep from going under It's like a jungle sometimes It makes me wonder how I keep from going under Broken glass everywhere People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care I can't take the smell, can't take the noise Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice Rats in the front room, roaches in the back Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far'Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge I'm trying not to lose my head Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh It's like a jungle sometimes It makes me wonder how I keep from going under Standing on the front stoop, hanging out the window Watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow A crazy lady livin' in a bag Eating out of garbage pails, used to be a fag hag Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango A zircon princess, seemed to lost her senses Down at the peep show watching all the creeps So she can tell her stories to the girls back home She went to the city and got so, so saditty She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her ownIt's like a jungle
