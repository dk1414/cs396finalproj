Watch your mouth, hold your tongue boy Because you're running out of breath Running out of time before every careless word That you utter, renders you utterly useless Now you're drowning in your own saliva Trying to speak yourself to the top of your empty world Well keep on talking, just keep on rambling You've got your mouth full Listen, here's the pleasant part You and I, we fell apart Listen, here's the pleasant part You and I, we fell apart  Why can't you make up your mind Shut your mouth, burn your bridges Throw your words like an attack and Stab me in the, wait a second, wait a second What's that I just heard  Nevermind It's obviously worthless Now you're standing on your soapbox Yelling from the rooftops Everything you say is a lie A lie, a lie, lie, lie, yeahWe're at the top of the world You and I We've got a lot of time And it sure feels right'Cause you reached in your pocket And pulled out a pass That says you can take me anywhere Sha la la la Sha la la la Sha la la la la Sha la la la Sha la la la Sha la la la la Sha la la la Sha la la la Sha la la la la Sha la la la Sha la la la Sha la la la la We're on the top of the world Here tonight We've got a lot of time And it sure feels right'Cause I'm up here running behind you I'm up here running in repeatDad, your boy is about to fall He walks the razor's edge He's on the brink of fading out He's at his bitter end Dad, your boy, he used to run You taught him how to crawl He left home to find his own Now, all he had is gone In your eyes, I see a darkness that torments you And in your head where it dwells I'd give you my hand if you'd reach out and grab it Let's walk away from this hell Mom, your baby's on his way He'll soon be at your side'Cause he's forgotten all he's known A part of him has died Mom may never understand Why baby's come and gone He left home to find his own Now, all he has are liesHere's a thought, if you're willing to listen I only tell the truth of the feelings I'm given Can you hear me now  Listen Whispers in the rain  Listen Don't push love away, You know you do It's all we have It's a chore holding onto a vision Don't leave her high and dry She's the one you'll be missing Can you hear me now  Listen Whispers in the rain, while you're awake Don't push love away, you know you do It's all we have I hate to think hesitation's a burden A bittersweet design for a lesson you're learning Can you hear me now  Listen Whispers in the rain, while you're awake Don't push love away, you know you do It's all we have She's crying  She's crying  She's crying  She's cryingDid you really think that it was over When you hung up the phone And said goodnight And did you ever think that it would be too much I can't leave without saying goodbye So did you really think that you could take it Could you make it alone tonight I never could have hoped for anything more Be my angel if you can, alright You always say goodnight And you always say goodnight So baby did you sleep an hour for me How I wish I was there right now I wasn't going to tell you I could change things I'm afraid I never will know how But I don't really think that I can take it Will I make it alone somehow So hold me in your arms before I leave you I'll be back as soon as time allows You always say goodnight And you always say goodnight GoodnightWe knew you'd hate this before we wrote it So listen up, we're telling you before you tell us We're not misinformed or misdirected Functioning on your subjective Your hatred only fuels us on Check it out Now how about a word or two on you You're an alias, an email address We lay a lot more out than you do You do  You do!We won't be part of your revolution So listen up, we're telling you this is a business We're not misinformed or misdirected We'll make our own insurrection So keep on publishing our wrongs Now how about a word or two on you You're a paper fist, a faceless attack We're not about to break like you doYou took away all my anger We put away all your pride Now you're gone It's plain to see we're nothing Now you're as the solitude of space is Chorus:We took it all away from you You'd like to think you made us We took it all away, away You let us know that we are nothing You took away all our pleasure We took away all your pain Now we're gone it's plain to see you're nothing Now you're as the solitude of space is Chorus:Nothing without you  Nothing...  Nothing without you Chorus:Cause Something isn't right here You've gone and left me on the ground Something isn't right in this world called confusion You gave it all away before you could lose it Something isn't right here on the ground You never said goodbye You died You chose to carry on a lie Something isn't right here You've gone and left me on the ground Something isn't right here You're gone and left me on the ground Something isn't right in this world called confusion You gave it all away before you could lose it Something isn't right here on the ground  Something isn't right in this world called confusion You gave it all away before you could lose it  Something isn't right here on the ground  Hold on, don't speak the word "surrender"Won't sink toward defeat I know when you're on a bender That you're just searching for peace And how a heavy heart always weighs you down It's hard to breathe at night with no one around So I'll stay by your side, never let you down So that you never drown So can you hold out 'Cause it is getting better now, hold on It is getting better now It is getting better now, hold on Even though you don't know how It's gettin' better and better and better, so hold on Trust everyone got issues Just creeping underneath Hush secret sleeping demons No one even sees them But you can show yours to me Yeah, I know it'd be easy to shut me out But I hope you can see when you're crying out That you can count on me when you're losing count And I'm standing closest when you're at your lowestHere is my new disposition You're about to understand Our theory is only obvious To the skeptical And at the bitter end You're staring at a white page And the print is plain to see Now turn the page and read what's written It's your history Do you understand Chorus:The dream is over You haven't slept in years Don't be looking for answers You're better following trails The dream is over You haven't slept in years Don't be looking for answers You're better following trails You're staring at a black screen Your body starts to tense When two plus two Is five or less It's time to question common sense Silence is a secret A weapon in disguise Listen to the silence  Open up your eyes Do you understand
