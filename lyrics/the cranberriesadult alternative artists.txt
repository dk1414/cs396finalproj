standing there Do you notice, do you know Do you see me, do you see me Does anyone care Unhappiness where's when I was young And we didn't give a damn Cause we were raised To see life as fun and take it if we can My mother, my mother She'd hold me She'd hold me when I was out there My father, my father He liked me, well he liked me Does anyone care Suddenly, something has happened to me As I was having my cup of tea Suddenly, I was feeling depressed I was utterly and totally stressed Do you know you made me cry  Do you know you made me die And the thing that gets to me Is you'll never really see And the thing that freaks me out Is I'll always be in doubt It is a lovely thing that we have It is a lovely thing that we It is a lovely thing The animal The animal instinct So take my hands and come with me We will change reality So take my hands and we will pray They won't take you away They will never make me cry, no They will never make me dieThere's no need to argue anymore I gave all I could, but it left me so sore And the thing that makes me mad Is the one thing that I had I knew, I knew, I'd lose you You'll always be special to me Special to me, to me And I remember all the things
