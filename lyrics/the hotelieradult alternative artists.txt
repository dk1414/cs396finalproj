"So while you're fixing up your bed So while you’re organizing drawers Could you just listen to the problems had With problems of yours And what’s that note you’re writing there Why are you giving me this back This was a gift from when we met Back when you weren’t so upset"I called in sick from your funeral The sight of your body made me feel uncomfortable I couldn’t recognize your shell Your branching off had met an end From all the weight that made you bend And when you tried to shed your leaves You pined for warmth as they said“Your lack of love for your dear self Is sapping all of us here out!Trace your roots back to the ground Work out the knotholes for yourself”I called in sick from your funeral The sight of your family made me feel responsible And I found the notes you left behind Little hints and helpless cries Desperate wishing to be overOpen the curtains, singing birds Tell me, "Tear the buildings down"You felt blessed to receive their pleasant Sound of things that break Make you cringe inside yourself There's a child counting stars in their time Out of their day In the corners of their frame They are encased in the losing of A grain of themselves Pushed against the ebb and flow Wave good-bye and watch it go Well, show me the honest, proper way Disarm predatory gaze Sucking dry never satiated You've been misused Been rewired, you're short Circuiting now, just remember when You'd call me to come Take a deep breath and then jump So fragile are bodies, so concave Work in self-destructive waysYou were born on a leap year, fill in the gaps Spinning gears, keep catching your cracks Skipping teeth, keep calling you back Telling stories pretending they’re fact Let me go, too unstable to wane Chewing wildflowers to numb the pain Cut the lines, you’ll be fine But if you break when I break, will you carry me away Will you fall on your blade just to hear when I’m saying I can’t You came out, started bruising Find it tough to admit when you're losing Oh, what should I think Carefully crafted commercial disaster They take what you’re after To get what they want out of you Cut the lines, you’ll be fine But if you break when I break, will you carry me away Will you fall on your blade just to hear when I’m saying I can’t You cut your ties, felt better off Salutations to your son Awoke to find you heading out With your white collar undone You placed a bar, I played a game To see how low that I could go We develop mental pictures And we’re following our fathers down the drain Do you recall the imagery From when I drove you away Through others’ rose prescription lens Man, I’m sorry every day Because we intersect internally And then we take what we have and we run And it all starts to unravel Until we’re less than we were carrying before Guess I expected more Wake me, wake me up Pictures of you smiling in times When I just couldn’t be around Hold me, hold me up Count my rings to see how many winters I’ve been stuck here underground Swore I’d not burn out Digging through the memories that Made you feel alive when you were young You were right to doubt Broken since foundations in the Structures you were building came undoneWell we called off your guard as we entered the yard To convince you to redirect some of that rage Because who fed you rocks while they ate their thanksgiving And who left you out all alone in their cage And when you were a pup, well I watched you so close You ran straight to the distance allowed by his post You got kicked, you got choked, phrases crept up your spine When he said, "We must keep our bitches in line"And on his poker nights, says the same of his wife He's the top dog, pack leader, a true alpha-male So make no sudden moves, keep your nose from the border You move fast, you eat last this side of pecking-order So why don't you come with me  We've got acres with streams We won't keep you in cages, make you beg for your treats We won't tell you to heel, though you might need some time to Dig up those old bones your young self left behind You said, "Your offer is nice but here should suffice Yeah, my younger years were something but that isn't my life Master's all that I've got, he keeps me having a purpose Gives me bed, keeps me fed, and I'm just slightly nervous of What I might do if I were let loose If I caught that mail car or ate garbage for food So, as I bare all my teeth I will ask of you please to just leave."Well, you fell for The first option presented of new rebirth You couldn't see it, but you Thought you'd believe it, since your Soles cramping up have been swollen and sore Your new shoes back then just don't fit anymore You retraced the same shape, cut up and re-sewn When you felt abandoned, when you felt alone When you felt alone And on New Year's You resolved to make your chaos external Duress of sickening kinds A half year blacked-out of my mind No string traced back to a place--Marker alleviate Erase failed attempts at obstructing machines Got drained when the crutch became vampiracy Bit off more than could chew and then swallowed it whole I choked on your temper when you felt alone When you felt aloneYou cut our ropes, left the umbilical And now I carry around this weight of broken hope And I can’t retrace, and I lost my hold And blame myself 'cause that is all I’ve ever known And your face shows doubt When your head feels the wake of the sorrow Swore to me that you could live without Then the beg turns to take turns to borrow Help me down, I just want this out When you bend, when you break, when you follow So you cut me out Then you cut our ropes, left the umbilical And now I’m lost, and I can’t take this path back home Send a birthday card, leave a one-way note I lied, I’m sorry, this isn’t easy, I don’t know And you’d ask me to“Open your walls to this”But I’m scared, fingers broken And ill-prepared to let this drag outI tried to keep a steady hand Tumble blocks, start again I held your side when you let go And you came back well-rehearsed in holding your own A broken seal, a past self known Retrieve my heart from Alamo I need it here to touch your skin Reconfigure, deconstruct, and begin The centers shrunk between your eyes Sharper corners, broader sides And I felt weak in woman's wear Genderfucked, dilated, stuck holding a stare You taught me how to guard my self To keep my heart unscathed in health I think you got carried away Reached out your hand..  it carried you away Well, it's life in drag Well, it's life in drag You wore an armor that covered your face It's life in drag I wore hands high to show truce and embracing It's life in dragYou carry an illness Practically know it by name It seldom speaks for you You learned to tune it away But it wasn’t easy Was fond of your writing It allowed me to see into you You hid behind the similes Like fractal light in all shades of blue Pebbles and mirrors I’m just Jealous because I tried mapping out your mind’s Inconsistent ways, tangled and untied I watched your ends start to fray, you felt Buried from the start, tearing you apart Constricting the free beating of your heart I knew your postcard would say“Wish you could stay, wish you felt the same way”The icons cluttering your bureau Are eyeing me as I walk in Your guardians are present in here And I trust that they have always been Hiding somewhere in your closet Collecting moisture from your face Your secret world speaks without words And I feel clumsy and cumbersome in this place But if I want them too, will they speak to me soon In a language ripe for my listening When the harsh sun breaks in your stained glass eyes The refracted light keeps glistening A drapery of clashing fabrics In every corner of your room They hung like lace on the whitewashed face Of the walls that are begging you to move And leave the things that hold a history As if they're present in your will A brand new place a few miles away But I just wasn't sure I was staying still But if you choose this too, it's an honest move And I guess that it makes for no deferences There's a gleam of blue from a cold night's moon Just a touch too soon, two deliverances
