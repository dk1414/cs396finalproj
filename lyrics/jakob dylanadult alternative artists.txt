Well, I made a promise to not let go Our tug of war has only made me want you more Now steeped in hard luck and doomed to roam My love is braver than you know My forefathers, they worked this land And I was schooled in the tyranny of nature's plans And dressed in thunder, a cloud came around Oh, in the shape of a lion, a hand came down Now, damn this valley and damn this cold Well, it takes so long to let me know It's plant, and reap, and plow, and sow But tell me, will it grow Dig my ditches in the golden sun And I'd be robbing these trains if I could catch me one Now, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday's gone And got me stone-cold sober in a drought so long Boarded mansions and ghost-filled yards Now, there's a boy in a water-tower counting cars Steel trap open and empty stalls Now, there's a well-worn saddle, but the horse is goneI got my window open wide I got my window open wide I got a good woman by my side Got a good woman by my side Now, this kind of day has no night Yeah, this kind of day has no night And I ain't got much on my mind Now, I ain't got much on my mind'Cause I know something good this way comes Now, watching the streets filling up I'm watching the streets filling up In the shade of the summer sun In the shade of the summer sun Got sweet apple pie on the stove Got sweet apple pie on the stove The birds, they're all flyin' low The birds, they're all flyin' low'Cause they know something good this way comes Yeah, something good this way comesThere's a world where I can go and Tell my secrets to In my room In my room In this world I lock out all my Worries and my fears In my room In my room I do my dreaming and my scheming Lie awake and pray Do my crying and my sighing Laugh at yesterday Now it's dark and I'm alone But I won't be afraid In my room In my room In my room We'd feel much better If we sunk this treasure And we laid our armor down Now, these precious metals These captain's letters Are no use to us now Oh, in the day, we struggle with fatigue Much greater than any offer was We bow down and worship These bandits and cowboys Unable to hold their own guns Now, I know that soldiers are not paid to think But something is making us sick Onward and steady, able and young In the valley of the low, low sun Oh, in the shade, we wander Along a highway shoulder Out into the back of beyond Burning the daylight Into a pastime That's too wise to come more than once Oh, it's boom, boom, thunder Ain't no sleep coming out Mining a slippery world Of snow covered beaches Junkyards of diesel And bombers named after girlsI been walking the dirt floor, my eyes are open Lord Where did you go, have we just left you bored On down this unholy well we rolled Stirring barrels in hell to be warm It's further back down than the high ground It ain't milk and honey we're moving 'round Only one thing is certain And that's everybody Everybody's hurting Now we come from the country where the rain follows plow And the evenings are cold enough to pluck your feathers out We hear your engines roaring deep and loud As we work the mules on this bludgeoned ground We've hunted these hills dry We've long outlasted the winter and our last wood pile Only one thing's certain And that's everybody Everybody's hurtingMother, you saw my eyes On the Fourth of July Under a banner of Roman candles Mother, war is kind Like hell, but I am fine Brother, have you gone west You followed through once yet You are still younger, how dare you forget Brother, war is best In the morning, when you've had rest Like a lost dog between houses In the unknown open country You line up at dawn to see who's missing My age is a metaphor That only speaks of everything before Daughter, you wear my name Those are my eyes, keep 'em raised I may have scars but I give more than I take Daughter, war is safe Where you are far awayNothing but the whole wide world to gain Nothing, nothing Got nothing but the whole wide world to gain Nothing, nothing Got nothing but the whole wide, whole wide world to gain I'm here on the blacktop, the sun in my eyes Women and country on my mind Bolting me out over the borderline Now there's no more love lost and no more shame No more digging holes or graves Nothing to lose but rivets and chains Got nothing but the whole wide world to gain Nothing but the whole wide world to gain Nothing, nothing Got nothing but the whole wide world to gain Nothing, nothing Got nothing but the whole wide, whole wide world to gain Was born in a stable and built like an ox Down in the pastures I learned how to walk Mama, she raised me to sing and just let 'em talk Said no rich man's worth his weight in dust Bury him down same as they'll do to us God wants us busy, never giving up He wants nothing but the whole wide world for usEvery time I see you smile Now, come to me, now don't be long Let me tell you how my heart goes wild Please let me love you and it won't be wrong Every time you're in my arms Come to me, don't be long You know that I'll never do you harm Please let me love you and it won't be wrong Let me love you and then you'll see Now come to me, come to me Let me show you once and we'll be free Please let me love you and it won't be wrong Now every time I see you smile Now come to me, don't be long Let me tell you how my heart goes wild Please let me love you and it won't be wrong Let me love you and then you'll see Come to me, come to me Let me show you once and we'll be free Please let me love you and it won't be wrongI was born in the summer of Sam Smaller and sooner than planned Oh, in the spitting image of a man Raised by wolves on the fat of the land Clear romance beauty and damned Tomorrow will come if she can Just want a woman who can walk on a wire With a trembling glass in her hand Over the hilltops, the fire engine rolls Down the valley, deeper still, it goes Got my weapons out, and I'm laying low On this end of the telescope Alone, you ramble the whole of the world Through black water jungles for bliss Well, it's feast or famine, you eat what you kill There's no need to bring God into this My heart is heavy and pressed to the bone Some people too heavy to hold Now, salutations, take me as I am You can have me or leave me aloneDown from the mountain out walking the flood I see the future in this setting sun Unfolded gardens uncover the earth as it was Filled with canteens and tear gas from this last voyage of us Ain't no gentlemen here hiding wings The devil himself would be puzzled to give Any reasons to sink his fingers in All this voodoo and black magic doing the work that was his With battle songs filling their lungs Move them out down under the sun Give 'em tears for cherry red blood Stack 'em old, we cradle them young World is crazy or maybe just holy rollers for love Now split this ocean set these sails It's down to the seabed we dazzle and fail Hereafter's bringing more funerals than fairs And it's a book of blank maps that we're using to get us there Now through the hilltops my daughter, my son The rescue's too little to cover the slums Cross this river deeper than it ever was There's a pause in the evening when prayers are supposed to be done
