I, I believed memory might Mirror no reflections on me I, I believed that in forgetting I might set myself free But I woke up this morning With a piece of past caught in my throat And then I choked I, I bled I tried to hide the heart from the head And I, I said I bled In the arms of a girl I'd barely met And I woke up this morning With the present in splinters on the ground And then I drowned And if I can't see It's for want of you You said "I see"If there's nothing here then its probably mine Well, my, my turn to see If there's nothing here it will always be mine, mine But I woke up this morning With a piece of past caught in my throat And then I chokedCaught in time so far away From where our hearts really wanted to be Reaching out to find a way To get back to where we'd been And if summer left you dry With nothing left to try This time...Caught at a distance from myself And there was no one there to know What could I do What could I do I have learned sometimes a need can run too deep And we throw away the things We most wanted to keep And inside we lie over and over again This time...Caught at a distance from myself And there was no one there to know And there was no one there to know What could I do If you don't know you'd better learn to believe me When I say I'm going to build a wall around this town Around these hearts and hands If you don't know you'd better learn to believe me When I say I'm going to build a wall around this town Around these hearts, these hearts and handsI'm going down, going down Deeper than inside The world is my fuse And once inside, I'm gonna tear'Til there's nothing left to find And you wonder just how close Close-up can be Can't you see  Can't you see I had a dream, all my thoughts They turned to real lips And the world is my fuse And just a dream, just a dream Can bring me to my knees And you wonder just how tight Skin-deep can be Can't you see  Can't you see I'm going down, going down Deeper than inside The world is my fuse And from inside, outside Just can fall apartIâ€™ve had days, of end on end Where nothing changed and nothing ever began Restless movement in an empty room Gathering shadows of a darkened blue And oh, it feels so strange Oh, it feels so strange When it comes again Cycles of end on end Edges begin to blend Time, following time A pattern becomes defined I had a feeling from end to end Tried to catch it before it started again Pushed it away to force a laugh But inside I didn't have the breath And oh, it feels so strange Oh, it feels so strange When it comes againDrink deep It's just a taste And it might not come this way again I believe in moments Transparent moments Moments in grace When you've got to stake your faith Why do I confine When all I want is release It moves outside you It stays inside you And it's not something that I could prove Or could choose to be moved Yes, it's a promise and it's a threat And it's not something that I'll let you forget Not just yet, not just yet Why do I chase when all I want is near If it's not the rule then it's always the case Good intentions get fractured Good intentions get replacedI read somewhere that Every wall's a door to something new Well, if that's true Why can't I get through Cause I'm not who I thought I was And I can't explain No, I can't explain No, I can't explain Yeah, but it feels like I'm falling through a hole in my heart Just, just falling through a hole in my heart Don't try to reach for nothing at all I could walk around Fall in love with a face or two But it wouldn't be you No, it wouldn't be you Cause you're not who I thought you were No, I can't explain No, no, I can't explain But it feels like I'm falling through a hole in my heart Just falling through a hole in my heart Don't try to reach for nothing at allIt's more than love And it's less than love It's what I gave to you It's more than love And it's less than love It's what I gave to you You All there is is the knowing That this never had to end, no All there is to know If I could take Heart in hand What I'd give to you If I could take Heart in hand What I'd give to you You All there is is in the knowing That this never has to end All there is to know That this never had to endI want to talk Like I'm talking to myself I want to reach I could be someone else And when a touch When a touch becomes too much You know, I could be someone else And I, I know enough not to hope to know But it's so hard'Cause the night can fill my eyes And you give me some distance I can get so hard to find And when a word When a word cuts in too close I can always get so hard to find And I, I know enough Not to hope to know It was so clear To have not been clear at all I got so far to have come against a wall The first, the final, no middle Well it seems so real to me To each is own illusions If I could only, I only believeCruelty is the better part of your honesty And when you're so direct It's just for yourself to protect And if I started crying Yeah, would you start crying And if I started crying Would you start crying And sometimes when I see a world inside Sometimes when I...You know I try And hope is just another rope To hang myself with To tie me down Something real comes around And if I started crying Would you start crying Now I started crying Why are you not crying Sometimes when I got a world inside And sometimes when I...I try, I really tryI was the champion of forgive forget But I haven't found a way To forgive you yet And though I know you and I are through All my thoughts are lines converging in on you I wish sometimes The mind were blind what must be seen what can't be real what's done is done It goes on and on I am the victim of a persistent vision It tracks me down with it's precision And though I know you're not in my eyes I can't seem to clear you from my mind I wish sometimes The mind were blind what must be seen what can't be real what's done is done It goes on and on
