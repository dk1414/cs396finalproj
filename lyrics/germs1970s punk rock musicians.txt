looking through communist eyes I'm seeing planes in bloodshot skies I see the flag of a working people Who conceal the lies in the stars and sickle It's a double edge It's a doubld edge Communist eyes, come on inside I can't ever find the way out Communist eyes, lost inside I never get a day out I'm looking through communist eyes All I see is an old man's alibi There's a world outside but I'm unaware I open up my books but the pages stare It's a double edge It's a double edge Communist eyes all so blind I can't even play the game now I'm living through communist times I wave my flag and hold my head high I can feel the glory of my comrades in masses But I'm waiting for the day when this madness passesStanding in the line we're aberrations Defects in a defect's mirror We've been here all the time, real fixations Hidden deep in the furor What we do is secret Secret!We're influential guys for the D.C.C We can lie so perfect Got a party line to every call It's a very short circuit What we do is secret Secret!Licensed to drill with the torch in our lives Walking on shallow water Progressed to the point of no distinction Dementia of a higher order What we do is secret Secret I'm Richie Dagger I can stomp and swagger I can take on all your heroes I'm Richie Dagger I'm young and i'm haggard The boy that nobody owns He sits in his corner like a child despised A crazy sort of cast comes over his eyes-That's Richie Dagger's crime He's that sort of boy that was never much loved His idea of fun was society's grudge-That's Richie Dagger's crime His life was such a mess And his friends weren't quite the best But he was satisfied-That's Richie Dagger's crime Suck me in and spit me out Devour me in haste-I'm Richie Dagger I can stomp and swagger I can take on all your heroes I'm Richie Dagger I'm young and i'm haggard The boy that nobody ownsI take it anywhere, any time that I can I am the fucking son of a superman I got a weapon that's as deadly as life It's a well trained tool a master guy Every day it's the same, regime A dozen girls are on my scene Say sex boy will you come Into my hand They're all on the floor I better do what I can Take a number, it's

like you, and you, and you And youI came into this world like a puzzled panther Waiting to be caged But something stood in the way I was never quite tamed I crossed the paths of right and wrong -And saw them take their toll I saw armies that marched And like animals they crawled I came into this world like a puzzled panther Wanting to be caged But something stood in the way I was never quite tamed Evolution is a process too slow To save my soul But I've got this creature on my back And it just won't let go If I am only an animal Then I can do no wrong But they say I'm something better So I've gotta hold onLand of treason, waste no reason We are breathing fire We're packs of dogs, we're enemies of men We are not desired Our faces show we've grown cold But have not conspired Old hearts gone, the future's on Mother nations mired Like a receptacle for the chosen dead We find our bodies clawed And with the scent of death We find that we are not so very awed Loyalties burned, the words our blurred Overturn your own Walk like dogs and watch the doors Have your other stone Stop the toys that march disordered Calculate the thrones Feel the pulse descending Decaying hallowed tomes In the starving sense you worship The nations of debris You wear a coat of sewage That you've never even seenI'm a lexicon devil with a battered brain Searching for a future, the world's my aim, so
