Went down to Saint Tropez Where Renoir paints the walls Described you clearly But the sky began to fall Am I ever gonna see your face again Am I ever gonna see your face again Trams, cars and taxis Little waxworks on the move Carry young girls past me But none of them are you Am I ever gonna see your face again Am I ever gonna see your face again Without you near me I got no place to go Wait at the bar Maybe you might show Am I ever gonna see your face again Am I ever gonna see your face again I've got to stop these tears That's falling from my eye Go walk out in the rain So no one sees me cryHe went away, and you hung around And bothered me every night And when I wouldn't go out with you You said things that weren't very nice My boyfriend's back, and you're gonna be in trouble When you see him comin' better cut out on the double You been spreading lies that I was untrue So, look out now cause he's comin' after you He's been gone for such a long time Now, he's back and things'll be fineWent down to Saint Tropez Where Renoir paints the walls Described you clearly But the sky began to fall Am I ever gonna see your face again Am I ever gonna see your face again Trams, cars and
