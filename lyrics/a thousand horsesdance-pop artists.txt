She comes rolling right off the tip of my tongue so easy She'll be the first damn thing I want when I start drinking I'm breathing her in, breathing her out, once I pick her up I can't put her down She's smoke I pull her in nice and slow She's a habit and I can't let go Blowing rings around my heart The one she stole Watching her sway and go It's killing me and I know Can't stop her once you start She's smoke She'll go floating around like a downtown ballroom gypsy She goes great with ice cold beer or a shot of whiskey Put one in my hand, her on my lips Man, that's as good as it gets She's smoke I pull her in nice and slow She's a habit and I can't let go Blowing rings around my heart The one she stole Watching her sway and go It's killing me and I know Can't stop her once you start She's smokeGirl, don't hang up I called on purpose Yeah, I've had a few Hell, I'm hurting Our song came on the radio I could hear you singing along So I took the long way home So I could listen to it all Sounds like Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh It sounds like Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh This ain't no drunk dial Ain't no words that I'm forgetting In the morning Still mean everything I said I know it's late and I ain't called in awhile But this ain't no drunk dial We ain't got to talk about what happened But I'll take the blame If you want me to have it Somewhere in this full moon night There's a way to make this whole thing right If you leave the front door open I'll be there before you know itI ain't perfect No I never claimed to be And I'm still workin' on a better side of me Sometimes I drink too much Sometimes I smoke and cuss I work hard to play hard hell like everybody does But I took the long way every lesson I learned And I gotta scar to show for every stripe that I've earned But looking back can't help but laugh at all the pages I've turned No worries it's just water under the bridges I've burned Yeah I've been real close I've even said those three words And everybody knows when you take it back it hurts Every little white lie, every bullshit fight It started the fire when the flames got higher Just stew up two and smoke the tires But I took the long way every lesson I learned And I gotta scar to show for every stripe that I've earned But looking back can't help but laugh at all the pages I've turned No worries it's just water under the bridges I've burnedWhen my road runs out You're gonna find me with my lead foot down Rear view mirror, ripped off the windshield Regrets nowhere near When my blood runs cold And it don't matter if I'm young or old Cause when it's all said and done I’ll be long gone with the sun They're gonna know that I was here Gonna bang that drum, gonna light it up Every bullet in the gun Shot across the midnight sky Ain't leavin' one behind Love even if it hurts Even if I crash and burn All the way down to the embers Leave them something to remember Might be glory, might be flames When the good lord calls my name Stand my ground, run from nothin'I'm going out in a blaze of somethin'I’m gonna come on strong Like there's no tomorrow comin' on Enjoy the good times while you've got 'em'Cause who knows how long you've got 'em Raise your glass and sing alongI'm either all in or all out I'm in the wooden pew Sunday party crowd If no one else will drink it then you know I will And wake up in the morning with some Baptist guilt Every tattoo's got a story to tell Mama said she's prayin' hard to keep me outta hell But whiskey tastes better when you chase it with a beer But I ain't telling nothing new to nobody here If I'm preachin' to the choir Raise your hands a little higher If you wanna sing along to a Saturday night revival song Let me see you sparking up your lighters Pour a little payday on the fire If you're a forty drinking, forty working, living the dream Then you're just like me And I'm preachin' to the choir Preachin' to the choir I ain't rich but I'm grateful Every time I'm driving with a tank full"Simple Man" coming through the dashboard speakers I'm a southern rock sinner, believerGirl Just a small town girl world Just a small town girl Dreams I know you got your dreams But you're not here with me Am I still in your dreams One way town With no way out It's holding you in And it's holding you down But I'll be the one Who will set your heart free If you come back to me Boy Just a rebel boy Raising hell, making noise Just a rebel boyTail lights don't lie Didn't even have to say goodbye Can't go home, so I'll just stay here Find a way to make you disappear Take a shortcut to the jukebox To a barstool and a double shot I'm smokin' even though I quit I need a song to remember And a drink to forget I'm on my way to gettin' over you But I ain't there yet When the melody hits me Little Coke in my whiskey I'm as close to good as I'm gonna get I need a song to remember And a drink to forget Song has faded, glass is empty Halfway to okay that you ain't here with me I can't decide if I miss you tonight Or I'm glad that you're gone, hell, I guessYour love tells a story baby Well I've been reading between the lines lately The first page down rip it out and roll it up I burn it like a star falling down to the earth I always seem to love the things that kill me Take your sticks and stones 'cause they don't break me Leave your guns at home this ain't a Western baby I am gonna die by your suicide eyes Slide high on the cleaving baby You look up and say jump Whose gonna be the one to save me Gonna die right here, ain't nobody gonna miss me'Cause everybody think I'm crazy Take your sticks and stones 'cause they don't break me Leave your guns at home this ain't a Western baby I am gonna die by your suicide eyes Take your sticks and stones 'cause they don't break me Leave your guns at home this ain't a Western baby I am gonna die by your suicide eyes Take your sticks and stones 'cause they don't break me Leave your guns at home this ain't a Western baby I am gonna die by your suicide eyes Take your sticks and stones 'cause they don't break me Leave your guns at home this ain't a Western baby I am gonna die by your suicide eyesThe rule is simple It's as good as gold

them to be kind to youI was drifting through nothing Playing strings in the back of this bus I was searching for something Not sure who or what it was Sometimes I get lonely But I know she's leaving this house I keep on rolling Through another life And another town Got my aviators And my cigarette lighter And my leather jacket I'm a jet fighter Like a long haired hippy Age seventy-seven I'm a bat out of hell Just searching for heaven Ain't insane, I'm out of plans Some people can't stand a traveling man Alright
