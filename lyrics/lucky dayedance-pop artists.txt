We don't know what we’re made of The same thing we're afraid of might improve us Stay up all night, just lay up Use half of this pay stub to make moves with Or all of it, of course And it ain't no room in Paris We could still fly high, then crash here Just make sure you pass it No, you can’t imagine Ooh, it's automatic The life we live is lavish We don't have to be here if we stay We don't have to leave if we go Roll some mo'And we ain't too high if we see eye to eye Know you feel the rush from a simple touch Baby, roll some mo'Through some kissin', lifted up through your vision Got me on my knees, you’re my religion Speak in tongues all on your body, no one’s listenin'Tap out on you, that’s a submission, know you give in Can't let no time go wasted This moment can't replace it Sittin' around so lazy Comfortably, we’ll fade awayHmm Guess I got lot of pride So much pride I don't, I don't see myself being hurt but Guess it happens to everybody, hmm Yeah, it feels the same, yeah, every day I wish that I could travel through time to get right back to it Ha, it's funny how pain work And no matter how bad you wanna get out of it The next person gotta deal with it It's fucking my head up, hmm And you wanna, make me feel, what you feel, hmm Like I hurt you that bad Alright good luck, we ain't the same But I'm the one to blame I've been dealin' with the pressure Way too much to even measure Try to keep it all in But you got me open, hopeless for you Oh-oh, hopeless for you, hey, oh-oh I can't afford those losses That's just my ego talkin'You make my heart beat for you I almost cry too often But I put too much in your hands So much regret in the end It's a shame for you, it's a shame for me Is the blame on you  I can say the same for me After the wrong is there a right How can I look into your eyes This is a truth that I can't fightOoh, ooh, ooh-ooh, oh Good and plenty like a Georgia peach tree, big and sweet Tweak behind the scenes, runnin' down your knees Water floodin' me , feelin'-feelin' I tipped my tea, I looked over to the left I think we should let it rain tonight Know I love it when we slip and slide Don't stop lovin', got enough supply Sleep, wake up then repeat You'll get every little bit You ain't never seen a drip like this Heaven at your fingertips Don't you let a minute slip Just say you'll havе me Oh, taste and see Hope you don't sleep  on me I've got good and plenty Inhabit all the spaces in-between It's magic when I taste your inner being An average day is spent all in the sheets Emphatic when I tell you what you mean to me Chemistry, intimate memories Every time I give you all my energy Emphasis, never sleep Babe, say somethin', we should be ashamed Don't say names, I don't wanna know No care for the blame games Watch it fall, fall, fall Can't hit me when you rain so loud Flood away Speak into the mic, baby You can't seem to tell me what you need from me What make you wanna fight lately So naive to believe you in it for us My emotions been straight up too long Lies get bogus, life's the focus, I know Stone cold You make seasons change with no fair warning How you make seasons change without saying something  Oh All these reasons I give lead you to running Don't leave me out in the cold without my warm thang Should've made you feel more important Now I'm up all night drinkin' poison'Til my thoughts are all distorted The only way I know to ignore it Tryna hide all the pain Just to go back to what it was for us'Nother bottle, I'm all poured out Flood, flood awayYou've been channelin' energy Sendin' it to me, right on the line Ooh yeah, you know you're fine And somehow you find the time to wine and dine your bitches better than me Ooh, this shit is trash But I'ma give it right on back 'cause that's what I've been gettin' from you, ooh, ooh Yeah, lately You've been out on the block actin' crazy, doin' your thing And then you turn around and blame it on the moon Just 'cause you're feelin' blue, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh How much can a heart take Whеn feelings change like phases of thе moon Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh You found me in a hard space, hey, hey, ayy, ayy You say you're done here No
