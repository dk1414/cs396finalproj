Take me now, baby, here as I am Hold me close, and try and understand Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe Love is a banquet on which we feed Come on now, try and understand The way I feel under your command Take my hand, as the sun descends They can't hurt you now Can't hurt you now Can't hurt you now Because the night belongs to lovers Because the night belongs to us Because the night belongs to lovers Because the night belongs to us Have I doubt, baby, when I'm alone Love is a ring, a telephone Love is an angel disguised as lust Here in our bed 'til the morning comesThese are the days Oh These are days you'll remember Never before and never since, I promise Will the whole world be warm as this And as you feel it You'll know it's true That you are blessed and lucky It's true, that you are touched by something That will grow and bloom in you These are days you'll remember When may is rushing over you with desire To be part of the miracles you see in every hour You'll know it's true, that you, that you are blessed and lucky It's true, that you are touched by something That will grow and bloom in youHey Jack Kerouac I think of your mother And the tears she cried, they were cried for none other Than her little boy lost in our little world that hated And that dared to drag him down Her little boy, courageous Who chose his words from mouths of Babes got lost in the wood Hip flask slinging madmen, steaming cafe flirts They all spoke through you Hey, Jack Now for the tricky part When you were the brightest star Who were the shadows Of the San Francisco beat boys You were the favorite Now they sit and rattle their bones And think of their blood-stoned days You chose your words from mouths of Babes got lost in the wood The hip flask slinging madmen, steaming cafe flirts In Chinatown, howling at nightThe color of the sky as far as I can see is coal gray Lift my head from the pillow and then fall again With a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather A quiver in my lips as if i might cry Well by the force of will my lungs are filled and so i breathe Lately it seems this big bed is where i never leave Shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather Quiver in my voice as i cry What a cold and rainy day Where on earth is the sun hid away I hear the sound of a noon bell chime, i'm far behind You've put in 'bout half a day while here i lie With a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather A quiver in my lip as if i might cry Do i need someone Here to scold me or do i need someone Who'll grab and pull me Out of this four poster dull torpor Pulling downward It is such a long time since my better days I say my prayers nightly this will pass away The color of the sky is gray as i can see through the blinds Lift my head from the pillow and then fall again With a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather A quiver in my voice as i cryThe man in 119 takes his tea alone Mornings we all rise to wireless verdi cries I'm hearing opera through the door The souls of men and women, impassioned all Their voices climb and fall; battle trumpets call I fill the bath and climb inside, singing La-la-la, la-la-la La-la-la, la-la-la He will not touch their pastry But every day they bring him more Gold from the breakfast tray, I steal them all away And then go and eat them on the shore La-la-la, la-la-la La-la-la, la-la-la La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la I draw a jackal-headed woman in the sand Sing of a lover's fate sealed by jealous hate Then wash my hand in the sea With just three days more I'd have just About learned the entire score to Aida Holidays must end as you know All is memory taken home with me The opera, the stolen tea The sand drawing, the verging sea All years agoMmm la la, yeah yeah yeah Oh oh oh Hey, hey That young boy without a name Anywhere I'd know his face In this city, the kid's my favorite I've seen him, seen him I see him every day I've seen him run outside Looking for a place to hide From his father, the kid half-naked And I said to myself"Oh, what's the matter here "I'm tired of the excuses everybody uses He's their kid, I stay out of it But who gave you the right to do this We live on Morgan Street Just ten feet between and his mother I never see her, but her screams and cussing I hear them every dayTrouble me Disturb me with all your cares and your worries Trouble me On the days when you feel spent Why let your shoulders bend underneath this burden When my back is sturdy and strong Trouble me Speak to me Don't mislead me, the calm I feel means a storm is swelling There's no telling where it starts or how it ends Speak to me Why are you building this thick brick wall to defend me When your silence is my greatest fear Why let your shoulders bend underneath this burden When my back is sturdy and strong Speak to me Let me Have a look inside these eyes while I'm learning Please don't hide them just because of tears Let me Send you off to sleep with a"There, there, now stop your turning and tossing"Let me Know where the hurt is and how to heal Spare me Don't spare me anything troublingDon't talk, i will listen Don't talk, you keep your distance I'd rather hear some truth tonight Than entertain your lies So take you poison silently Let me be, let me close my eyes Don't talk, i'll believe it Don't talk, listen to me instead I know that if you think of it Both long enough and hard It's the drink you drown your troubles in Is the trouble you're in now Talk, talk, talk about it You talk as if you care But when your talk is over Tilt that bottle in the air Tossing back more than your share Don't talk, I can guess it Don't talk, well now you're restless and You need somewhere to put the blame For how you feel inside You'll look for a close and easy mark and You'll see me as fair gameO, baby blankets and baby shoes Baby slippers, baby spoons, walls of baby blue Dream child in my head Is a nightmare born in a borrowed bed Now I know lightning strikes again It struck me once, then struck me dead My folly grows inside of me I eat for two Walk for two Breathe for two now Well, the egg man fell down off his shelf All the good king's men with all their help Struggled 'til the end For a shell they couldn't mend You know where this will lead To hush and rock in the nursery For the kicking one inside of me I eat for two Walk for two Breathe for two nowYou win a prize for that For telling lies like that So well that i believed it I never felt cheated You were the chosen one The pure eyes of noah's dove Choir boys and angels Stole your lips and your halo In your reckless mind You act as if you've got more lives In your reckless eyes You only have time and your love of danger To it you're no stranger In that august breeze Of those forgotten trees Your time was set for leaving Come a colder season In your reckless mind You act as if you've got more lives In your reckless eyes It's never too late for a chance to seize some Final breath of freedom
