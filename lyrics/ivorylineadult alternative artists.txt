failure is beneath him Yes, he will deliver; failure's not an option Our complacency won't last much longer An urgency will sweep, sweep, sweep Our sleep, sleep, sleeping hearts Our complacency won't last much longer An urgency will sweepThis town is dirty Honey, even for a girl like you Where the game is lets play fake And the players, all the religious and the scoundrels -One in the same  Oh what a shame What an absolutely terrible shame There are liars outside your window There are liars outside your window Singing syncopated rhythms drowning in your ear And they're all you ever, all you ever, ever hear Your apathy says blame for this, uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh, yeah Apathy says blame me for this Oh, day two is quite the same In fact just the name, woah lets change face And the players, all the religious and the scoundrels Meet in the shady place today What a terrible shame There are liars outside your window There are liars outside your window Singing syncopated rhythms drowning in your ear And they're all you ever, all you ever, ever hear Your apathy says blame for this, uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh, yeah Apathy says blame me for thisAre we, are we just selfish Wanting to keep you where we are Just where you left us You're seeing all the things I'd die to see Everybody finds it necessary To say how much You loved me As if I didn't know so deeply Can you see evidence of perfection Look past the circumstance And find some meaning Find some meaning If only this song could capture The peace you are seeing If only this song could capture The hope we are seeking Everybody finds it necessary To say how much you loved me As if I didn't know so deeply Can you see evidence of perfection Look past the circumstance And find some meaning Find some meaningO Holy Night  The stars are brightly shining It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth Long lay the world in sin and error pining Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn Fall on your knees  Oh, hear the angel voices!O night divine, the night when Christ was born;O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!Led by the light of faith serenely beaming With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;In all our trials born to be our friends He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger Behold your King  Before him lowly bend!Behold your King  Before him lowly bend!Truly He taught us to love one another His law is love and His gospel is peace Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother And in his name all oppression shall cease Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we With all our hearts we praise His holy name Christ is the Lord  Then ever, ever praise we His power and glory ever more proclaim!His power and glory ever more proclaim All the wretched things I've done are now submerged in blood Who is responsible for all of this love It's true We cannot live Without forgiveness I try So hard to live above the world's selfish lies That give me more and more, a greed-sick list We still store Our treasures here So easily destroyed The final time I close my eyes I will open them in paradise Now, I realize I am nothing but bone Made from dust, someone learning to love Like You do Eternally, always true I want To be nothing more than a man wholly Yours A beloved son, one who You hold close To your heart Eternally, never apartMaybe this time, no, next time We'll get our lives right, we'll get it right Or will we just do what feels good Though we know it could 'cause our souls to drown In all the distractions of our lives What does it mean to be Salt and light in a world that's tasteless Salt and light in a world of darkness What does it mean to be Salt and light in a world that's tasteless Salt and light in a world of darkness Insecurities are breeding  inside of me And they wanna choke our song But they won't last against the sword's edge The blade, the blade cuts right through wrong All the distractions of our lives
