Oh, listen up Young man, there's a—there's a young man, he writes stories He's a writer, a little writer boy He falls in love with a girl, girl already has a boyfriend She kinda loves him back, but not really They're just really good friends, and that's fine He understands, it's rational Hi, what's your name  How are you  How’s your life Oh, you got a man  Are you in love  If so, what type Is it just platonic, strictly just as friends Or the type that ties you two together 'til tomorrow’s end If it is, disregard every time I call you pretty Though it’s meant sincerely, it’s just my imagination drifting Brush me off like the dirt on Jay-Z’s shoulders So I fall to ground, collect myself and get ready to take over your heart Or at least your spare time And I love the thought of being with you Or maybe it’s the thought of not being so alone!Hey, the second one’s way sadder than the first one But I don’t know I love the thought of being with you Or maybe it’s the thought of not being so alone!The second one’s way sadder than the first one But I don’t knowUgh...Oh, that's my shit right there That's the ticket, gimme the ticket Give it to me baby You know it!I'm too emotional Good luck to my future wives and their future lives without me You guys will do great I'm sure that I've prepared you for every guy you'll date And every guy you'll marry and every guy you'll hate It's the lullabies I sang out of tune, that's probably what did it Or my twin size mattress that I had since I was 7 That we have to sleep on whenever she spends the night And if she falls off again, she'll find another guy to like We're just Romeo and Juliet But getting drunk and eating Percocets But just to ease the stress But soft, what light through yonder window breaks It is the east, but Juliet just puked off the balcony"Hi," says the girl with the right eyes That pairs pretty well when she hits you with the soft smile You can kinda tell that something's going on, but She's like a Skrillex song that never drops She'll never talk, she'll never talk about the feelings that she felt today Better kept inside of a fence, inside of a cage, inside of a safe That's safe for her'Cause they, they just hurt And she don't know why that God sauntered I hope he's trying She said, she said, she said, she said She said, "I hope he's trying Frank, do you think he's trying "Then I said, "I don't know"But I asked her, "What's wrong "She just nods her head And then I asked her, "What's wrong "And she said..."He was the picture perfect person, loved my mother oh so dearly You could feel the love reverberate wherever in our building If it'd feel the same today I wish I'd know, but Sometimes you drive a car and lose control Into poles Hold me closely I don't think you should love me I always feel so lonely Knowing that nothing will ever last forever Sorry, Frank You're much too late, much too late Sorry, Frank You're, you're much too late Much too late"Sorry but- Oh no What up, Bob  God, man We're Hobo Johnson & Lovemakers, we're a couple kids - five I guess - that like to make a little bit of love, like to make a little bit of music  Look at that, it's a desk, just

who turns into the hero at the end and gets the girl"And I was like, "Shut your mouth"But I'm gonna take over...The world As soon as everybody dies I'm gonna take over your heart As soon as I get the balls to try Ima re-arrange the alphabet And then take "U" and "I"And put a bit of space between 'em And hope that nobody cries Ima run around this city, wondering why shit is like this Ima be a nice guy Might fuck around and make a difference Ima hope for the best, but prepare for the worst They're gonna focus on their hooks And then say, "fuck it" to the verse Like, goddamn, but look at me Then look at them Now look at me How's it going My name's Frank Wassuuup Today, we're looking into what really fucking matters Gucci bags, money bands, trap beats, and sarcasmIt's a– It's a– It's a–It's a typical story Where the bassist kills the singer And the guitarist and the drummer Find they're in love with each other It's the story of the kid Who clearly won't know what to say When the love of his life starts to calmly walk away And it's the story of the dad Who decides to chase his dream He quits his job, he falls apart And he loses everything And it's the story of the kid who just wants to make a record Loves and crafts it but nobody ever, ever cares about it Well, hey, hey, what's your name Talk is for the guys you hate We should sit in silence While we think of what to say, hey Hey, hey, I don't think this is working out Will you forget I even asked you to come over to my house Hey, hey I don't think I know much But I know I couldn't take a good punch So if you feel like I've been talking enough Just tell me to shut up and I will gladly shut the fuck upHi, uh, what's up  Uh, my name's Frank, Hobo Johnson  I hope you like this song  I made it up for my dad  It's for you, Dad  Hey!My dad taught me 'bout The story 'bout the birds and the bees When the bees turn into wasps and take half of everything He sounded sure, that a bird doesn't need a full nest But a bed for our bird heads to rest He told me son you'll never dunk Its family tradition basketball is not for us Our legs just aren't that springy My great-great-uncle almost did but he didn't He told me son beware, of the monsters That roam the depths of your head Sometimes they'll make you real sad or Or real, real mad, or real, real jealous and That's real, real bad, boy breathe Nicotine until you fall asleep like all of our family Breathe!Nicotine until you fall asleep Like, all of our family, like all of our family I'm the new Will Smith, I'm I'm, Will Smith mixed with Michael Cera I'm Will Smith, Michael Cera Kevin Spacey, Michael Cera manYou should go and quit your job And make all of those dreams come true How is your self-esteem  Huh That's important in what you're about to do Don't talk to your friends Their opinion holds so much weight And that doesn't make sense Even your family Parents just don't understand Except for Will Smith, he's got a great understanding Make the time Drop school, and people, and work to play Music all night You'll make a dollar an hour, at least you'll like your life And roll with the punches even when it feels like You're getting fucking jumped but you're a real bad judge of it Hold on tight, boy, might be a fuckin' hell of a ride But, but, but, they said it's a three-percent chance That I'm gonna make it That's a little bit less than what it is in my mind But it's okay, I think I can take it They said it's a three-percent My friends, that's what they said And then I sat there and thought about it And almost believed it for a secThe butterflies in my stomach have died Now there's lowly caterpillars that are waiting for the night to strike And they've been dying to escape The pit of my stomach's a real dark fuckin' place My new friends are starting to know Why my old ones don't talk to me anymore My ex knows why my last one's my last one Hey, guess why It's 'cause my fuckin' actions I'm gonna feel alone forever I'm gonna feel alone forever But I'm getting used to the thought Except late at night, so maybe I'm not I'm gonna feel alone forever I'm gonna feel alone forever But I'm getting used to the thought Except–She went to Columbia and I went to jail I just wanted another apple when she really wanted Yale And that is the problem where all of this lies I'm emotionally unstable—crazy fuckin' guy!Who's–Ayo, dead ass My mom's pretty sure I'm going to be a somewhat successful rapper I do too I'm not a nice guy I go to jail sometimes But I am slowly getting better Ever since a little lady wrote me such a lovely letter I love breathing, pizza, Santa Claus and Jesus and other things that feel real nice to believe in I love drinking, but not enough to ever have to go to all those stupid meetings And I love you, De Marcus Cousins and Ashley I love you, De Marcus Cousins and Ashley I love you, De Marcus Cousins and Ashley I love you, you, you, you, you I love you like the stars love lonely eyes, ah On seven
