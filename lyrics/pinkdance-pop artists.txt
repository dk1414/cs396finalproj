And disciplinary remains mercifully Yes and um, I’m with you Derek, this star nonsense Yes, yes, now which is it I am sure of it So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell  Blue skies from pain Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail A smile from a veil  Do you think you can tell Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts Hot ashes for trees  Hot air for a cool breeze Cold comfort for change  Did you exchange A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage How I wish, how I wish you were here We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl, year after year Running over the same old ground, what have we found The same old fears, wish you were hereTicking away the moments that make up a dull day Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown Waiting for someone or something to show you the way Tired of lying in the sunshine Staying home to watch the rain And you are young and life is long And there is time to kill today And then one day you find Ten years have got behind you No one told you when to run You missed the starting gun And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun But it's sinking Racing around to come up behind you again The sun is the same in a relative way But you're older Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death Every year is getting shorter Never seem to find the time Plans that either come to naught Or half a page of scribbled lines Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way The time is gone, the song is over Thought I'd something more to sayHello  Is there anybody in there Just nod if you can hear me Is there anyone home Come on , now I hear you're feeling down Well, I can ease your pain And get you on your feet again Relax I'll need some information first Just the basic facts Can you show me where it hurts There is no pain, you are receding A distant ship, smoke on the horizon You are only coming through in waves Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying When I was a child, I had a fever My hands felt just like two balloons Now I've got that feeling once again I can't explain, you would not understand This is not how I amShut the
