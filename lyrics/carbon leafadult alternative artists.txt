merry when I marry Mary Mac Kaiyut-little-ottle-eetle-ottle-eetle-umHoliday quiet on these streets, except for some stubborn leaves That didn't fall with the fall, and now they clatter in vain Holiday sky, midnight clear Wind is high, hard to steer Old muffler rumbles like an old fighter plane In search of some rest, in search of a break From a life of tests where something's always at stake Where something's always so far What about my broken car What about my life so far What about my dream What about What about everything What about aeroplanes And what about ships that drank the sea What about What about the moon and stars What about soldier battle scars And all the anger that they eat I am not in need Get away and come with me Come away with me and we'll see If I was right on that night, that a future was made Before time takes each year, like a knife cuts it clear It's school, then work and then life that just sharpens the blade I think about time for fun I think about time for play Then I think about being done, with no resume With no one left to blame What about fortune and fame What about your love to obtain What about the ring What aboutLive a life less ordinary Live a life extraordinary with me Live a life less sedentary Live a life evolutionary with me Well I hate to be a bother But it's you and there's no other, I do believe You can call me naive but...I know me very well And I know what I need The night you came into my life Well it took the bones of me, took the bones of me You blew away my storm and strife And shook the bones of me, shook the bones of me By the way, I do know why you stayed away...I will keep tongue-tied next time Live a life less ordinary Live a life extraordinary with me My face had said too much Before our hands could even touch To greet a 'hello'A little later on that year I told you that I loved you dear What do you know This you weren't prepared to hear I'm a saddened man, I'm a broken boy I'm a toddler with a complex toy I've fallen apart, since the ambush of your heartCouldn't ask for a better day, two by two To the ring to the right point of view Each retreat to the corner that's defined by you To the ring to the right point of...Lonely Reign She is the Boxer, she knows When and where to strike He is the Boxer, he knows No peaceful sleep tonight Caught the downfall of Pete and May, Ryan too Doctor Mike was 'fight or flight' at Dundrum School To the ring to the right point of...No return  No passion left to burn The Boxers grow weary Their eyesight...blurry view Lonely Reign She is the Boxer, she knows When and where to strike He is the Boxer, he knows No peaceful sleep tonightLove endures, it clings away When asked to leave, it begs to stay Like the perfect song at imperfect times It's the way the chord's struck with the rhyme So let your troubles roll by He knows he can help himself He can tell by a look at the books on his shelf Then someone somewhere loses a son Before her own sunset is said and done And she dreams of sunflowers bent-over Frozen in snow and thinks Colorado Then lives her life back in slow motion To keep in touch with that raw emotion In the night, crushed empty can Olive Oyl's waiting for her man To come in from the fight That will change their life For good this time When all of your tears dry Let your troubles roll by When all of your tears dry Let your troubles roll by When all of your tears dry Let your troubles roll by Let your troubles roll byNot been here since I was a boy The sky unwrapped, the world my toy A movie reel a million miles long On and onâ€¦Scene after scene passes by my life The window's a wound  The road is a knife The irony, ask me, 'where have you been 'I don't know, I don't know Because I don't know where to begin Too much to do, too much to see Pictures to take, people to meet When there's so much space in between It overwhelms me Scene after scene passes by my life The window's a wound  The road is a knife The irony, ask me, 'where have you been 'I don't know, I don't know Because I don't know where to begin Not been here since I was a boy Now heart full of fear and a mask of painted joy So much for these youthful eyes to see So much for peace and tranquilityGrey sky Always in your eyes Where is the girl behind the cloud Grey sky Always floating by But I only peek when I'm allowed You welcome me in And your veil is so thin But the mystery continues to grow You say, "You must realize That my grey sky eyes Neither rain nor they glow Now ya' know"They neither rain nor they glow Now ya' know So I I'll try to not act so surprised I'll feel my way, I'll underplay All my curosity And hide all the questions in my skin Grey sky I think I changed my mind I find no need to pretend Grey sky Would you allow me to be So into you, my friend Blinding bright, we see Through renaissance dreaming We believe the daily muse Buried but listening And all we need is gathering Fighting night, we leave All our befallen gifts surround us We retreat to the darkened lodge That's cold with no songs to sing And all we need is gathering So chase the bear Or run away Put on your mittens to curse the flame Spirits from The gallows sang"Stand in the fire but pray for rain"Hollow out yourself Just to take it in again And find the distant sound An empty vessel But it's always haunted, thrashing out Soon we find All we need is gatheringMorning hits me up early I follow my thoughts down the road I take what I find I keep my pockets lined Looking for gifts from the crows They follow me all through the branches They call out the signs of warning They gather and off they go They follow me all through the branches They call out the signs of warning They gather and off they go But I don't want to be All alone, all alone All alone, all alone All alone, all alone All alone, all alone Shining on the way home I found a gift from the crows There's a candle set on the table There's a orange burning low in the sky There's a fragile peace washing over me But it never outpaces the nightChase the high ground Where you'd rather be Where you might be found Face all aglow, to leave from here To pack up and go But it takes some time to get away You will have to build from what remains To run it takes the courage of a lamb To love, the fierceness of a storm Paloma, you wonder if you'll miss the thunder And everyone's staring, but no one is caring for you now Just spread your wings, latch on to the breeze Just take the leap, and you're free Chase the higher ground Where you'd rather be Where you might be found This move may erase the troubles in your head Or expose the absence of your soul
