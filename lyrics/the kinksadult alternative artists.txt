came over and mugged me And knocked my reindeer to the floor They said Father Christmas, give us some money Don't mess around with those silly toys We'll beat you up if you don't hand it over We want your bread so don't make us annoyed Give all the toys to the little rich boys Don't give my brother a Steve Austin outfit Don't give my sister a cuddly toy We don't want no jigsaw or Monopoly money We
