To make a mountain of your life Is just a choice But I never learned enough To listen to the voice that told me Always love, Hate will get you every time Always love, Don't wait til the finish line Slow demands come 'round Squeeze the air and keep the rest out It helps to write it down Even when you then cross it out But Always Love, Hate will get you every time Always Love, Even when you wanna fight Self-directed lives I want to know what it'd be like to Aim so high above Any card that you've been dealt, you Always Love, Hate will get you every time Always Love, Hate will get you-Three important rules for breaking up Don't put off breaking up when you know you want to Prolonging the situation only makes it worse Tell him honestly, simply, kindly, but firmly Don't make a big production Don't make up an elaborate story This will help you avoid a big tear jerking scene If you want to date other people say so Be prepared for the boy to feel hurt and rejected Even if you've gone together for only a short time And haven't been too serious There's still a feeling of rejection When someone says she prefers the company of others To your exclusive company But if you're honest, and direct And avoid making a flowery emotional speech When you break the news The boy will respect you for your frankness And honestly he'll appreciate the kind and Straightforward manner in which you told him your decision Unless he's a real jerk or a cry baby you'll remain friends I'm head of the class I'm popular I'm a quarterback I'm popular My mom says I'm a catch I'm popular I'm never last picked I got a cheerleading chickOh, fuck it I'm gonna have a party Oh, fuck it I'm gonna have a party I had the blankest year I saw life turn into a T.V  show It was totally weird The person I knew I didn't really know Time don't move We're the only ones who do Bending reason Cause its all we hold on to I had the blankest year I saw life turn into a T.V  show It was totally weird The person I knew I didn't really know And I was lonely Thank god the band's doing well But you don't own me I'd like to return this spell Cause it's not my size And your lies are so much bigger than my lies And your ties are made of things that shouldn't make tiesSit on a train, reading a book Same damn planet, every time I look Try to relax and slow my heartbeat Only works when I'm dead asleep Been thinking and drinking, all over the town Must be gearing up for some kind of meltdown All I am is a body floating downwind All I am is a body floating downwind"What's wrong ""Nothing.""Are you sure nothing's wrong ""Yeah.""But you're sad about something ""Yeah.""So tell me what ""I don't know."I can't tell you I can't tell you I can't tell you I can't tell youThe world's locked up in your head You've been pouring in a concrete bed Your habits ossified You don't realize you're fried, so fried To find someone you love You gotta be someone you love To find someone you love You gotta be someone you love The reason's somewhere in the din But it takes years till it sinks in You've used up the easy streets And you lost your taste for treats You're so fried To find someone you love You gotta be someone you love To find someone you love You gotta be someone you love Stay high if you have to Do whatever it asks you You got another calling Don't let it pass you You know it 'cause you wrote it You just didn't think you'd actually do it It's just another wish you wished in a very long list AhEveryone's right and no one is sorry That's the start and the end of the story From the Sharks and the Jets to the call in the morning Everyone's right and no one is sorry That's the start and the end of the story From the Sharks and the Jets to the call in the morning And life is just bets anyway Look alive, see these bones What you are now, we were once Try as they might, no one's immune to Misfiring and acting on the wrong clues And thinking this time to re-do and re-do I feel rain in the movies and the talk before the screen lights I hear strings in the park I don't like to call or write, except when it's too late at night I mostly just think in the dark Look alive, see these bones What you are now, we were once But just like we are, you'll be dust And just like we are, permanentWatching terrible T V, it kills all thought Getting spacier than an astronaut Making out with people I hardly know or like I can't believe what I do late at night I wanna know what it's like On the inside of love I'm standing at the gates I see the beauty above Only when we get to see the aerial view Will the patterns show, we'll know what to do I know the last page so well, I can't read the first So I just don't start, it's getting worse I wanna know what it's like On the inside of love I'm standing at the gates I see the beauty above I wanna know what it's like On the inside of love I can't find my way in I try again and againI'm just a happy kid Stuck with the heart of a sad punk Drowning in my id Always searching like it's on junk No matter who I hang out with I can hear the clack-clunk Of the chains that pull the cars up The roller coaster mountaintop so high When it comes down, it shoots back up Straight back to the sky I gotta laugh and then I'm asleep And then I walk around and wanna cry Out at night to do the strand The little candles make the bottles glow Got ink all over my right hand Getting crushes with no chance to grow It's like I'll never ever land There's always too much sun or too much snow I get slow days and no days I get rusty and it's hard But I get notions and oceans are coming to my callCats and dogs are coming down14th street is gonna drown Everyone else rushing around I've got Blonde on Blonde On my portable stereo It's a lullaby From a giant golden radio I've got no time I want to lose To people with something to prove What can you do but let them talk And make your way down the block I've got Blonde on Blonde On my portable stereo It's a lullaby From a giant golden radio I've got Blonde on Blonde On my portable stereo It's a lullaby From a giant golden radio I've got Blonde on Blonde On my portable stereo It's a lullaby From a giant golden radioLeave me alone and there'll be no one to get hurt Nobody move and there'll be nothin' to disturb The sum of it all is that you don't know where to turn Despite all your promises, you don't keep what you learn Beautiful beat, get me out of this mess Beautiful beat, lift me up from distress Sometimes, all I want is another drink or another pill If I could get anything done, maybe I'd hold still I'm trying to levitate, I'm trying to leave the ground Tryin' to remember when I could fix anything with sound Beautiful beat, get me out of this mess Beautiful beat, lift me up from distress I believe our love can save me Have to believe that it can I want to redirect myself with you Do you understand
