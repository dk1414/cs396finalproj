The world was on fire and no one could save me but you It's strange what desire will make foolish people do I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you No, I don't wanna fall in love No, I don't wanna fall in love With you What a wicked game we play, to make me feel this way What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you And I wanna fall in love No, I wanna fall in love With youBaby did a bad bad thing Baby did a bad bad thing Baby did a bad bad thing Baby did a bad bad thing You ever love someone so much You thought your little heart was gonna break in two I didn't think so You ever tried with all your heart and soul To get your lover back to you I wanna hope so You ever pray with all your heart and soul Just to watch her walk away  Yeah Baby did a bad bad thing Baby did a bad bad thing Baby did a bad bad thing Feel like crying Feel like crying You ever toss and turn, you're lying awake And thinking about the one you love I don't think so You ever close your eyes you're making believe You're holding the one you're dreaming of Well, if you say so It hurts so bad when you finally know Just how low, low, low, low, low she'll goBlue hotel On a lonely highway Blue hotel Life don't work out my way Blue hotel On a lonely highway Blue hotel Life don't work out my way I wait alone each lonely night Blue hotel Blue hotel Blue hotel Every room is lonely Blue hotel I was waiting only The night and the life of her lonely dreamThere is a woman far over the sea Standing and waiting praying for me Here I lie sleeping a girl by my side Who am I hurting each time I lie Lie to me Lie Lie to me Lie There is a woman trying hard to be brave The way that I hurt her has made her afraid Things that I'm doing are breaking her heart Still she's pretending we'll never part Lie to me Lie Lie to me Lie I don't care what people may say I know everybody lies I'm not trying to hurt my love I'm only trying to get byI still love you I still want you I still need you Don't hang up and say goodbye Walking on the beach last night and hoping things would be alright But later lying on her bed it's you I saw instead Thinking of the one I love You know what I'm thinking of San Francisco days, San Francisco nights I met a girl in Mexico and should have told her then I know That I still think of you we never will be through San Francisco days, San Francisco nights San Francisco days, San Francisco nights I still love you I still want you I still need you Don't hang up and say goodbye Walking down on Market Street and feeling my heart skip a beat To see someone that looks like you I guess that I'm not through Dreaming of the one I love you know what I'm dreaming of San Francisco days, San Francisco nightsBroken skies, heartaches that flowers won't mend Say goodbye knowing that this is the end Tender dreams, shadows fall Love too sweet, to recall Dry your eyes, face the dawn Life will go on Life will go on All day long thought that we still had a chance Letting go, this is the end of romance Broken hearts find your way Make it through just this day Face the world on your own Life will go on Life will go onWhen I was younger I believed that dreams came true Now I wonder'Cause I've seen much more of dark skies than of blue Now I wonder I keep on praying for a blue sky I keep on searching through the rain I keep on thinking of the good times Will they ever come again Now I wonder Now I wonder I keep on praying for a blue sky I keep on searching through the rain I keep on thinking of the good times Will they ever come again Now I wonder Oh, I wonderNobody ever warns you Or tells you what to do She walks away You're left to stay Alone Forever blue The stars have all stopped shining The sun just won't break through Each day's the same More clouds, more rain You're left forever blue Forever blue 'cause you love her But she doesn't love you You did your best Life did the rest You're left forever blue No reason left for living Still, theres a lot to do New tears to cry Old songs to sing And feel forever blue And be forever...BlueIt's a big blue spanish sky Lay on my back and watch clouds roll by I've got the time to wonder why She left me It's a slow sad spanish song I knew the words but I sang them wrong The one I love has left and gone Without me Now she's gone, our world has changed Watching a blue sky, thinking of rain It's a slow sad spanish song I knew the words but I sang them wrong The one that I love has left and gone Without me It's a big blue spanish sky I lay on my back and watch clouds roll by I only wish I could make you cry Like I do Like I do Like I doTrouble going round, trouble going down What happened to you little baby What happened to you little girl She said she'd always love you, in you heart shaped world Trouble going round, trouble in this town What happened to you little baby What happened to you little girl She left you out there crying, in your heart shaped world I know what love means too you, I love you to It hurts to watch her laugh at you, with someone new Trouble, trouble Trouble going round, round, round, round, round Big cold sunless skies tumbling down, down, down, down What happened to you little baby What happened to you little girl She said she'd always love you, in you heart shaped world
