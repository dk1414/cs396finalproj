you want from me, just set me freeHow many times will man be burned Before he realizes the lessons he must learn How many dreams will blow out in time Before they have their chance to shine And I say whoa, whoa, come sing with me And I say whoa, whoa, I...I try to dream in color But the world sees in Black and White I try to see what's peaceful But the world seems to want to fight How many children is there no future for They're trapped behind the walls of war How many songs must be written to say That 'peace and love' is the only way And I say whoa, whoa, come sing with me And I say whoa, whoa, I...I try to dream in color But the world sees in Black and White I try to see what's peaceful But the world seems to want to fightIt's the love of the world, that makes me smile The love of the world, that makes me cry'Cause there's not enough of that little red stuff to go around It's getting me down Oh, some people say, maybe some day We will be able to say There's no fear of war, no hate no more For this day I always pray I'm a believer that love will show us the way Come on feel the passion What happens I'll show you today It's the love of the world, that makes me smile The love of the world, that makes me cry'Cause there's not enough of that little red stuff to go around It's getting me down Oh, some people say there's just no way For everyone to feel the same Oh, I say they're wrong, stand up be strong Show them that life is no game Come take the chance and we'll dance forever today Come catch the feeling, revealing love's here to stayPeople always sayin' what you can and cannot do Well listen to me people I just do what I want to I cannot justify a man with the power To decide if and when I come down off my tower I know with the power from above I can make it work for me when it comes to push and shove I know from the talk upon the street I can make a difference in who I meet I can do anything I want I say you can't Stop me from jammin' on I can do anything I want I say you can't Stop me from jammin' on Let it be anything anything anything I want All my life I've always followed my dreams People think you're crazy for your self esteem I ain't gonna sit down on my attitude and pout I'm gonna be heard even if I have to shout because I can do anything I want I say you can't Stop me from jammin' on I can do anything I want I say you can't Stop me from jammin' on Let it be anything anything anything I wantSometimes love can make you blind Selfishness makes things seem out of line Don't move too quick or you'll slip and trip Love will desert you, better get a good trip But oh, the fella's told me so;"Better listen to my mind, don't worry 'bout being kind"But oh, should've listen to my soul I knew that girl was worth her, weight in gold Now I realize, what a good thing I had Now I realize, I got myself feelin' bad Now I realize, you should not ever let go I realize, until your heart tells you so Sex will tempt you with all of his lies Lust will rape you of your pride Tell me, tell me baby, how can I be so weak I should have known better, love don't come cheap But oh, the fella's told me so;"Better listen to my mind, don't worry 'bout being kind"But oh, should've listen to my soul I knew that girl was worth her, weight in gold Now I realize, what a good thing I had Now I realize, I got myself feelin' bad Now I realize, you should not ever let go I realize, until your heart tells you soFlamingo's walk and sway in peace Seeing this it makes my troubles cease The sun is hiding leaving a pink scar That stretches right across the sky That's all we've seen so far And all I do is look into your eyes For that special touch of paradise Just a touch a touch of paradise Just a special touch of paradise A touch of Spring and Autumn sweet Well the trees vibrate, when our eyes meet And I think of all the love that we have been making You touch my hand and I walk off shaking Just a touch of paradise Just a special touch of paradise Just a touch a touch of paradise You hold my hand, that's when we kiss And it doesn't take long no, until I get the gist Of this love that stretches out across the land Where rainbows flash, as we're walking in the sand And all I do is look into your eyes
