Your arms are warm but they make me feel As if they're made of cold, cold steel A simple kiss like a turnin' key A little click and the lock's on me Can't move my arms Can't lift my hands I won't admit to where I am But I know baby I'm in chains I'm in chains I pretend I can always leave Free to go whenever I please But then the sound of my desperate calls Echo off these dungeon walls I've crossed the line from mad to sane A thousand times and back again I love you baby I'm in chains I'm in chains I'm in chains I'm in chainsDo you wanna be a poet and write Do you wanna be an actor up in light Do you wanna be soldier and fight for love Do you wanna travel the world Do you wanna be a diver for pearls Or climb a mountain, touch the clouds above Be anyone you want to be Bring to life your fantasies But I want something in return I want you to burn Burn for me, baby Like a candle in my life Oh, burn, burn for me, baby Burn for me Are you gonna be a gambler and deal Are you gonna be doctor and heal Or go to heaven and touch God's face Are you gonna be a dreamer who sleeps Are you gonna be a sinner who weeps Or an angel under grace Moon so bright, night so fine Keep your heart here with mine Life's a dream we are dreaming Race the moon, catch the wind Ride the night to the end Seize the day, stand up for the light I want to spend my lifetime loving you If that is all in life I ever do Heroes rise, heroes fall Rise again, win it all In your heart, can't you feel the glory Through our joy, through our pain We can move worlds again Take my hand, dance with me I want to spend my lifetime loving you If that is all in life I ever do I will want nothing else to see me through If I can spend my lifetime loving you Though we know we will never come again Where there is love, life begins Over and over againJ'n'ai connu qu'une histoire d'amour Au fil de ma vie Cet homme m'a promis le toujours Et puis s'est enfui C'est la couleur de l'enfer Quand les mensonges salissent tout J'aurais pu sombrer sous la colère Comme un cheval fou Mais ce qui m'a sauvée C'est de pouvoir aimer Aimer jusqu'à l'impossible Aimer, se dire que c'est possible D'aimer d'un amour invincible Aimer jusqu'à l'impossible C'est possible J'ai vu mes châteaux en Espagne, ce que j'ai bâti Disparaître sous les flammes de la jalousie C'est une douleur sans égal Quand sa vie part en étincelles J'aurais pu vendre mon âme au diable Comme un criminelYour arms are warm but they make me feel As if they're made of cold, cold steel A simple kiss like a turnin' key A little click and the lock's on me Can't move my arms Can't lift my hands I won't admit to where I am But I know baby I'm in chains I'm in chains I pretend I can always leave Free to go whenever I please But then the sound of my desperate call Echo off these dungeon walls I've crossed the line from mad to sane A thousand times and back again I love you babyJ'ai vécu heureuse dans mes palais d'or noir et de pierres précieuses Le Tigre glissait sur les pavés de cristal Mille califes se bousculaient sur mes carnets de bal On m'appelait la cité pleine de grâce Dieu comme le temps passe On m'appelait capitale de lumière Dieu que tout se perd Je m'appelle Bagdad, et je suis tombée Sous le feu des blindés, sous le feu des blindés Je m'appelle Bagdad, princesse défigurée Shéhérazade m'a oubliée, m'a oubliée...Je vis sur mes terres comme une pauvre mendiante, sous les bulldozers Les esprits me hantent, je pleure ma beauté en ruine Sous les pierres encore fumantes, c'est mon âme qu'on assassine On m'appelait capitale de lumière Dieu que tout se perdYou see the same sun in the sky We see the same stars every night I wanna be there in the dark when your world falls apart I wanna break through every wall Just to show you I am yours And take a chance on you again You are my everything For you, I dream of who I could be I'd write a thousand symphonies I'd lose it all to get you back You are everything I wanna love you but my head says no I wanna kiss you but I don't come close I wanna tell you that I love you so I'm doing it all for your love But I know that it's never enough Oh no it's never enough, never enough Living in between the lights Missing you before we say goodbye It's you I love the most But are we chasing ghosts When I go to sleep at night, I wanna feel you by my side For you, I'd bleed, I'd die to see you and I open my eyesI can't be with you again Don't remind me of the good times that we had I learned a lot from us since then And I never want these feelings to ever come again You'll never hear me crying You'll never see me trying To love you once again Your love is so past tense Please don't tell me that you've changed Don't want to hear on how, you've lost your evil ways The one who's changed this time is me And I won't go back to feeling helpless and deceived You never hear me crying You never see my trying To love you once again Your love is so past tense You never hear me crying You never see my trying To love you once again Your love is so past tenseYeah, la la la, la la la I was lost in a world looking inside And no one could hear me I close my eyes, and I'm somewhere else When no one can see me lying, I'm crying I need some peace But I haven't found it Something's gotta change Nothing stays the same Something's gotta change'Cause I can't live this way yeah I've had love, like a drug running though me But nothing that's lasting Turn my cheek, when a man gets weak Too guilty to speak, when nobody asks me That's passed me I am sad, but I'm still laughing Something's gotta change'Cause nothing stays the same Something's gotta change yeah'Cause I can't live this way Something's gotta change Nothing stays the same Something's gotta change'Cause I can't live this wayIs there something on your skin Or something in my tree That's getting me so high Is this something in your stare Or something in the air That's making this so right You stay with me Don't let it slip Away from me'Cause when the sun goes down And the stars come out We can raise our glass'Cause we made it And when there's you and I If we hold on tight We can play this out like a classic So please don't kill the magic No, please don't kill the magic'Cause all we have is magic Like heaven on your lips Your smoke that I breathe in It's taken me over Like whisky and water Like mother and daughter We couldn't be closer
