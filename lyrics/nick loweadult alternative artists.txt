understand, dear But you still mystify and I want to know why I pick myself up off the ground To have you knock me back down again and again And when I ask you to explain you say You gotta be Cruel to be kind in the right measure Cruel to be kind it's a very good sign Cruel to be kind means that I love you Baby, you gotta be cruel to be kindAs I walk this wicked world Searching for light in the darkness of insanity I ask myself is all hope gone Is there only pain, hatred and misery  And each time I feel like this inside There's one thing I wanna know What's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding Ooh, what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding And as I walk on through troubled times My spirit gets so downhearted sometime, sometimes Where are the strong and who are the trusting And where is the harmony, sweet harmony now 'Cause each time I feel it slippin' away it just makes me wanna cry What's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding Ooh, what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding Ooh, where are the strong and who are the trusting And where is the harmony, sweet harmony now The beast in me Is caged by frail and fragile bars Restless by day and by night Rants and rages at the stars God help the beast in me The beast in me Has had to learn to live with pain And how to shelter from the rain And in the twinkling of an eye Might have to be restrained God help the beast in me Sometimes it tries to kid me That it's just a teddy bear Or even somehow manage To vanish in the air Then that is when I must beware Of the beast in me That everybody knows They've seen him out dressed in my clothes Patently unclear If it's New York or New Year God help the beast in me The beast in meYou'd better run, you'd better hide You'd better lock

upon your feet Else the S.P.G.'s gonna be clearin' the streets They never made no provision in the original plan for Half a boy and half a manTaking nothing but his daddy's old bone-grip knife He traded but a little for the wayward life A faint heart never won fair hand So says the Rose of England From high on a hill came the clarion call To gain young men, come one, come all Make muster 'gainst the foreign hand That's raised to the Rose of England For her feckless boys she did weep and wail Saying, Lord have mercy where did I fail Out of my belly, the pick up a gun And fall for the Rose of England God knows it's a cold outside It's a fire by day and a freeze at night I know it's a hell out there How loud the mouth when the heart don't care He's damned if he don't, and damned if he do He'd die if he ever found out we knew Hot potato, drop it and run Far from the Rose of EnglandOh, I can't take another heartache Though you say you're my friend I'm at my wits' end You say your
