Wait for me in times of trouble Stay up late, keep it low Grounded deep in your love Falling in and falling out on lower bands Loose the hours sink in together Keep in close, run it down Grounded deep in your love Falling in onto the quiet lower bands Under solid black skies, wide awake I Don’t want to go home We sink under, kiss in the tunnels Listen to distant channels We sink down and rise up Under solid black skies, wide awake I Don’t want to go home Under solid black skies, wide awake I Don’t want to go home Don’t want to go home I’m light on my feet And grounded deep in your loveLovesick once again I get slapstick when you walk in I get so nervous, I stutter and flail Troubled sleep I don't eat I've gone pale Tarantulas under the skin Got King Kong battling within A blood moon looms in the sky above I'm the wolfman I'm frantic in love Chorus It it it it it it it rips into me I I I I I I I'm a mess Violins in my heart And I start To shake and I shake and I shake Romance, flowers, champagne We go dancing, we kiss in the rain I'm sedated and trying to forget I'm agitated I'm covered in sweatOutside In the middle of the night I build it for you I build it for you Outside In the middle of the night Things fall apart We can start again I’ll build it for you I’ll build it for you I’ll build it for you I’ll build it for you We can start again I move below My city grows and unwinds I cut the tunnels I ride the trains Into the night Everyone knows, no one says Start again, start again Everyone knows, no one says Start again, start againI listen to empty stations And the sound of you there An echo left on the dial Paused in between Midnight broadcasts Your voice like white noise You say, “We are passing away,”I know it’s only goodbye You say, “We are passing away,”But I, I won’t miss you I won’t miss you I listen to empty stations And the sound of you there An echo left in the tunnel On a train that never comes Midnight broadcasts Your touch like red rust After we all come out Into the morning After the lights go on And we look less pretty Our songs are still Only a ringing left I will stay out And dance with you To the beat, the beat of daylight The beat of daylight The beat of daylight Come on, boy Let in the light I want to take you Out in the morning Come on, boy Come outside I want to show you Show you the morningFalling in love Falling in love Tonight Heaven breathes for me Sighs in my ear Because you’re near I keep Calm when you’re here I don’t sleep, dear When you’re gone When you’re gone And we’re Falling in love Falling in love Red night Pleated 45 daydreams Aging half-blind Splits the still nightTrying to find a way To find my way back to you Waiting for sunrise A better light, to see it through To remind us This is love, this is love This is love, this is love This is love, this is love This is love, this is love This is love This is love I say “Goodnight.”You say, “Stay the night.”I say, “Alright."Tell me not to go I say “Goodnight.”You say, “Stay the night.”Oh, stay the night, stay the night Time to call it out Not all together, pulled together In shadows, I follow you Not all together, pulled togetherFade away Blotto daylight Latency Holding on Got potential Wait and see Irritation Expectation Bridge to break Still time to make it Rile me up And you make me wait Bridge to break Still time to make Got time to make it Cold love You loosen my alignments Oh I Lie when I say I won't go down Can't get enough Of your commotion Oh I Measure my length along the ground The ground The ground The groundComes as no surprise But still I lose a little each time Your head trails back You lean into it until you fade Away Blue eyes gone white You lose a bit each time and so do I We fade away You know it’s breaking my heart You’re always breaking my heart Without patience Without a reason why But I black out the sun Sleep until the evening comes It all fades Away You know it’s breaking my heart You’re always breaking my heartI’ve been walking in circles, they Lead nowhere just like talking to you I see you around every corner But I don’t recognise I don’t recognise you Waiting for you to come around Got caught up in tired lines you Left here and they split along seams Seems You don’t realise I don’t recognise I don’t recognise you I don’t recognise I don’t recognise you
