I can't imagine all the people that you know And the places that you go When the lights are turned down low And I don't understand All the things you've seen But I'm slipping in between You and your big..  dreams It's always you and my big dreams And you tell me That it's over But I can't stand here in a patch of four leaf clover And you're restless And I'm naked You've got to get out You can't stand to see me shaking No, could you let me go I didn't think so And you don't want to be here in the future So you say The present's just a pleasant Interruption to the past And you don't want to look much closer Cause you're afraid to find out all the hope That you had sent into the sky by now had..  crashed And it did because of meI woke up in New York City From my sleep behind the wheel Caught a train to Poughkeepsie And time stood still She wrote me a letter from San Diego To qualify her luck These flights connect through Arizona But I think I'll stay stuck So here I am Here I am, whoa Well I woke up in a car I traced away the fog so I could see The Mississippi on her knees I've never been so lost I've never felt so much at home Please write my folks and throw away my keys I woke up in a car I woke up in a carIt's a good year for a murder She's praying to Jesus, she's pulling the trigger There's no tears 'cause he's not here She washes her hands, and she fixes the dinner But soon, they'll be coming to rush her away No one's so sure if her crime had a reason And reasons like seasons, they constantly change And the seasons of last year, like reasons, have floated away Away with this spilt milk Away with this dirty dish water, away Seventeen years, and all that he gave was a daughter"It's me and the moon," she says And I got no trouble with that And I am a butterfly, but you won't let me die"It's me and the moon," she says And it's over, but it just started The blood stained the carpet, her heart like a crystal She's lucid and departed A life left behind, she can find in her mind gone away Away with these nightmares, away with suburbia Shake down away You marry a role, and you give up your soul 'til you break downShake down, you make me break For goodness sake, I think I'm on the edge Of something new with you Shout out, don't drown the sound I'll drown you out, you'll never scream so loud As I want to scream with you Standing there with your smile blinding Your eyes from seeing my face as I'm dying To figure out a girl But she drifts so far away I'm on her coast so maybe I should stay And map around your world So don't say These currents are still killing me And you can't explain But the wind went and pulled me Into your hurricane Into your hurricane Stand up, don't make a sound Your ears might bleed, there's sweet fluorescent enemies That live inside of me The world moves faster than I knew Not fast enough to not creep up on you And the space we put betweenI have a story, a bitter anthem For everyone to hear About this kid who just don't like me And that's a solid fact They say he's hunting me, and as you see I'm all swelled up with fear'Cause I can't get him off my back If you see Jordan He makes me sick High school's over And you still won't quit You try to fight me down at Tyler's beach And man I think that's great You nearly cried and said to yell at you Like I do at all the girls And you drove home real quick Did you make it in time to masturbate There's one too many of you in this world If you see Jordan He makes me sick High school's over And you still won't quitMaybe when the room is empty Maybe when the bottle's full Maybe when the door gets broke down Love can break in And maybe when I'm done with thinking Maybe you can think me whole Maybe when I'm done with endings This can begin This can begin This can begin If you could be my punk rock princess I would be your garage band king You could tell me why you just don't fit in And how you're gonna be something Maybe when your hair gets darker Maybe when your eyes get wide Maybe when the walls are smaller There will be more space And maybe when I'm not so tired Maybe you can step inside Maybe when I look for things That I can't replaceI close my eyes, thought I was lost but I was stranded I go outside, to my surprise the sky had landed I thought it made more sense if I could only keep you guessing I was a fool to think that I should stop you from undressing Now I'm believing all the words you say That I can't say back to you To you And so I fall I don't wanna feel this small You know I just can't handle this, handle this at all And I just fall I let my heartbeat drop I falter as the music stops and you watch me as I stall And wonder when I fall I kiss your neck, I feel you breathing on my shoulder Still I'm perfect, it must be you 'cause now it's over I was so close, that was the most that I have ever been through Now old cassettes and cigarettes will be the ones to save youThis is the only lonely picture Waiting on my floor, littering my shore This is the last true burning letter Given to a girl, written by a boy Living in a world created to destroy But if I built you a city, would you let me Would you tear it down But there you go for the last time I finally know now what I should've known then And I could still be ruthless if you let me But there you go when I'm not done You're waving goodbye, well, at least you're having fun The rising tide will not let you forget me Forget me This is your ghost that kneels before me Praises on her tongue, a body full of oxygen It won't be the last time she'll ignore me The thinning of my skin without the strength to go The winter's setting in to cover you in snowI'm lost at sea The radio is jammed, I bet they won't find me I swear it's for the best And then your frequency is pulling me in closer till I'm home And I've been up for days, I finally lost my mind And then I lost my way, I'm blistered but I'm better And I'm home I will crawl There's things that aren't worth giving up I know But I won't let this get me I will fight You live the life you're given with the storms outside Some days all I do is watch the sky This room's too small It's only getting smaller I'm against the wall And slowly getting taller Here in Wonderland This guilt feels so familiar And I'm homeStanding on the edge of morning Scent of sex and New Found Glory Playing as she's pulling back her hair She drives away, she's feeling worthless Used again but nothing's different She'd stay the night but knows he doesn't care Home by three to deafening quiet The porch light's off, guess they forgot it She'd cry herself to sleep but she don't dare And she wants to be a model She wants to hear she's beautiful She's beautiful I want to save you I want to save you I need you to save me too I want to save you Dressed by dawn and out the door No lights, she memorized the floor So she could leave without being detected She works 'til three, it's uniform She dreams that he'll come by the store She prays for days when boys mean she's protected
