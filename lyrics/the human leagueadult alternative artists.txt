You were workin' as a waitress in a cocktail bar When I met you I picked you out, I shook you up and turned you around Turned you into someone new Now five years later on you've got the world at your feet Success has been so easy for you But don't forget, it's me who put you where you are now And I can put you back down too Don't, don't you want me You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me Don't, don't you want me You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me It's much too late to find You think you've changed your mind You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry Don't you want me, baby Don't you want me, ohh Don't you want me, baby Don't you want me, ohh I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar That much is true But even then I knew I'd find a much better place Either with or without you The five years we have had have been such good times I still love you But now I think it's time I live my life on my own I guess it's just what I must doCome on, baby, dry your eyes Wipe your tears Never like to see you cry Won't you please forgive me I wouldn't ever try to hurt you I just needed someone to hold me To fill the void while you were gone To fill this space of emptiness I'm only human Of flesh and blood I'm made Human Born to make mistakes So many nights I longed to hold you So many times I looked and saw your face Nothing could change the way I feel No one else could ever take your place I'm only human Of flesh and blood I'm made Human Born to make mistakes Human Please forgive meAnd put your hand in a parting wave Pass around Make a shroud pulling combs through a backwash frame Find the copies in a carbon mount Pass around Stroke a pocket with a print of a laughing sound Get around town, get around town Where the people look good, where the music is loud Get around town, no need to stand proud Add your voice to the sound of the crowd The shades from a pencil peer Pass around A fold in an eyelid brushed with fear The lines on a compact guide Pass around A hat with alignment worn inside Get in line now, get in line now Stay in time with the rhythm and rhyme Get around town, get around town Where the people look good, where the music is loud Get around town, no need to stand proud Add your voice to the sound of the crowdIf it seems a little time is needed Decisions to be made The good advice of friends unheeded The best of plans mislaid Just looking for a new direction In an old familiar way The forming of a new connection To study or to play And so the conversation turned Until the sun went down And many fantasies were learned On that day Keep feeling fascination Passion burning Love so strong Keep feeling fascination Looking, learning Moving on Well, the truth may need some rearranging Stories to be told And plain to see the facts are changing No meaning left to holdAll day Hiding from the sun Waiting for the golden one Waiting for your fame After the parade has gone Outside was a happy place Every face had a smile like the golden face For a second Your knuckles white as your fingers curl The shot that was heard around the world For a second It took seconds of your time to take his life It took seconds It took seconds of your time to take his life It took seconds It took seconds of your time to take his life Seconds of your time to take his life Seconds Seconds It took seconds of your time to take his life It took seconds It took seconds of your time to take his life It took seconds For a secondWhen you're in love you know you're in love No matter what you try to do You might as well resign yourself To what you're going through If you're a hard man or if you're a child It still might get to you Don't kid yourself You've seen it all before A million mouths have said that too, ooh I've had my hard times  in the past I've been a husband and a lover too I've laid alone and cried at night Over what love made me do And the loved ones who let me down And couldn't share my point of view But this is Phil talking I want to tell you What I found to be true I love your love action Lust's just a distraction No talking just looking Watching your love actionListen to the voice of Buddha Saying stop your sericulture Little people like your offspring Boiled alive for some Gods stocking Buddha's watching, Buddha's waiting Just because the kid's an orphan Is no excuse for thoughtless slaying Children don't forget this torture Just because you call her mother Doesn't mean that she's your better Once more with the voice of Buddha He'll say carry on your slaughter Who cares for the little children You may slice with no conviction Blind revenge on a blameless victim Listen to the voice of Buddha Saying stop your sericulture He'll say carry on your slaughter Who cares for the little children You may slice with no conviction Blind revenge on a blameless victim Listen to the voice of Buddha Listen to the voice of Buddha Listen to the voice of BuddhaShe dreams of 1969 Before the soldiers came The life was cheap on bread and wine And sharing meant no shame She is awakened by the screams Of rockets flying from nearby And scared, she clings onto her dreams To beat the fear that she might die And who will have won When the soldiers have gone From the Lebanon The Lebanon Before he leaves the camp he stops He scans the world outside And where there used to be some shops Is where the snipers sometimes hide He left his home the week before He thought he'd be like the police But now he finds he is at war Weren't we supposed to keep the peace君に胸キュン The summer brings the sun And can the summer tell What I hide so well君に胸キュン My partner is the sun I wonder does she know That I love her so Glimmers on the sea point to the sun Breaking into stars then back to one My eyes are burning, my heart is yearning Yearning for the worship of someone君に胸キュン So hard to tell someone So hard to say you care Here and everywhere君に胸キュン A shadow of the sun A cloud that runs before And along the shoreThe water shines A pebble skips across the face A dozen times Then disappears, not a trace Left behind The thrower turns and walks away A change of mind Another start, a brand new day You know I'll change If change is what you require Your every wish Your every dream, hope, desire Here comes the mirror man Says he's a people fan Here comes the mirror man And if it seems I'm not the one you used to know Our little friendship Left behind not long ago Don't feel too hurt As distance heals the strongest pain Things are much better now And just the nagging doubt remains
