Never had you run so far but you really gotta get away You know it in the nighttime running to it Caught a rising star but then you let it drop into the ocean Now the water's running through it Now you've gone so far you really had to get away You knew it in your lifetime, running to it Acting like you've come so far the bed you made yourself And this house and me are all falling apart Never thought you'd go so far but now you're really gone And it's been so long I never really think about it Yeah you made a beating heart, whatever Now that amber light has faded and it's yours to commit to it Act like it stops and starts, a gesture here and there For me is one thing but I felt it every time you blew it Now you've gone too far Your urge to run away is back and we all knowYes, I'll come back to you No, I won't ask where you run Under the sun Yes, I'll catch up to you Then I'll ask, "what have we done "Under the sun To be free, be awake Big breath that you can’t fake Once you’ve begun Press my face to the back All the pillars that stack And hold up the sun On the right side coming on the right time On the right time coming on the right sideShots ringing out, I'm soaking Eardrums shaking, years start weighin' me down Crawling out from a spiral down Fixing now to mix the white and brown Passing out, running in place You're the sun and I'm your cloud Burning down, running in place Got so high I finally felt like myself Shots wringing out, I'm soaking Eardrums shaking, years start weighing me down Buried deep in a heroine sleep Floating deeper underground Passing out, running in place You're the sun and I was your cloud Burning out, running in place Got so high I finally felt like myself Would you give your 81st year For a glimpse of heaven, now and here Would you give your 60th year For a glimpse of heaven, now and here Would you give your 45th year For a glimpse of heaven, now and here Would you give your 34th year For a glimpse of heaven, now and here I saw you with a very loose grip on your tight ship And I left you with a very big mess then I watched it progress Took a little time for your trip but I saw you starting to slip And you always kept your eyes on any little hiding spot that you had forgot And I saw you after a decent spell in a private hell And I told you, "I hope I live a thousand lives, hope I live them well"Fought my mind to keep my life, but my body’s putting up a tougher fight Yeah if it feels wrong, you can go on along But once it feels right then you just lost the fight I saw you with a very loose grip on your tight ship And I lost you when you said one hit couldn’t hurt a bit Took a little time for your trip but I saw you starting to slip Cause you always kept your eyes on any little hiding spot that you had forgot I can’t shake the terror of my life fleeting, minute by minute Even when I can’t imagine another day waking up in it Fought my mind to keep my life, but my body’s putting up a tougher fight Yeah if it feels wrong, you can go on along But once it feels right then you just lost the fightAnything we should know about your change Bleached black from the smile On a glimpse of your face Yeah I ran to her Blame it on me That inevitable date You remember her I'm putting it off And I can't control fate Cause we're similar I blame it on you Cause that side of me I hate But you were never hurt I'm putting it off And I can't control fate Yeah I ran to her Blame it on me That inevitable game But you were never hurtHow long have you known How long has it shown Forever, forever, forever, if ever How long have you known How long has it shown Forever, if ever, forever, if ever How long How long have you known How long has it shown Forever, if ever, forever, if ever How long have you known How long has it shown Forever, if ever, forever, if ever How long How could i describe This fading dream You turned and looked a way It goes around getting louder now Believe it Freezes love that way Name the song and I’ll Just scream it There’s a Dead moon in my head It claws the ground both lost and found And fleeting To crash into again——How could i describe A long lost dream You turned and looked a way I’ve lived ten lives and had ten loves To remind me What I’ve been guilty of Say the song and I’ll Just scream It there’s a Fucked moon in my head It claws the ground both lost and found And fleeing From the healthy moonThe right side of me Is the right side of me Burn it down and give it up You never wanna give it up Medicine for free If you’d only asked for me I’d be a better animal In every other little way Stuck inside of me In tragedy i’m complete Mother father daughter son My Valentine my only one Keep me in distant sight Of when it's day and when it's night And how many weeks have passed And if I'm still who i was lastArmageddon is a product And  one we choose to buy Dwell  on that for a moment With Paradise on fire I guess it’s all the way Blankenship Children  lead the cry You sold them all away Blankenship With thirty years of lies Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh Who  sold us the dominion Over swine that smell their knife The vicious creature thin and dying On a scrap of melting ice The earth is ownerless Blankenship Children lead the cry You sold them all away Blankenship With thirty years of liesYou watched my lips make The  promise I betrayed The  years I lived in vain Chasing the pain with pain Stand down There's  oil in my name My  tongue flickers like a wilting flame Lay it all out The  path of wreckage that I cut All in want of what Who were you to believe Your lying eyes or me I  won't let them tie to you The shit I put you through Stand down Stand down Stand down Stand down
