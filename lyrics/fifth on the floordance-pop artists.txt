Well I left last night on a midnight train Cold rain like tears on my window pane There's no gain for a man when no one knows his name My head's beggin' me for a cigarette My eye's another line of cain'My heart's another memory On distant memory lane I don't know nobody worth knowin' these days But my boots know every place And it's a race to put some more lines on my face I don't know no heaven I don't know no hell But either way I know I ain't gonna stay'Cause my angels another memory On distant memory lane Ramblin', ramblin' down distant memory lane I know that I will never see you again Lonesome, lonely, that lonesome midnight train Your eyes are another memory on distant memory lane The sun's goin' down on another day The sky's another shade of grey This damn train keeps movin'My heart keeps slippin' away I don't know what's ahead but I know what's behind A thousand miles and your smilin' face But that's just another memory On distant memory laneA cinema of stars We laid out in the yard For hours or showers Touched a heart that is now hers And times we’d share The rest of this year This Christmas I’ll miss us And wish you were here I remember December And frost on the window Where you wrote both of our names Across the window pane‘Fore those flakes touch the ground I’d already be feelin' down I’ll never let go Of those angels in the snow A memory of mine Whisper softly of a time When the world was right A cold starry night And the winter chills felt fine Now my memory began to sing Of all the things that the wintertime brings Smells and sites And little bright lights And promise of a new yearI'm a mother of high lonesome I'm a sister to sin and pain I'm a patron saint of hurtin'And a mistress of goin' insane I've been told I'm a real cold lady I don't feel like I'm even one'Cause I'm a quarter mile past carin'Hell I'm starin' right into the sun And you can find me where the teardrops fall like rain I'm drinkin' this bottle of wine Singin' the same damn refrain I've been known to put my heart out I've been known to watch the rain I've tried my hand at faithful I feel like I'm losin' my faith Every man I've met just kept movin' on I'll be damned if I don't do the same And I pay no mind to those broken hearts Hell I couldn't care less who's to blame And you can find me where the teardrops fall like rain I'm drinkin' this bottle of wine Singin' the same damn refrainWell I left last night on a midnight train Cold rain like tears on my window pane There's no gain for a man when no one knows his name My head's beggin' me for a
