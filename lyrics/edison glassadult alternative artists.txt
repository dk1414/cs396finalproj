I'll make a sound you can remember It's not like it's gonna matter anyway All the things you say are filtered and weighed By your ghost And you'll see what happens next, yeah Oh, to be more than lovely I can save all our memories of us We can be lovers All your breaths are marked with paranoia To satisfy nothing All regret, nonetheless, weight If you feel, then love and forgive me And you'll see what happens next, yeah Oh, to be more than lovely I can save all our memories of us We can be lovers Oh, oh We can be lovers Oh, oh We can be loversIf I'm unable when you are calling If I'm unable If I'm unable when you are calling If I'm unable When all we have is taken All we have is taken now Take my affliction I'm cured with Your comfort Take my affliction Take my depression I'm cured with Your comfort Take my depression When all we have is taken All we have is taken now Will you learn fire burns When all we have is taken I'm, I'm falling to grace again When all we have is takenSinging sweetly, she passed by me She knew, it seemed That sound, that song was troubling me"Do tell""Please, sir"Sleepwalking, sleep, sleepwalking...Last night I awoke to an opera house full of empty seats Performing Einstein on the Beach"You've stifled this too long and the dream inside is far too strong You've got to, got to learn to let go  Let go!"Open your lips, let out a song Open your heart, and let it sing Open your lips, let out a song Open your heart, and let it sing Hey  Let go!Hey  Let go I shut all my windows They protect me from the storm I'm alone but I wait for someone One who keeps the lights on One who keeps the house warm I feel a swaying rhythm If we get swept to sea I'll be happy It's all we wish for now I wish you'd keep the lights down I wish you'd keep the house warm Well, well, we have enough we can handle it If we don't make I will fall apart All is in vain for us, oh We have enough we can handle it If we don't make I will fall apart All is in vain for us, oh I think that we can make it now I think that we can make it If you can keep the lights down If you can keep the house warm, yeahMachines are on the rise They're closing in It's getting dangerous Don't just sit there, I think you run too slow"I could be your ghost"I can run from you, too This control will never get the best of me again I will make it out without a sound This control will never get the best of me again I will make it out without a sound Rain falls upon my back The chill it scares me The chill is scary, oh Black bird as you fall to catch your prey I feel you...I know you're there Turn on the switch And keep your eyes open They won't stop until you're dead This control will never get the best of me again I will make it out without a sound This control will never get the best of me again I will make it out without a soundThis one thing's for certain We all need change We wrap ourselves in blankets To stay warm Well, it's still stinging I can't feel my toes I'm growing numb, I've come undone I can't keep out the cold I don't want to shiver anymore Or be alone...We need warmth to come In our cold condition we need You to visit us Warmth to come...A fire from inside to burn out all our lies Let's sew our hearts together Love will be our thread We dance again with no reason and no inhibition And in this moment we become alive We dance again with no reason and no inhibition Warmth to come...In our cold condition we need You to visit us Warmth to come...A fire from inside to burn out all our livesI'll say to you, "I want so much more right now"So you taught me to listen And I can feel the change Hear the whisper of the summer leaves To the rhythm of your heartbeat I stay up late, look at the pages Where rhythms are made by the scratch of a pen Watchin' you leave, I look at your movement A beauty that sings from the song in your heart I can hear it You told me I can be a part All I have to do is believe And all I need to do is breathe So I can feel you Time is fiction...Time is fiction...Hear the whisper of the summer leaves To the rhythm of your heartbeat I can hear itIn disclosed we speak the truth, discovering dependency Let's turn this ship around, I'm starting over We fight our hearts for the control, wrestling our tendencies Let's turn this ship around, I'm starting over In desperation, a celebration Of time well spent alone with you I'm in such a state I need you here I need you near me I'm in such a state I need you here I need you near me As the sun will rise and set, so I will keep you close As the stars illuminate, so I will hold you near Burn the exits, there's no escaping From love eternal, limitlessWhen we hear it We need to listen close Yeah we'll feel it First a draft and then a wind It'll feel like a burn or a shiver Yeah we'll feel it It's a pull to the earth Like a hand on the top of your head You feel safe here, you can dance here Can you hear it We need to listen close First a draft and then a wind Can you hear it A wave before it breaks Can you feel it A calm before the storm Let's keep this passion flowing Like a child I wait for loveI can feel it all around The questions build uncertainty and doubt Like space between lovers We don't feel the miles we feel the days Oh, I could run away with the moon Oh, and never find the end of you Oh, I could see all things unseen Oh, and never reach the end of you Oh, nothing here makes sense Or could there be some music in the math We're more than just numbers You can't study what your heart's singing The end of beauty...End of glory...End of healing...The end of my distance Oh, I could run away with the moon Oh, And never find the end of you Oh, I could see all things unseen Oh, And never reach..
