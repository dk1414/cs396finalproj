well Everyone makes mistakes You let me down for the last time Truth prevails And there's nothing you can hide And I wash my hands of you Getting on with my life I'm getting on with my life I'm getting on with my life Wanna call and catch up But no matter what I know you still suck Took the drugs from my friends What ever were you thinkin'?Stayed in touch, stood behind While I gave you space And you invade mine well Everyone makes mistakesWith so much drama in the L-B-C It's kinda hard bein Snoop D-O-double-G But I, somehow, some way Keep comin up with funky ass shit like every single day
