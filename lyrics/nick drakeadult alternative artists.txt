I saw it written and I saw it say Pink moon is on its way And none of you stand so tall Pink moon gonna get ye all And it's a pink moon Yeah, it's a pink moon Pink, pink, pink, pink Pink moon A pink, pink, pink, pink Pink moon I saw it written and I saw it say Pink moon is on its way And none of you stand so tall Pink moon gonna get ye all And it's a pink moon Yeah, a pink moonWhen I was young, younger than before I never saw the truth hanging from the door And now I'm older, see it face to face And now I'm older, gotta get up, clean the place And I was green, greener than the hill Where flowers grew and the sun shone still Now I'm darker than the deepest sea Just hand me down, give me a place to be And I was strong, strong in the sun I thought I'd see when day was done Now I'm weaker than the palest blue Oh so weak in this need for youPlease beware of them that stare They'll only smile to see you while your time away And once you've seen what they have been To win the earth just won't seem worth your night or your day Who'll hear what I say Look around, you'll find the ground Is not so far from where you are, but don't be too wise For down below they never grow They're always tired and charms are hired from out of their eyes Never a surprise Take your time and you'll be fine And say a prayer for people there Who live on the floor And if you see what's meant to be Don't name the day or try to say It happened before Don't be shy, you learn to fly And see the sun when day is done, if only you see Just what you are beneath a star That came to say one rainy day in autumn for free Yes, be what you'll beBetty came by on her way Said she had a word to say'Bout things today And fallen leaves Said she hadn't heard the news Hadn't had the time to choose A way to lose But she believes Gonna see the river man Gonna tell him all I can About the plan For lilac time If he tells me all he knows'Bout the way his river flows And all-night shows In summertime Betty said she prayed today For the sky to blow away Or maybe stay She wasn't sureLifting the mask from a local clown Feeling down like him Seeing the light in a station bar And travelling far in sin Sailing downstairs to the northern line Watching the shine of the shoes Hearing the trials of the people there Who's to care if they lose Take a look, you may see me on the ground For I am the parasite of this town Dancing a jig in a church with chimes A sign of the times today Hearing no bell from the steeple tall People all in dismay Falling so far on a silver spoon Making the moon for fun Changing a robe for a size too small People all get hung Take a look, you may see me coming through For I am the parasite who travels two-by-twoI never felt magic crazy as this I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea I never held emotion in the palm of my hand Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree But now you're here Brighten my northern sky I've been a long time that I'm waiting Been a long time that I'm blown I've been a long time that I've wandered Through the people I have known Oh, if you would and you could Straighten my new mind's eye Would you love me for my money Would you love me for my head Would you love me through the winter Would you love me 'til I'm dead Oh, if you would and you could Come blow your horn on high I never felt magic crazy as this I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea I never held emotion in the palm of my hand Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree But now you're here Brighten my northern skyA day once dawned And it was beautiful A day once dawned from the ground Then the night she fell And the air was beautiful The night she fell all around So look see the days The endless colored ways And go play the game that you learned From the morning And now we rise And we are everywhere And now we rise from the ground See she flies And she is everywhere See she flies all around So look, see the sights The endless summer nights And go play the game that you learned From the morningWhich will you go for Which will you love Which will you choose from From the stars above Which will you answer Which will you call Which will you take for For your one and all And tell me now Which will you love the best Which do you dance for Which makes you shine Which will you choose, now If you won't choose mine Which will you hope for Which can it be Which will you take, now If you won't take me And tell me now Which will you love the best You can say the sun is shining if you really want to I can see the moon and it seems so clear You can take a road that takes you to the stars now I can take a road that'll see me through I can take a road that'll see me through You can take a road that takes you to the stars now I can take a road that'll see me through I can take a road that'll see me through I can take a road that'll see me throughI could have been a sailor, could have been a cook A real live lover, could have been a book I could have been a signpost, could have been a clock As simple as a kettle, steady as a rock I could be here and now I would be, I should be, but how I could have been One of these things first I could have been One of these things first I could have been your pillar, could have been your door I could have stayed beside you, could have stayed for more I could have been your statue, could have been your friend A whole long lifetime could have been the end I could be yours so true I would be, I should be, through and through I could have been One of these things first I could have been One of these things first
