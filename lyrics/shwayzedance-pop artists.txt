up pretty Go out and get messed up and shitty Girls by the sea, dress like hippies And rock love beads and go skinny-dippin'Girls in the hills, go day trippin'To get their nails done, and hair straightened Little girls in the 818 Get hot when I roll over Laurel Canyon Let me tell you about a girl I know She like hip-hop and rock 'n' roll She walk slow down the avenue I ain't met her, but I'll get her when I do Let me tell you about a girl I love She stay at home 'cause she hate the club Baby butt, pretty little features I ain't met her but I'll get her when I see herI just wanna fuck

I gotta whole lot of love, but none like you You make me wanna stay here in heaven with you I'll write your name in the sand, put your hand with mine Come on baby, shoot your gun in the sky I met her at a backyard blockparty by the bar And she kept lookin' at me like she knew who I was She was buzzin' all over me She was buzzin' all over me She was buzzin' all over me like she fell in love This is what you call real puppy love Baby I’m not usually a shy dude And I know we ain't in high school No more It’s just a little something that I wrote Saying hey girl I know you don’t know me But maybe we could chill some time Drink a little wine You’ll find Everything you need's right in front of your eyes Got me singing hey girl I know you don’t know me And I bet you get this all the time But I can’t lie Every time you leave I want to press rewind Say ay Ay ay I love you Ay Ay ay I love you See what I was really trying to say was well uhThis heartbreak is better than most loves Cuz even when we break up Our heartbreak is better than most loves Even when we break up You're hot like cashmere, I don't need that beer Drunk off your love and I'm cool chillin' right here In school you never would've talked to me It's cool 'cause now you're gettin' lost with me Your body is just like an hourglass It's crazy how quick an hour pass Know were having fun thinking about the times we had'Cause even when the times were bad I can't forget it, making love in public Let them all see, fuck it They search the world to find something like this Forget it, makin' love in public Let them all see, fuck it They search the world to find something like this Heartbreak is better than most loves'Cause even when we break up Our heartbreak is better than most loves This heartbreak is better than most loves'Cause even when we break up Our heartbreak is better than most loves Even when we break upDirty little girl in her dirty little life Dirty little thoughts in her dirty little mind Dirty little lips tell dirty little lies My dirty little girl  Sure cleans up nice Yeah, high fashion, trash on the street Studio apartment, Penthouse Suite High Class, low life freak, but shit goes on like O-Bla-Di Day and night she walk to the beat, no sleep and you gotta eat Shake it like a tambourine, lemme taste it, little tangerine Some girls like movie stars, some girls like cash and cars Some girls like champagne, some girls like caviar Some girls like other things, dont need no diamond rings All my dirty girls sing:Dirty little girl in her dirty little life Dirty little thoughts in her dirty little mind Dirty little lips tell dirty little lies My dirty little girl Sure cleans up niceSaid it a million times, I hate to see cryin I'd give a million lives to see you smilin'If it were you and I stuck on an island Think I'd be smiling Yo, if it were just you and I play the best of Bob Marley, no woman no cry I make a guitar out of palm trees in case you crash-landed and you couldn't find your i Pod Make a wish upon a starfish, kiss under the waterfall, coconut sidedish, like paradise lost, but now I'm found Everytime I get a little bit closer you drift so far away Everytime I get a little bit closer you leave me right here Everytime I get a little bit closer you drift so far away Everytime I get a little bit closer you leave me right here Like an island in the sun, I'm waiting patiently, waiting for you, to land on me Like an island in the sun, I guess I wait and see, waiting for you, to land on me Collecting seashells on the seafloor Smoke a lil' seaweed on the seashore Just me and you, we don't need more Except the sun and the stars and the wind and the mountains See I'm a real hippie kid so just the two us is something I could dig Building castles in the sky, building castles in the skyDon't wait too long I don't wanna wait til the moments gone I don't wanna play that same love song Over and over Started out good ended up bad You like a pop song all stuck up in my head Finally read the lyrics understood what they meant When I spent all my money and my God damn rent Now I'm tryna figure out if it was worth it Matter of fact I know the answer, it was no bitch Chilling on the island with my feet up on the beach But being raised on the beach couldn't prepare me for these bitches And these sand sharks and how they try to sink they teeth in I'm just body surfing tryin not to hit the reef All they wanna see a brother do is sink But I'm a ride this shit til my shit don't stink I'm a sing my heart out sing til I can't breathe I'm a mean every note even if it's off key Please go head and leave I wouldn't wait for you so don't wait for meLazy days in Los Angeles If it ain't your parents, its the damn police We just want to get our kicks for free We just want to get our kicks for free Well I was walking through Mac Arthur park Looking for some sugar just to cure my heart And after dark I talk to the cabbie Cause he drives me home if I call him daddy And it's alright Just as long as I can get high, sit back and watch the sunset in the sky I don't know if you know what I mean But it's love in Los Angeles Lazy days in Los Angeles If it ain't your parents, it's the damn police We just want to get our kicks for free We just want to get our kicks for free Lazy days in Los Angeles If it ain't your parents, it's the damn police We just want to get our kicks for free We just want to get our kicks for freeIf you got the weed, I got the pipe We can get high together all night If you got the weed I got the light We can get high together all
