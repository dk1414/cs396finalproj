Iesha..You know I want you so bad And there's nothing anyone can do To keep me away from youIn Time magazine, August 23, 1999, evolutionist Stephen Jay Gould asserted that “evolution is as well documented as any phenomenon in science” and “we can call evolution a ‘fact.’” This is typical of the stratagem used by evolutionists: If you make a statement strong enough and repeat it often enough, you may be able to convince yourself and others that it may be true  Yet, despite their dogmatism, there are many knowledgeable people who do not believe that the evidence supports the theory of evolution.Fossils disprove evolution One of the most powerful pieces of evidence against evolution is the fossil record  If evolution occurred by slow, minute changes in living creatures, there would be thousands of times more transitional forms of these creatures in the fossil beds than complete forms  Since the billions of fossils that have been found are all complete forms, the obvious conclusion is: Evolution never occurred  Though evolutionists have stated that there are many transitional forms, this is simply not true  What evolutionists claim to be transitional forms all have fully functional parts  A true transitional form would have non-functioning parts or appendages, such as the nub of a leg or wing.Where are the trillions of fossils of such true transitional forms  Critics often say that creationism is simply religion, whereas evolutionism is based on science  The Bible states in Genesis I that all creatures reproduce “after their kind”   So the complete absence of transitional forms in the fossil record supports creationism  Is this scientific evidence for creationism, or isn’t it Too many questions and no answers It can also be noted that evolutionists only discuss this subject in the broadest terms  If evolution is true, why don’t they give us answers to our many questions Where did all the 90-plus elements  come from  How was it determined how many bonds each element would have for combining with other elements How do you explain the precision in the design of the elements, with increasing numbers of electrons in orbit around the nucleus Where did the thousands of compounds we find in the world come from—carbon dioxide, sodium chloride, calcium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, oxalic acid, chlorophyll, sucrose, hydrogen sulfide, benzene, aluminum silicate, mercaptans, propane, silicon dioxide, boric acid, etc.  They could not have developed from the elements, because elements rarely react with each other  For example, did all the salt in the ocean form by sodium reacting with chlorine    Therefore almost all compounds had to have been created as compounds  When did all the compounds we find in the world develop—before the big bang, during the big bang, after the big bang  When evolutionists use the term “matter,” which of the thousands of compounds is included  When evolutionists use the term “primordial soup,” which of the elements and compounds is included Why do books on evolution, including grade school, high school and college textbooks, not include such important, basic information  Evolutionists are masters of speculation; why don’t they speculate about this Life from non-life How did life develop from non-life Where did the human emotions, such as love, hate and jealousy, come from What are the odds that the evolutionary process, proceeding by random changes, would produce human beings, plus millions of species of animals, birds, fish and insects, all with symmetrical features, i.e., one side being a mirror image of the other  We take symmetry in all these creatures for granted, but is that a reasonable outcome for a random process Spontaneous reproduction What are the odds that, of the millions of species of animals, birds, fish and insects, a male of each species developed at the same time and in the same place as a female of the same species, so that the species could propagate  Why are there two sexes anyhow  This is not foreordained in the evolutionary framework  Is there some sort of plan here  If the first generation of mating species didn’t have parents, how did the mating pair get to that point  Isn’t evolution supposed to progress when an offspring of a mating pair has a beneficial mutation Conclusion: No parents, no evolution  A species would have to jump from a primitive form to a fully developed male and female, each with the ability and instinct to mate.Organ development How did the heart, lungs, stomach, veins, blood, kidneys, etc  develop in the first animal by slow, minute steps and the animal survive while these changes were occurring  For example, did the first animal develop 10 percent of complete veins, then 20 percent, and on up to 100 percent, with veins throughout its entire body and brain  Then how did the heart slowly develop in the animal and get attached to the veins in the right spot  How did the blood enter the system  The blood could not enter before the veins were complete or it would spill out  Where did the blood come from  Did the blood have red corpuscles, white corpuscles, platelets and plasma  At what point in this process of development did the heart start beating Did the animal develop a partial stomach, then a complete stomach  After the stomach was formed, how did the digestive juices enter the stomach  Where did the hydrochloric acid as part of the digestive juices come from  What about its kidney and bladder  The animal better not eat anything prior to this.How did the animal survive during these changes   Of course, at the same time, the animal’s eyes must be fully developed so it can see its food, and its brain must be fully developed so the animal can control its body to get to the food  Like the heart, brain, veins and stomach, all of the organs and systems in the first animal’s body must be fully functional in the first moments of life.The preceding points indicate that evolution couldn’t occur, and the fossil record indicates that it didn’t occur  In other words, if you cannot come up with a detailed, feasible scenario of how the first animal developed, the whole evolutionary theory goes out the window, because it never even could have gotten started  Or is your attitude going to be: Don’t bother me with such details; my mind is made up.Misleading textbooks Why do books on evolution, including biology textbooks, always start with a fully developed animal when attempting to explain how one species developed into another species  Why don’t evolutionists first explain how the first animal developed ?What are the odds that the evolutionary process, proceeding by random changes, would produce a system in human reproduction whereby exactly 50 percent of offspring are male and 50 percent are female   Again, is there some sort of plan here To a creationist, the incredible complexity of human life, plant life and the universe is absolutely overwhelming evidence that there must have been a designer  Additional evidence for a designer: The law of gravity is basic to an understanding of the universe.Who invented gravity Where did the law of gravity come from  Did it have a beginning  Isn’t it reasonable to assume that when matter was created, the law of gravity was established at the same time to regulate matter  Further evidence: The earth receives an incredible amount of energy from the sun, even though the sun is 93,000,000 miles away  Yet the earth only receives one part in two trillion of the sun’s total energy  And since the sun is only an average star among the 100 trillion billion stars in the universe, the total energy in all these stars is absolutely beyond human comprehension  Where did this energy come from  Isn’t the only reasonable answer that it was the result of a creative act by an almighty designer/creator Evolution—A solution by default Why do evolutionists summarily dismiss the evidence of design without any serious consideration  Professor D.M.S  Watson, zoologist and Chair of Evolution at University College London, has given us some insight as to why this is so  He said, “Evolution  a theory universally accepted not because it can be proved by logically coherent evidence to be true, but because the only alternative, special creation, is clearly incredible.” This, of course, is an admission that the foundation of evolution is not science, but a rejection of the supernatural  Evolution then is simply the best alternative anyone has been able to come up with  This also means that evolution is the only field in science where one decides on the answer first, and then looks for evidence to support that predetermined answer.Other than rejection of the supernatural, how else can one explain the steadfast adherence of evolutionists to this theory even though they do not know the origin of the three main bases of evolution: the origin of matter, the origin of energy and the origin of life Truth or dare If you believe in evolution, can you give just one coercive proof, i.e., a proof that absolutely eliminates any other possible explanation for the origin of the universe, the material world, and human life Isn’t it true that, rather than “proofs” of evolution, all that evolutionists can come up with are “evidences” for evolution to someone who already believes in it Let’s see some answers to important questions such as these posed in this article, rather than a discussion of what is science and what is religion  That type of discussion is entirely irrelevant  What we seek is the truth, and creationism is a far more reasonable and logical explanation of the origin of the universe, the material world and human life.N OT E T O S TU DE NT S: Make a copy of this challenge to
