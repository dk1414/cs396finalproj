stand by your lover When he has what it takes to deceive When he's always been all that you've known But never been all that you need And though I'll thank you forever Still I need to be sure That it was there, somewhere inside of me There, unbroken and pure If every life is a story How long will I wait For your slight admiration To reach its natural fate Is it time to feel your own power Time to rip it apart Can you stand still in the fire When it's time to break your own heart Now all I have is a mirror And all I can see are the tears All that's left is the madness That reflects through the yearsHey, does it ever make you wonder what's on my mind I was only ever running back to your side I never cried, I just watched my life go by It's just a pack of lies, cos you're leaving me behind Why, after this long is there nothing I'll keep Oh I can shout, you'll pretend you're asleep I live a lie, yeah, believing that you're mine It's just a waste of time, cos you're leaving me behind Hey, there's not a cloud in the sky It's as blue as your goodbye And I thought that it would rain On a day like today...Hey there's not a cloud in sight It's as blue as your blue goodbye And I thought that it would rain The day you went away...Hey does it ever make you wonder what's on my mind Oooo, oooh, I was only ever running back to your side He's on the buses and the aeroplanes With some groceries and a sleeping bagMaybe it's time to swallow my pride Maybe it's time to turn the tide Maybe I'm a slow learner A slow burner Maybe I'm an only child Maybe you're sublime Maybe you'd be mine Maybe your the fortunate son Maybe you're blind Maybe you're unkind Mybe you just won't see Theres one thing that I know for sure I don't need this crowd anymore You're the only one I want knocking at my door So please come on, come in Maybe you're the captain of a sailing ship Maybe you're lost at sea Maybe it's a shame Maybe I'm to blame Maybe it's just meant to be Maybe you're the star of some downbeat show Maybe I'm your only fan Maybe I'm a siren ringing in your ear Maybe you're a haunted man Theres one thing that I know for sure I don't need this crowd anymore You're the only one I want knocking at my door So please come on, come in Don't take pot shots at me, I'm innocent Or target me for things I can't prevent I'm not the author of your discontent But theres one thing that I know for sure I don't need this crowd anymore You're the only one I want knocking at my door So please come on, come inMy feet drag under me I walk with my chin to the ground'Cause you got tired of the pain Now you live in harmony And my eyes are coloured in white And your hands are colder than ice And the walls come tumbling down And our worlds came crashing around And the angels fall from the sky Token angels in disguise In a dream we were at sea On a boat that was sinking fast You sailed out over the ocean And I was tied to the mast And my eyes are coloured in white And your hands are colder than ice And the walls came tumbling down And our worlds came crashing around And the angels fall from the sky Token angels in disguiseDo the things that keep a smile on her face Say the things that

think of me, smile It's the only way that i can see That you still care for me I close my eyes, never to sleep I tell you all the things I should have said But you'll never know How could I act such a
