Have you ever been stabbed in the back By someone you thought was really cool Did they steal your lover  Or was it money Or was it lies they told Strangers just disguised as your friends Never again, 'cause now you know, that...Friends will let you down Friends won't be around When you need them most Where are your friends Oh, friends are hard to find Friends yours and mine I'm talking 'bout your friends Smiles they hide behind Never know what's on their mind Could be true deception Jealousy and envy reign Never want to see you get ahead They just hold you back Friends will let you down Friends won't be around When you need them most Where are your friends Oh, friends are hard to find Friends yours and mine I'm talking 'bout your friendsLately I feel so all alone Can't find the joy You know that I'd be with you now If I had the choice I know I hurt you when I said goodbye And I don't know the reason I ever stopped believing I never needed anyone but you, oh I was too blind to see When you belonged to me You were my everything Now I'd give anything To feel the love you bring You were my everything They say time can mend a broken heart And fix you up But my life could never ever be the same Without your touchWhen I first laid my eyes upon you I knew right then and there you were the one Eyes so deep, you sent me melting And then you smiled as though to say, "oh yeah"But then you seemed to change your mind You looked away like you were oh, so shy Is the game you're playing hard to get Won't you tell me, oh ho Want me, don't you want me To touch you and to hold you tight Don't you want me like I want you To kiss and love all through the night I'd like to know more than just your name Did you come here alone or with someone If only you would open up And let me know just where you're coming from Are you looking for a new love Or does commitment seem to bring you down Is that a look of "yes" or is it "no"?Please don't tease me, ohI gave you love You did me wrong I didn't know what to do But baby, I'm strong I'll get over you A new boy I'm gonna choose You'll see My love was true Still you threw it all away Now other guys will have me They'll appreciate my love Tell me, how does it feel You know that I needed you You know that you meant the world to me You know I had to have you Now I'm gonna find somebody new I'm looking for a new love, baby A new love, yeah, yeah, yeah I'm looking for a new love, baby A new love, yeah, yeah, yeahI've been around for quite some time Patiently waiting for you to settle down But my patience is starting to wear very thin From stories of your women time and time again Bridge:So don't take my love for granted Or you might lose a good thing I'm trying to do the best I can for you And when you stop playing around You'll really know it's true Chorus:That I'm the one you need baby I'm the one you need baby If you look inside your heart You'll really it's true That I'm the one you need baby'Cause I care for you I live for you I'm not out to get your money'Cause I buy my own clothes and I pay my own rent All I want from you is love and affection That'll keep us moving in the right directionI said I would get over you Now I'm here out on my own Trying to live my life And now you wanna come back But I don't need no brand new lies, listen up I want a love that's serious No time to play love games I don't wanna be nobody's fool So if you wanna be with me You gotta give it up Real love I know I wanna have one Real love Gonna try and get some Real love Everybody needs one Real love Got to have real love All my friends are telling me I should give you another try But I don't need opinions To deal with what I have on my mind, listen upWhen a man loves a woman They say she could do no wrong When a man loves a woman Her nights will never be long When a man loves a woman He makes love with pure intensity And if she wants He'll do what you do When a man loves a woman He's not afraid of his vulnerability When a man loves a woman He loves their intertwining sexuality When a man loves a woman He might let her see him cry And he'll never risk losing her By telling some stupid lie He won't do you wrong He'll love you longI never knew what I was missing Love with no passion in the kissing I can't explain it, how you made me open up And you showed me things I never thought I'd do, ho I'd hate to think of ever losing you'Cause there is no one that makes me feel the way you do You're some kinda lover Turn me on, turn me out You're some kinda lover Make me feel, oh, so real Hold me and tell me that you love me Only with you is where I wanna be We'll light a candle as a symbol of our love Then we'll move real close like in a perfect fantasy I wish these moments could go on and on and on But before you leave I want you to knowYou made a promise That you'd never desert me So where are you now You built me up Then you left me standing all alone Lost in the crowd My friends all say to forget you I should but why do I hurt so No one wins when the love is lost You turned your back on me When I needed you most of all No one wins when love takes a fall How could you let me down I needed you most of all Maybe I should learn to live life without you Find someone new But something happens deep inside when our eyes meet I know you feel it too Don't try and say you're happy without me Don't say you don't miss my love, boy No one wins when the love is lost You turned your back on me When I needed you most of all No one wins when love takes a fall How could you let me down I needed you most of allCan I talk to you There's something that I want to say And I've wanted to say it for a long time Would I be too forward if I moved a little closer Whispered gently what I want you to do to me Can I take your hands and place them Gently near my heart as it beats anticipating My thoughts, my love, my soul My fears undressed before you And all I want to do is lose them inside you Let me show you how I wanna be loved If I were to open up to you, baby Would you still think of me as a lady Take me in your arms, hold me tight Love me tonight, over and over, yeah Just take me in your arms Love me, oh, so slow I know a woman ain't supposed To express the way she feels When it comes to making love And I don't want to try and change you Just enhance the things you do so well'Cause you're my man, gonna be together Pray for always What I'm trying to do here is just communicate My thoughts, my soul, my body Is undressed before you Now that I've opened up to you, baby Do you still think of me as a lady
