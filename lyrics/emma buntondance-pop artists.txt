need it, there's plenty fish in the seaIf I told you how I feel about you Would you say the same and If I wrote it in a letter Would you keep it or throw it away I never thought I'd feel the way I'm feeling lately When everything you seem to do just drives me crazy Every waking day you take my breath away With every word you say you take my breath away You look at me that way, baby come what may I hope that you'll always know how to take my breath away How to take my breath away If you told me how you feel about me Things I did not know If you said you'd fill my heart with all your loving Til it overflowed I don't know the way you feel but boy I'm hoping I always used to hide a way, but now I'm openLove is a serious game I don't know the rules you were playing I gave you the keys to my heart You tore it apart And I never thought we'd end this But you know that I can't stay'Cause there's there's too many teardrops I've cried I could have filled me an ocean Now I'm leaving this heartache behind I might be bruised, but I won't be broken There's too many teardrops I've cried over you Over you I'm not afraid of the fire But I saw the flames getting higher I know we started with sparks But you pushed me too far But I got my eyes wide open And I have to walk away'Cause there's there's too many teardrops I've cried I could have filled me an ocean Now I'm leaving this heartache behind I might be bruised, but I won't be broken There's too many teardrops I've cried over you Over youPeople say Never watch and wait When the pressures on You know it won't find you Fate is shy When you seek it high When you're looking left It'll creep up on the right So I found out for myself That all the tales were true You came without a warning Not a clue Wasn't looking when I found love Yeah it took me by suprise Wasn't looking when you showed up Now you're all I see Wasn't looking you took my hand The way it should be Wasn't looking when I found love And it's beautifulBeing with you Longing for something to happen Biding my time Hoping to get a reaction Atmosphere's tense Heavy with anticipation Don't leave me here With only my imagination Free me Now free me Let me loose to love you Yeah how I long to seduce you oh Free me Let me loose to love you Yeah how I long to seduce you now How long can I continue to suffer in silence My aching heart Can't bear to awaiting such suspenseAll the simple things you say Taken all my breath away So I've come back to stay All the little things you do Keeps me running back to you Cos I belong with you This is something that's quite beautiful Found what I've been looking for Like the sunshine, it's so wonderful In my heart I feel it, something that's so beautiful Something so beautiful Something so beautiful This is a place where I can lay Puts a smile upon my face Keeps me warm and safe Time is proof is that we're not wrong I never felt like I was gone I'm back where I belongI know that you can hear the rhythm of the rain Although we're miles apart, I know you feel my pain I try to be so strong, I try to carry on But since you left the sun don't seem to shine My tears are falling on the words you wrote to me I wish that somehow they could take me where I wanna be It seems so long ago, you held me when I cried For now I just pretend you're by my side, oh-oh yeah Everything that I touch turns to blue When I'm living in a world without you I'm going crazy baby, I am missing you Can't imagine all I go through When I'm living in a world without you I'm not alone I know that you can feel it too La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la I try to watch a movie but you're all that I can see In my dreams I know I always see you constantly But then a dream comes to an end and I'm alone And I can't seem to let this feeling go, whoa-oh babyHey Maria Papa said You better go to bed Maria Mama said You better go to bed And little sister said You better go to bed The older brother said You heard what Papa said You better say
