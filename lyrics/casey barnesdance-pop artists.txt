Right from the minute I saw you, I was in And now I can't stop thinking about ya Yeah, I'm thinking about ya Oh, all the time Something 'bout the way you walked into the place Swear the birds were singing around ya Yeah, singing around ya I think I know why I wanna take my chances with ya Loved up, late night dances with ya Find out what you hide behind those eyes I wanna get to know ya Tell me what you're all about I wanna get to know ya Your hopes, your dreams, your doubts And figure out all of the tiny little things that you're thinkin'How your heart beats in your chest when you're kissin'Everything that makеs you who you are Ooh, I wanna get to know ya, oh I wanna get to know ya, ohI've been thirsty for your love Tried a few sides but nothing else fills me up Like when it's you, when it's us I can't tell you why it feels right, it just does Put a kiss on me, sweet release Heaven sent an angel to set me free Sipping slow, red wine, take your time I love the thought of you alone waiting for me I get shaking bones when I'm halfway home Just thinking 'bout your love feels like a drug I'm happy to be on I can't slow it down, girl, I'm back in town I've been around the world, seen lots of girls You stand alone, so come turn me on So come turn me on Yeah All my senses keep running wild Think you've done all you'll do to me, then you smile Lord, help me, 'cause I'm a mess You could put a grown man inside the ground in that dress Here we go One, two, three, go Hey Pocket fire lady, danger in her eyes Rock 'n' roll baby, born a little wild Dancing with the devil, got me on my knees All them country boys ae praying, Jesus, help me, please Can't tie her down She's a fire that won't burn out That girl's a weapon, one shot of heaven Straight to my soul Pour another one drink you down That girl is thunder, hot chili momma'Cause in she rolls and I'm gone Gone, gone, gone Yeah, gone Gone, gone, goneI've been buried deep, six feet down Drank the devil's tea, I was down for the count Know the Reaper well, won't stop knockin'Told him, "Go to Hell, I'ma keep on walkin'"I was dead and gone Long way from home I was knocked to the ground But you can't keep the good ones down Light it up, light it up Pour some diesel on the fire, turn it into the sun Light it up, light it up Don't you worry about the burn, 'cause it's half of the fun Light it up, light it up Hit the bottoms up, tastes so sweet Ready to rumble, throw the lion to the sheep On a mountaintop, won't come down Pedal to the metal, you ain't catching me now I was dead and gone Long way from home I was knocked to thе ground But you can't keep the good ones downYeah Oh, man, another long day About to get paid Put the boots in the back That's right Taking all the back roads On the way home I'll be there in a flash Gonna grab some whisky Drink it straight, don't mix it'Cause when the sun goes down, we play And I can't wait These summer nights, no doubt about it We 'bout to have one hell of a party Man, the good times just getting started now Beers on ice, and your favourite song We'll light up the fire and sing along I can't wait for the weekend to come around So bring on those summer nights Aw, yeah Bring on those summer nights Those summеr nightsThis story ain't my own It's one about calling a small town home When you grow up dreaming 'bout singing your songs on a six string It's a tale as old as time It's was dad's and now it's mine Its the only life I've ever really known 'bout living I wasn't the first, I won't be the last So raise your glass To boys like me Grew up running around these streets Buying faking I Ds and wasting money on Girls and cars and beer Boys like me Yeah, we're working for the weekends All our friends are old friends and life's pretty sweet There'll always be boys like me Oh-oh Oh-oh There'll always be boys like meI got a fever down in my soul Everybody talkin' 'bout things they don't know I can't take the weight on me, brother In one ear and out of the other All I know is that I'm going crazy at home Day one, had a little alcohol Day two, took a pill to sleep it off Day three, got a little booty call I can't stop If you like some rock in your roll I'I I make you the star of the show We'll play ten nights, sold out together They'll be singing our songs forever We're gonna leave 'em wanting some more Baby, this ain't the encore Man, it feels good to be on the road Rolling through anothеr town we don't know One day leads to anothеr Cold beer for lunch and whisky for supper If I had a say, I'd never go homeIt's like a fantasy It's more than chemistry My heart, it won't stop knockin'I'I I take you out with me Black boots and skinny jeans We'll get the whole town talkin'A little whisky as the sun goes down Girl, let me chase it with you You got a hold on me Already on my knees And I just keep on falling I'm a love fool I hang on every word that you say Think you're so cool Yeah, I'ma do whatever it takes Touch you is levitation Give you my dedication Baby, you can have it your way I'm a love fool I hang on every word that you sayWe've been at it like this for days You don't call, I just drink I could say things I don't mean to say But that ain't gonna make you stay If let my heart speak, you're not the enemy There ain't no one gonna take your place I'll tell you honestly, I'm never gonna leave Even in your darkest day A little light can ignite another A little love goes a long way Nothing works when we fight each other Only love can make it okay When it hurts, in the worst Be the first to forgive and forget And just let it go A little light can ignite another So take my heart and set it up in flames Take my heart and set it up in flames, oh yeah We've all heard just how the story goes When love don't win and hearts grow cold I don't want it to be me and you I know what gotta doCall it the whisky, or call it the wine But got a spark in my heart that you light up every time They're calling me crazy and maybe it's true But the only thing crazy's the way I feel bout you From all your kisses on my neck, way you whisper under your breath Way the world slows down when you walk in to a room You got that kind of love that makes me know it's true When heaven dreamt you up, god took his time on you It's in the way we touch, it's in the way you move When heaven dreamt you up, god took his time on you He took his time on you So put on your perfumе, you know the one that I love Put on a song and wе'll dance 'round the room 'til the sun comes up They say nothing is perfect, but you're damn near close How lucky I am I man that in this life I'm the one you chose So while you're kissing on my neck, let me whisper under my breath"Girl, you're everything to me and you should know"
