Last night your shadow fell upon my lonely room I touched your golden hair and tasted your perfume Your eyes were filled with love, the way they used to be Your gentle hand reached out to comfort me Then came the dawn And you were gone You were gone, gone, gone I had too much to dream last night Too much to dream I'm not ready to face the light I had too much to dream Last night Last night The room was empty as I staggered from my bed I could not bear the image racing through my head You were so real that I could feel your eagerness And when you raised your lips for me to kiss Came the dawn And you were gone You were gone, gone, goneOnie, I thought I knew you What's happened to you You're not the same Onie, why don't you own up You're not yet grown up Why play a game The years will find you if you let them Don't try to get them before your time Onie, don't lose what you got By being something you're not Onie, why don't you own up You're not yet grown up Why play a game Do all the fun things, seek out the laughter And grow up after your youth is gone Onie, I like you a lot But don't be something you're notHoly are you Holy are you There is no God but you There is no God but you Praise be the Lord Holy are you Holy are you There is no God but you There is no God but you Praise be the Lord Holy are you Holy are you There is no God but you There is no God but you Praise be the

You want to know, will the sun keep glowin' ?Will the rain keep rainin' and the wind keep blowin' ?Can a man change the minds of men ?Can you go where you've never been ?Come ride the train for tomorrow Will our children have the chance to pray When tomorrow becomes today ?There's no use runnin' 'cause you can't hide The track's too long and there's coal inside Inside the train for tomorrow We're waiting for that common freight Each time that we anticipate The knock upon our door that means the future of our dreamsHere I go, higher, higher Here I go, higher, higher Here I go, oh, oh, oh, oh You gotta get me to the world on time You gotta get me to the world on time The minute you walk in the room I break into a sweat My hands begin to shake so bad I can't light my cigarette Then you start walkin' towards me And my cool comes all undone If I could get my feet to move I'd turn around and run My pulse is beatin' faster And I'm headin' for disaster Here I go, higher, higher Here I go, higher, higher, here I go Get me to the world on time You gotta get me to the world on timeQueen bee you give so much honey I'd never feel your sting But is it true you can overdo Too much of a

her little shoes My poor heart is feelin' sad To know that once she could be had If I'd had the price to pay her dues Sold, sold, sold to the highest bidder Sold, sold, sold to the gold and glitter Going, going, going, going Gone See the mansion on the hill The brand new shiny Coupe de Ville Bought and paid for by the upper classes The price is going up, up, up In searchin' for a bigger cup Her greedy little heart has lost it's glasses
