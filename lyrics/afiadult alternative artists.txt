Hey  Miss Murder, can I, hey  Miss Murder, can I Make  beauty stay if I take my life  Ho-oh-oh With just a look, they shook, and heavens bowed before him Simply a look can break your heart The stars that pierce the sky, he left them all behind We’re left to wonder why he left us all behind Hey  Miss Murder, can I, hey  Miss Murder, can I Make  beauty stay if I take my life  Ho-oh-oh Dreams of his crash won’t pass, oh, how they all adored him Beauty will last when spiraled down The stars that mystify, he left them all behind And how his children cried, "He left us all behind!"Hey  Miss Murder, can I, hey  Miss Murder, can I Make  beauty stay if I take my life  Ho-oh-oh...What's the hook, the twist within this verbose mystery I would gladly bet my life upon it That the ghost you love, your ray of light will fizzle out Without hope We're the empty set just floating through empty skin Ever searching for what we were promised Reaching for that golden ring, we'd never let go But who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it I'll lay me down tonight Much further down Swim in the calm tonight This art does drown me as the whitest lace of light just begs to be imbrued has led me to this place Where I belong, with all erased What follows All insects sing tonight The coldest sound I'd send God's grace tonight Could it be found  me as the whitest lace of light just begs to be imbrued has led me to this place Where I belong, with all erased I'll lay me down tonight Much further down Watch stars go out tonight On sinking groundI came here by day But I left here in darkness And found you, found you on the way And now, it is silver and silent It is silver and cold You, in somber resplendence, I hold Your sins into me Oh, my beautiful one Your sins into me As a rapturous voice escapes, I will tremble a prayer And I'll beg for forgiveness Your sins into me Oh, my beautiful one Light, like the flutter of wings Feel your hollow voice rushing into me As you're longing to sing So, I I will paint you in silver I will wrap you in cold I will lift up your voice as I sinkDon't waste your touch, you won't feel anything Or were you sent to save me I've thought too much, you won't find anything Worthy of redeeming Yo he estado aquí muchas veces antes y regresó To break down, and cease all feeling Burn now, what once was breathing Reach out, and you may take my heart away Imperfect cry, and scream in ecstasy So what befalls the flawless Look what I've built It shines so beautifully Now watch as it destroys me Y regreso aquí otra vez y comienzo To break down, and cease all feeling Burn now, what once was breathing Reach out, and you may take my heart awayI remember when I was told of story of Crushed velvet, candle wax, and dried up flowers The figure on the bed all dressed up in roses, calling Beckoning to sleep, offering a dream Words were as mystical as purring animals The circle of rage, the ghosts on the stage appeared The time was so tangible, I'll never let it go Ghost stories handed down reached secret tunnels below No one could see me I fell into yesterday Our dreams seemed not far away I want to, I want to, I want to stay I fell into fantasy Words were as mystical as purring animals The circle of rage, the ghosts on the stage appeared The time was so tangible, I'll never let it go Ghost stories handed down reached secret tunnels below No one could see me I fell into yesterday Our dreams seemed not far away I want to, I want to, I want to stay I fell into fantasyLove your hate, your faith lost You are now one of us Love your hate, your faith lost You are now one of us Nothing from nowhere, I'm no one at all Radiate, recognize one silent call As we all form one dark flame Incinerate Nothing from nowhere, I'm no one at all Radiate, recognize one silent call As we all form one dark flame As we all form one dark flame As we all Love your hate, your faith lost You are now one of us Love your hate, your faith lost You are now one of usWarn your warmth to turn away Here, it's December every day Press your lips to the sculptures And surely, you'll stay For of sugar and ice I am made, I am made I met my love before I was born He bit my lip, and drank my warmth From years before, from years before She exhales vanilla lace I barely dreamt her, yesterday Read the lines in the mirror through the lipstick trace She said, "It seems you're somewhere far away," to his face I met my love before I was born She bit my lip, and drank my warmth From years before, from years beforeOf late, it's harder just to go outside To leave this dead space with hatred, so alive Writhing with sickness, thrown into banality, I decay Killed by the weakness, but forced to return, turn it off I watch the stars as they fall from the sky I held a fallen star and it wept for me, dying I feel the fallen stars encircle me, now as they cry Out there, so quickly, grows malignant tribes Post-human extinction excels, unrecognized Feeling surrounded, so bored with mortality, I decay All of this hatred is fucking real, turn it on, yeah I watch the stars as they fall from the sky I held a fallen star and it wept for me, dying I feel the fallen stars encircle me, now as they cryHey  Miss Murder, can I, hey  Miss Murder, can I Make  beauty stay if I take my life  Ho-oh-oh With just a look, they shook, and heavens bowed before him Simply a look can
