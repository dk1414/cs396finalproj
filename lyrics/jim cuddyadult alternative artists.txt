There's paper scattered on the lawn Birds up on the line There's letters left unopened here There never is the time There's messages I should return And people I should call I'm still tripping over echoes Left lying in the hall There's a light comes Through the darkness Slowly to my eyes You can fall back here forever I just never realized Time won't let me go And every night I know That you could pull me through You could always pull me through Even when I'm lying here Drowning in my blues You take the sting out of the rain And bring the sun back up again You could always pull me throughSister's got her baby now and I'm glad for what she did But her older one's in trouble, man I really love that kid Maybe he could live here, for us it would be nice He needs some time to grow up, needs a father in his life Me I guess I'm lucky, mine have almost grown It's amazing what they turn into from a seed that we have sown I remember nights just lying there, worrying a while I look across the room now, and I see them and I smile All we ever want at night's our families to be safe So we hold their hands and pick them up until they take their place We know that there's no promises, no no guarantees So we pray and pray and pray at night whatever will be will be Oh look at it coming down, making a mess of this whole town And I think that I know why Everyone watched the wedding, two people in love Two people whose blessing comes from higher up above They're not like you and me, they were destined to be Oh everyone watched the wedding, couldn't get enough At least for one moment we were right there up above Looking down on all the royal fuss Monday we were back upon the bus Driving through the neighbourhoods and factories that are us That one day, hope was all that we could see And they looked so beautiful to me Hope was all that we could see And they looked so beautiful to meLast Friday they had a masquerade Everyone was there All decked out in stars and silver Moonlight in their hair Darkness fell down around us We were lost in the mystery Left our clothes by the side of the road And jumped into the sea Wash me down Wash me down Take me away from the beating drums Let the great world go by Wash me down Wash me down And when you go I will never forget I heard a rumour ‘bout a miracle In a town by the Buffalo Leap People came from miles around To watch the statue weep They filled the square with their caravans Cameras lit up the trees Every time a light went off They fell down to their kneesYou and me we're not much for talking Quiet smiles and silent walking Riding the waves of sunshine in our time I was driving the dream down the West Coast mountains Dropping a coin in every fountain Moving along til you came on my mind But it's all right now That was the way we were There's no sense in changing it now Maybe sometime Maybe sometime Maybe sometime We followed the moon all the way to Golden Slept outside til we were almost frozen Watching the sun come up over Lake Louise Stories will end and we'll never know just why There's never the chance to say good-bye Maybe sometime Maybe sometime Maybe sometimeEveryone knows it, try not to show it This city can bring you down I’m a believer some days are hard, but I couldn’t leave this town I got a skyscraper soul Like a flower that comes where the sun never goes A Skyscraper soul Filling my heart where there once was a hole Look out my window Watching the sun go down On the crowds below I know the struggle Weaving through trouble Life can be hard, I know I got a skyscraper soul There’s mud in my veins and there’s steel in my bones Skyscraper soul Building it all up from water and stones Look through the market stalls Over broken walls To this hollowed ground Looks are deceiving There’s a heart beating Here in this battered townI’m sitting by the window with the echoes in my ears Your footsteps walking down the hall Maybe there were words that could have dried up all our tears I couldn’t find them at all I’ve made up my mind I can’t do this anymore Can’t watch the damage we do I’ve wandered so long wondering where I might belong Cause I know it’s not here with you So sweep me away like the wind blows the leaves Just like the seasons gone by I’m not one of those who can easily go I need to know you’ll be fine I’ve made up my mind I can’t do this anymore Can’t watch the damage we do I’ve wandered so long wondering where I might belong Cause I know it’s not here with you I’ve made up my mind I can’t do this anymore Not after all we’ve been through I can’t risk any more time and it’s always on my mind I know it’s not here with you I’ve mixed up all the memories of the things that we have done Can’t quite believe them anymore And I’m stunned by the beauty of you standing across the room Even as I’m closing the door I’ve made up my mind I can’t do this anymore Can’t watch the damage we do I have wandered so long wondering where I might belong Cause I know it’s not here with you I’ve made up my mind I can’t do this anymore Not after all we’ve been through I can’t risk any more time and it’s always on my mind But I know it’s not here with youStuck out by the highway A cheap hotel room too Lock all the doors and windows Still the desperation's coming through Hard night in Denver You got a friend in New Orleans Sometimes the skylines never look the way they look inside your dreams I don't know where we go from this point on So many hours are lost and days that are gone When you come around again Will I be waiting Well some things are hard to explain Anticipating That loneliness finds a way Of changing your mind Waking up in strange rooms With hours left to kill Write down in a letter all those things you want to do but never will Meet all the djs Remember all the names Lay down your head at night and wonder if tomorrow'll be the same Now as I close my bedroom door I'm hearing your voice on the phone with me wanting moreAt least we had the sense to know what's done is done Now I'm not saying we never had fun We made love like a speeding train but we'd end up back on earth again It oughtta've been easy when we got together Sign all the papers, and on with forever No real reason to drink a lot Well wake up honey, see what we've got Oh my I remember this we don't have any wedding bliss Wake up there's some things we gotta set right Sixteen bottles and a wedding trunk Oughtta be a law against marrying drunk Honey, we got married again last night You always told me we should follow our own minds But that was you staying out late and me always left behind Fussin' and fightin' about the same old stuff Six months in I'd had enough Now I'm waking up here in the blinding heat A ring on my finger in the wedding suite The same old trouble lying next to me With a copy of the license and the registry Oh my I remember that kiss But where do we go after this Wake up there's some things we gotta set right Sixteen bottles and a wedding trunk Oughtta be a law against marrying drunk Honey, we got married again last nightTake me down to the riverside Wash me up from this dusty ride I'll pitch my tent in a field nearby When I see you all my spirit starts to fly Ah the moment comes Somebody jumps somebody waits too long It might never come again Once I saw myself as someone dying to be freed But you have led me here and that's all I need Rolling across this graceful land Phone calls home won't understand Waving flags don't mean that much Not like the thrill you get from a stranger's touch All the world you held The way you see yourself You know that you're bound to change You might never be the same When I look outside I see myself in the fear and greed But you have led me here And that's all I needYou were born on a windswept morn Under the summer sky They moved you past all the kids in your class You never even asked why Oh the golden days Lying awake at night Hearing the ocean spray Nobody counting the lives you've cost No mothers crying for sons they've lost Nobody watching at all Just you and the road as it curves and bends Doing little jobs for your daddy's friends One day when the world is right We're going to walk in the bright blue light When your kingdom's gone And your friends moved on We're going to watch you fall We're going to watch it all One fine day Stuck your hand in a desert land Hoping that liberty shines Counting the sins of the ones you put in Sweeping the roads for mines
