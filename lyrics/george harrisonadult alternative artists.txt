My sweet Lord Mmm, my Lord Mmm, my Lord I really wanna see you Really wanna be with you Really wanna see you, Lord But it takes so long, my Lord My sweet Lord Mmm, my Lord Mmm, my Lord I really wanna know you I'd really wanna go with you I really wanna show you, Lord That it won't take long, my Lord My sweet Lord Mmm, my Lord My sweet Lord Isn't it a pity Now isn't it a shame How we break each other's hearts and cause each other pain How we take each other's love without thinking anymore Forgetting to give back Isn't it a pity Some things take so long, but how do I explain When not too many people can see we're all the same And because of all their tears Their eyes can't hope to see the beauty that surrounds them Isn't it a pity Isn't it a pity Isn't it a shame How we break each other's hearts and cause each other pain How we take each other's love without thinking anymore Forgetting to give back Isn't it a pity Forgetting to give back Isn't it a pity Forgetting to give back Now, isn't it a pity Sunrise doesn't last all morning A cloudburst doesn't last all day Seems my love is up and has left you with no warning It's not always gonna be this gray All things must pass All things must pass away Sunset doesn't last all evening A mind can blow those clouds away After all this, my love is up and must be leaving It's not always gonna be this gray All things must pass All things must pass away All things must pass None of life's strings can last So, I must be on my way and face another day Now the darkness only stays at nighttime In the morning it will fade away Daylight is good at arriving at the right time It's not always gonna be this grayWhat I feel, I can't say But my love is there for you anytime of day But if it's not love that you need Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed Tell me, what is my life without your love And tell me, who am I without you by my side What I know, I can do If I give my love now to everyone like you But if it's not love that you need Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed Tell me, what is my life without your love And tell me, who am I without you by my side Tell me, what is my life without your love And tell me, who am I without you by my side What I feel, I can't say But my love is there for you anytime of day But if it's not love that you need Then I'll try my best to make everything succeedWah-wah You've given me a wah-wah And I'm thinking of you And all the things that we used to do Wah-wah, wah-wah Wah-wah You made me such a big star Being there at the right time Cheaper than a dime Wah-wah, you've given me your wah-wah, wah-wah Oh, you don't see me crying Oh, you don't hear me sighing Wah-wah I don't need no wah-wah And I know how sweet life can be If I keep myself free Wah-wah I don't need no wah-wahWatch out now, take care Beware of falling swingers Dropping all around you The pain that often mingles in your fingertips Beware of darkness Watch out now, take care Beware of the thoughts that linger Winding up inside your head The hopelessness around you In the dead of night Beware of sadness It can hit you It can hurt you Make you sore and what is more That is not what you are here for Watch out now, take care Beware of soft shoe shufflers Dancing down the sidewalks As each unconscious sufferer Wanders aimlessly Beware of MayaI'm shoutin' all about love While they treated you like a dog When you were the one who had made it so clear All those years ago Talkin' all about how to give They don't act with much honesty But you point the way to the truth when you say All you need is love Living with good and bad I always looked up to you Now we're left cold and sad By someone, the devil's best friend Someone who offended all We're living in a bad dream They've forgotten all about mankind And you were the one they backed up to the wall All those years ago You were the one who imagined it all All those years agoI got my mind set on you I got my mind set on you I got my mind set on you Got my mind set on you But it's going to take money A whole lot of spending money It's going to take plenty of money To do it right, child It's going to take time Whole lot of precious time It's going to take patience and time Mmm, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it To do it right, child I got my mind set on you I got my mind set on you I got my mind set on you I got my mind set on you And this time I know it's for real The feeling that I feel I know if I put my mind to it I know that I really can do itEveryone has choice When to or not to raise their voices It's you that decides Which way you will turn While feeling that our love's not your concern It's you that decides No one around you Will carry the blame for you No one around you Will love you today and throw it all away Tomorrow when you rise Another day for you to realise me Or send me down again As the days stand up on end You've got me wondering how I lost your friendship But I see it in your eyes Though I'm beside you I can't carry the blame for you I may decide to Get out with your blessing Where I'll carry on guessingOne  Two!Back then long time ago when grass was green Woke up in a daze Arrived like strangers in the night Long time ago when we was fab Back when income tax was all we had Caresses fleeced you in the morning light Casualties at dawn And we did it all Long time ago when we was fab You are my world, you are my only love And while you're in this world The fuzz gonna come and claim you But you mo' better wise When the buzz gonna come and take you away Take you away, take you away
