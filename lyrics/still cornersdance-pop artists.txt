Time has come to go Pack your bags, hit the open road Our hearts just won't die It's the trip keeps us alive Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh So many miles So many miles So many miles Away The falling sun burns a line Tearing into the night Watching you fall asleep The sweetest dove in a dream Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh-oohI love to drive the highways The skyways just to get lost I pass so many places But won't brake 'cause I can't break your heart Drivin' till dawn Call you from the station Leavin' you a message that I'm gone I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone Gone I'm gone I'm gone Seasons change so fast They don't last And the leaves always fall Today is a new day And there's a clear way And the road is long Drivin' till dawn Call you from the station Leavin' you a message that I'm goneTurning back into the tide Watching the beach from the other side We swim with the moon To an island on the black lagoon Dreaming as the hours fade away Watching as the sunlight does the same Everything we are is on the line Let's pretend it's not us tonight Can't get away Can't get away Can't get away Can't get away Running back into the tide Sapphire eyes up the sudden night We swim with the moon To an island on the black lagoon Can't get away Can't get away Can't get away Can't get away Your heart beats fast, this love will kill Your heart beats fast, this love will kill As deep as you, in deep blue sky As deep as you, in deep blue nights Ride, ride, ride, ride You drift along the desert sun You drift along the desert sun As deep as you in deeper nights You drift along with desert eyes Ride, ride, ride, ride Ha-ah Ha-ahI haven't slept awhile now Tired of always feeling down Thinking of nothing but your face Close my eyes to feel Breathe in and breathe it out Find a reason to shout Watch a film, it's not the same Close my eyes to feel I can't sleep without you I'm all alone, it seems tonight Strange and such a cruel sight Your voice is all I want to hear Close my eyes to feel I've got to shut you out tonight I've got to leave it all behind Someone take this night away Close my eyes to feel I can't sleep without youSad movies make me cry I don't know why They remind me of you Walking home after dark In the park Reminds me of you Reminds me of you They remind me of you They remind me of you Wish I could rewind And reverse time This movie with you This movie with you This movie with you This movie with youTime stands still Call your name Fall in love But you say Don't you dare fall in love Don't you dare fall in love Say I'm wrong Just to late All I know Time won't wait Don't you dare fall in love Don't you dare fall in love Time stands still Call your name Fall in love But you say Don't you dare fall in love Don't you dare fall in love Over and Over again Over and Over again Over and Over again Over and Over againThe night has suddenly become deep, too Can't hold my breath for long Oh, my, we're beginning to blue, oh Oh, my, we're beginning to blue, oh A wild shake cannot wake us up Do believe that it's done Oh, my, we're beginning to blue, oh Oh, my, we're beginning to blue, oh Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God Oh my GodGot your photograph So faded now Was the last light We were so close then I felt the long day When the streets have much to say When I felt the waves Light poured from your eyes It's all coming back Feels like heaven If I hold it tight I can make it real I felt the long day When the streets have much to say When I felt the waves Light poured from your eyesIn the middle of the night Said she wanted to go In search of a sound She still wanted to know Aah Aah Aah Aah She could hear the drum She could hear the deer In the middle of the night It was all so clear Aah Aah Aah Aah
