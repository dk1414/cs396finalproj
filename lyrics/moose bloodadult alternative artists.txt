I could've changed your mind If only you told me, you told me You said you were fine And we talked about needing time and living alone I never got the chance to say what you meant to me And you know I don't believe But I guess you'll watch over me It's three years on, it's not old news Still coming to terms being without you And I hope you watch over me And the way you died Did it hurt at all To think of you that way Did it hurt at all And the way you died Did it hurt at all To think of you that way, I don't at all And I swear at times I can hear your voice Like in the mornings through the door And I can smell those cigarettes That you used to smoke at the backdoorShe said, “I guess you’ve let me down again I don’t wanna be just friends Don’t wanna sleep in the living room”And she said, “I think it’s all you You haven’t seemed yourself lately Do you remember that ring you gave me  I do”She said, “You’ve been drinking far too much You’ve been drunk every night this week I’m so sick of falling asleep without you”And she said, “Just touch my body And kiss me like you used to”She said, “Boy, I miss you I miss you”I’ve been thinking about you, girl Sweetheart, I owe you the world Even though you get drunk and shout all the way home I’ve been thinking about you, girl Sweetheart, I owe you the world Even though you get drunk and shout all the way home Let me hold your hand We can talk about our favourite bands And how Nevermind still blows me awayPacking up your things again, and I thought we were past this I don't need reminding of something I can't forget I'm real sorry to my mother, 'cause I know how much you loved her This could've been so different, it's just too hard to move on from yet And I'd give up everything for a moment of your time And I'd give up everything No one ever took my eyes off you, girl And I wish that you could stay I guess I'm always waiting for you To come back and call my name Like we both still felt the same I'm miserable, and I don't want you to know I've still got your picture in my wallet I want you to know I've still got it I can't seem to take it out as much as I want to lose it now I miss hearing you talk in your sleep The sight of blood, it makes you weak And the way you look at me over your phone And your scent all through my homeRemember when you said you’d stay But you left in January Then you came home in May Did you come back for me I wish I could start over Be the boy she didn’t know But I guess she’ll always be the girl that I take home Remember when you met my dad In our old home And the first night we spent together I couldn’t be alone I wish that I could go back there So you could get to know All the things I used to love before I left home It takes me back to growing up Those better days The first girl that I kissed And all those childish ways We talked for months I tried my luck You finally gave in And girl, you know just how to fuck It takes me back to growing up Those better days The first girl that I kissed And all those childish ways We talked for months I tried my luck You finally gave in And girl, you know just how to fuckSo you’ve got your friends around And you know he’s gotta go Have you heard from your sister Have you heard from your dad Give up on your mother She says, "I already have So long ago, so long ago"So pour me another It’s time to go I’m sick of talking of her It’s getting old If we’re being honest now Don’t tell me that I’m everything you wanted Why you gotta go Why you gotta go and say that You know I never wanted you to say it I got everything I wanted Why you gotta go Why you gotta go and say that It doesn’t matter it was years ago It’s not like we’re nineteen years old She doesn’t get it, she don’t live alone She’s got his traits but they’re not her not her ownBack and forth, I've been here before The words you said just left me on the floor And I came 'round and blew smoke from my mouth I thought I saw you in the clouds But I chose to forgive, I find it hard to forget Even though you said it's something you'd regret It's in the back of my mind But it's worse when I sleep Now I'm losing my breath And I'll never understand how you could forget me This feeling will only get better I'll just hold it all together'Cause we are good for each other And this will pass like the weather Maybe we both know it doesn't work I don't know what to do without making it worse But I don't like who I am when I'm not with you I couldn't make sense of it, I hadn't slept for days I never had the feeling that could make me throw up in the street
