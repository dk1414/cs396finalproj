Don’t let me stand here open up the door, the show wasn’t good enough so I came over I know you don’t feel too good right now, have you heard the news the storm is getting closer You wouldn’t believe who I met before, the Major of the B QE was trying to sell me the Town Hall Return to life, are you that tall Can you see me standing here, out of your door*When no hears you, when the morning just began When no one can see you, you sing it at the sun Your hands against the window, so many things undone Just to think about it you forget it again While I’m still here waiting at the other end I lost connection, or is it you embracing this closure In the dressing room the actor is thinking, what if I make it clear and let them know that is over I’m thinking of a good friend and all his drawings fade into one, here at the second floor*When no hears you, when the morning just began…Take me away, directionless It doesn't have to make any sense Use what you have, I'll follow you Use what you have, don't you worry now Drifting in and out Drifting in and out Choose what to be, take a side What if I don't want to step out in the light Give it to others, just let it go now Give it to others, don't you worry now Drifting in and out...Drifting in and out Drifting in and out Drifting in and out Use what you have Drifting in and out Drifting in and out Drifting in and out Drifting in and outThat’s all I need, to sit in the sun There’s something here, that makes me run It’s all in my head, or is it you instead We are not enemies, but we don’t have to get along And I don’t want to listen, unless you speak from your heart Unless you speak from your heart…You can be weak, without provoking strength And I don’t want to be here, when you will face yourself We are not enemies but we don’t have to get along And I don’t want to listen, unless you speak from your heart Unless you speak from your heart…If I think about it Just don't get me started The way you begin it Decides the way that you own it If I could take off this mask Will you laugh at me  Will you laugh at me Think of the ocean and all the lands Rise above now, all these conclusions here don't make sense Are you going insane See all the places that felt like home, rise above now It's an illusion, is it all in my brain Am I going insane Stop to complain and turn your head around Restrain yourself and then you die Did you tell your friends how much you missed em all How great is to live in a brand new world!And its hard tonight for me to talk Anyway it's too late, the party is over, and I really need to go Chorus:Would you do something for me Do something for me Would you put me to sleep Put me to sleep This headache I have is riding a all over my brain Didn't find my shoes and the night is about to end And I think I lost the boys again I need you now i hope you Chorus: Would you do something for me Do something for me Would you put me to sleep Put me to sleep OhStop to complain and turn your head around Restrain yourself and then you die Did you tell your friends how much you miss them all And how great is to live in a brand new world And it’s hard tonight for me to talk Anyway it’s too late, the party is over and I really need to go Would you do something for me, do something for me Would you put me to sleep, put me to sleep…This headache I have is writing a book all over my brain I didn’t find my shoes and the night is about to end And I think I’ve lost my voice again I need you now, I hope you understand Would you do something for me, do something for me Would you put me to sleep, put me to sleep…Concentrate, just repeat your name Certain words can help not to feel anything What you are leaving was meant to be left Put your toes in the cold water Is it too deep for you Why don’t you just jump in Disappear and never come back Analyzing thunders while they strike on you won’t help Is it too deep for you Is it too deep for you Is it too deep for you In a strange kind of way, lifeless landscapes have so much to say And its hard to sleep tonight, in my head buildings are collapsing Ive never seen the desert before, to be close to nothing Shapeless and gone So good to know you are out there, so good to know you still care And the light seems more bright, even the air feels like the first time And i feel shapeless and goneso close to nothing Shapeless and gone Ive never seen the desert before, to be so close to nothingTell me if it’s true…Just tell me if it’s true This is the end of silence Where everything begins Tell me if it’s true…Just tell me if it’s true One day we’ll disappear With all the pain and grace we have known Fever in my eyes There’s fever in my eyes What the ocean said to you Something clever or something true…Or something that looks like you The end of silence…If you have a wish Say it now Say it now
