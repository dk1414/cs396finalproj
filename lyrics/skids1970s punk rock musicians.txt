his brain was a plastic box His work rate improved 'cause he couldn't stop He couldn't eat lunch with those metal hands His legs were supports for new inner glands Next when I saw him his face was gone A stainless steel spine now instead of bone His arms became grafted onto the switch Six months without food made it quite a trip His wife soon returned from her open grief She told his employer
