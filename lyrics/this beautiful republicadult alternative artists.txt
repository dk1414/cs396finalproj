I was fallen from the first I am not a stranger to the darkness Walked the road of prodigals And crawled upon my knees to You From the ashes and the dirt You fashion beauty from the wounds I've carried Nothing lost, and all redeemed in You Beautifully broken in Your eyes You see the man my sins disguise You took my place You saved my life Miraculous love, sweet sacrifice Beautifully broken You were beautifully broken So You see me as Your own Holy in the light of Your redemption By the blood and by the thorn We're called to lifeI have had enough Buying ashes with my love I don't need this I don't need this I'm pursuing counterfeit I'm worth so much more than this I don't need it I don't need it My flag is turning white I need Your hope tonight For the first time  Surrender saved my life When will this all end Must I open up again I don't need this I don't need this Healing hurts a little more But I'll be stronger than before Yeah, I need this I know I need thisDoubt has never proven anything And redemption will never come if the question lives Hesitation will keep you away Hesitation will keep you away I am finally free from the burden that was slowly drowning me How long until you reach the hand that rescued me You're going under You're going under There's uncertainty with every choice But faith and fear are mutually exclusive His assurance will bring out confidence And that confidence will bring you home I am finally free from the burden that was slowly drowning me How long until you reach the hand that rescued me You're going under You're going under I am finally free from the burden that was slowly drowning me Break free, look up, reach out, hold on tightCan you forget all the lies you're told Will you let go of all the things you hold They can cost you more than you could know But what will you do when everything's gone I saw you under the stars And I caught you wanting them all Desire can change who you are You're so much better off When nothing weighs you down Breaking down, you're starting to see The world's worth nothing when you were meant for Me So cast off those stars they only fall for Me I am still here when everything's gone I saw you under the stars And I caught you wanting them all Desire can change who you are You're so much better off When nothing weighs you downLove, should it be so tragic Should it be dramatic Should it take such a toll on you Trust, why is our trust faded Jesus says to trade them Trade our scars for His promises So give Him all your love this time And give Him everything you are this time You've never been so lucky To have a friend like Jesus Wait, how long will you wait here Your life longs for a new year Your healing must begin somewhere So give Him all your love this time And give Him everything you are this time You've never been so lucky To have a friend like JesusMy heart is tired Of feeling suffering My mind keeps wondering Who I should be Oh, oh, so alone Oh, oh, so alone With no one here for me I feel so dead You whispered in the dark, and you said, you said No, No, never alone No, No, never alone No, No, never alone No, No, never alone I've been thinking about The paths my life has gone down I've pushed a crown of thorns in my brow To show my salvation worked out With all the knowledge I had learned Anchored to righteousness I'd earned And now I've gone the other way Depending too heavily on grace I need a reprieve A point between extremes I need a reprieve A point between extremesSometimes it's hard to see You But I see Your people Sometimes it's hard to hear You But I heard Your preachers My proof is in the way The way that they shine That's how I know that The sun is coming down I get the feeling that I'm not home yet Yeah, it's Your people They're Jesus to the world When it was hard to see You They gave me another chance, like You When it was hard to hear You I could hear them speak Your words My proof is in the way The way that they shine That's how I know thatMy God, oh, my God I'm losing contact Forgetting what is real Able to touch, but not able to feel It's easier, to shut out everyone I'm chasing after my newest distraction to escape it all My God, oh, my God – what have I become The self-addicted one My God, oh, my God – You never failed me You're what I need So often, I'm the sleeping prayer More often, I'm the weeping betrayer Sometimes I play the martyr, become the traitor The humbled sinner, has never been a role I knew to play My God, oh, my God – what have I become The self-addicted one My God, oh, my God – You never failed me You're what I needWaves crashing over Think I'm going under Will the Savior keep me above the surface Someone in the distance Please call me from this Only You can keep me above the surface Thinking that it all just might fade away I'm terrified to fall 'cause I stepped out today Sinking 'cause I know, I know I think too much Save me, please save me My eyes are keeping Focused only on You It's You that keeps me above the surface I just can't stop Thinking that it all just might fade away I'm terrified to fall 'cause I stepped out today Sinking 'cause I know, I know I think too much Save me, please save meI've heard it said a million times That I should hold on tight to Jesus But I took this road so far from home And distance came between us When I walked away, I knew one day I'd need Your grace So now You'll find me on my knees Surrendering‘Cause I know that I'm really not so strong And now, I'm done fighting for control Oh, You can have this life That I've been holding for so long I'm learning to fall Let my world crumble You ran so fast to rescue me While I was barely breathing You picked me up, You touched my face And I began to see more clearly
