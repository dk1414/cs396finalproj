Das Fenster öffnet sich nicht mehr Hier drin' ist es voll von dir - und leer Und vor mir geht die letzte Kerze aus Ich warte schon 'ne Ewigkeit Endlich ist es jetzt so weit Da draußen zieh'n die schwarzen Wolken auf Ich muss durch den Monsun Hinter die Welt Ans Ende der Zeit Bis kein Regen mehr fällt Gegen den Sturm Am Abgrund entlang Und wenn ich nicht mehr kann, denk' ich daran:Irgendwann laufen wir zusamm'n Durch den Monsun Dann wird alles gut'n halber Mond versinkt vor mir War der eben noch bei dir Und hält er wirklich was er mir verspricht Ich weiß, dass ich dich finden kann Hör' deinen Namen im Orkan Ich glaub' noch mehr dran glauben kann ich nichtI'm staring at a broken door There's nothing left here anymore My room is cold It's making me insane I've been waiting here so long But now the moment seems to have come I see the dark clouds coming up again Running through the monsoon Beyond the world To the end of time Where the rain won't hurt Fighting the storm Into the blue And when I lose myself I think of you Together we'll be running somewhere new Through the monsoon Just me and you A half-moon’s fading from my sight I see your vision in its light But now it's gone and left me so alone I know I have to find you now Can hear your name, I don't know how Why can't we make this darkness feel like home It's raining today The blinds are shut, it's always the same I tried all the games that they play But they made me insane Life on T VIt's random, it means nothing to me I'm writing down what I cannot see Wanna wake up in a dream Whoa, whoa They're telling me it's beautiful I believe them, but will I ever know The world behind my wall Whoa, whoa The sun will shine like never before One day, I will be ready to go See the world behind my wall Trains in the sky Are travelling through fragments of time They're taking me to parts of my mind That no one can find I'm ready to fall I'm ready to crawl on my knees to know it all I'm ready to heal I'm ready to feelIt's been a while since i've seen your face I wonder how you look today, old friend Remember when you knew my name Before the world got in our way I won't forget But I wanna be connected The way we were before You said we'd stay the same That we wouldn't change at all Our hearts were unprotected We were never scared to fall You said you won't forget me Guess time has changed in all When life was easy And we smoked weed in the backseat of your car And watched the stars When love came easy I gave you all a boy could give Life was wild and dangerous But I knowDu stehst auf und kriegst gesagt wohin du gehen sollst Wenn du da bist, hörst du auch noch was du denken sollst Danke, das war mal wieder echt'n geiler Tag Du sagst nichts und keiner fragt dich: sag mal willst du das Nein -
