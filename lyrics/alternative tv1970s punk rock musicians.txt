your radio oh oh Johnny come home early from work that evening, about half-past five He opened the door slowly and run into the flat expecting to find Julie there He ran upstairs and say "hi Julie I'm home", but she wasn't anywhere to be seen He looked everywhere but he coudln't find her She went out somewhere So he sat down in front of the T V to wait for his dearest Julie He switched on the T V and got into some, uh, light entertainment It was so strange she wasn't home It was so strange she wasn't home And then whilst sitting there by the T V set he saw this, uh, envelope lying on the coffee table"That's weird"He picked it up and opened it It said "To Johnny: "I'm afraid, this is Julie speaking, I'm fed up with all your chores, I'm fed up with washing your clothes, I'm fed up with waiting hand on foot on you, so I've finally decided to leave you, so that's it Johnny, that's the end of our relationship, I've finally decided to walk out on you and I'm going out with David now, I hope it's not too much of a shock"Johnny just couldn't believe it, Julie had gone and left him He just fell back into the armchair, stunned Oh, man, he was so knocked out, he just couldn't believe it Julie had gone on an left him, what was he gonna do He stumbled around for a while, trying to come to his senses because Julie had left him Just trying...And then the phone, the phone began to ring He picked it up I can't speak to anyone, man, get off the end of the line I can't speak to This is a real dilemma, this is a real dilemma I gotta find, I gotta find Get off the end of the line He put the receiver back where it belongs, and he settled down in the armchair again Slightly shaking from the upheavel So he went for the helpline on the radio That'll pull him out of it He'll find some, uh, he'll find some help He must find some help So he went to the radio And all he could get was this noiseRestaurant Vibing up the senile man of a hundred years We had it in our pockets and now it's on the streets Accusing the answer phones, and the back-stabbing lies Ask for the waiter Move for the girl Ask for the chef"I didn't ask for grilled waiter, which is not my kind of dish"But it's sweet Understanding questions, set the record straight, we've found your truth Hiding in a phone box on the M1 We're on our way to a club in some sordid big city They're waiting Watching every move Asking for the words of wisdom from the prophets Disappointed Disjointed Ask for action Move in your own time Smash the television Questions, answers, ideas, critics, sounds We're on a bad trip and they're on a good one But who are we to tell you what to do and you what to say Disappointed and disjointed An important decision takes place every time A mother buys a piece of meat Part of a missionary who lived a wonderful life Helping people Giving them his faith, and showing them his good book And good looks, and good words, and good hymns, and good walk, and good signs, and good food, and good fights, good life And he died a great death But the people were still disappointed And disjointed Disappointed And disjointedI kissed her on the station Clutching the crucifix She'd handed me We finally parted We wanted each other But she was tied up I'm facing up to the facts I'm facing up to the facts I kissed her on the station Clutching the crucifix She'd handed me We finally parted We wanted each other But she was tied up I'm facing up to the facts I'm facing up to the facts I'm facing up to the factsEnding of the hunting party Shifting blame to factory Asking for pennies Riceballs for the refugees Innocence, innocence Crawling on your hands for mercy, as the cannibal lifts his axe As the cannibal lifts his axe Feeding the millions Buying second hand clothes Down and out The secrets have all been found out Around about the centre of Africa lies an ancient stone The spirits will kill And we  the pharaohs The spirits will kill Ten  dropping in on our fat feast The spirits will kill So release the natives, release the natives, release the nativesA chance to see the other me is coming soon on the next full moon Why did, why did it happen  Maybe the masters lied I kiss with my lips your fingertips, a word comes out you scream and shout:"Cut out, cut out her tongue, to stop my endless words"I burn the book before they took me to the room, the interview room No choice, no choice but to nod, I write cat, cat on the pad My dada voice that had no choice but to put me in a cage I walked to the wall, turned 'round, walked back, sit down  as I look into the mirror and understand my dream
