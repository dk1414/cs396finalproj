you, that don't sound like love Sounds like it sucks He can't even bait a hook He can't even skin a buck He don't know who Jack Daniels is He ain't ever drove a truck Knows how to throw out a line But not the kind in a field and stream book No darlin' I ain't even worried, youll come runnin back He can't even bait a hook Has he kissed you in a hay field as the summer rain falls down Has he took you to meet his mama, back in his home town Does he drive the interstate, or does he take them old back roads Can he melt your heart with a country song, every good old boy should know I didn't think so He can't even bait a hook He can't even skin a buck He don't know who Jack Daniels is He ain't ever drove a truck Knows how to throw out a line But not the kind in a field and stream book No darlin' I ain't even worried, youll come runnin back He can't even bait a hookTour was up middle of June She was plannin' a welcome home barbecue Green bean casserole, grandma's recipe There was a knock on the door around two o'clock Two uniforms and her heart stopped Yellow ribbon 'round an oak tree, blowin' in the breeze Here's to the ones that didn't make it back home The ones we ain't seen in so long The hold up a beer ones The wish they were here ones The not forgotten but gone In a better place up there But they sure left a hole down here We just go on livin' and go on missin'The ones, the ones that didn't make it back home The whole town shut down, the whole town showed up Sang Amazing Grace, watched a slide show of His 22 years, there was laughs and there was tears And that preacher talked about sacrifice And traffic stopped for them Cadillac lights Johnny sold beer half priced that night And everybody raised 'em high singin'I could tell by the way you sounded when you called That I

Sawmill Road He'd be there peeling peaches If it was twenty years ago And what I wouldn't give To ride around in that old truck with him If heaven wasn't so far away I'd pack up the kids and go for the day Introduce 'em to their grandpa Watch 'em laugh at the way he talks I'd find my long lost cousin John The one we left back in Vietnam Show him a picture of his daughter now She's a doctor and he'd be proud Tell him we'd be back in a couple of days In the rear view mirror, we'd all watch 'em wave Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take If heaven wasn't so far awayTonka trucks and
