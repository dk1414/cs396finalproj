Let my inspiration flow In token rhyme suggesting rhythm That will not forsake me'Til my tale is told and done While the firelight's aglow Strange shadows from the flames will grow'Til things we've never seen Will seem familiar Shadows of a sailor forming Winds both foul and fair all swarm Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady Many years ago Here beside him stands a man A soldier from the looks of him Who came through many fights But lost at love While the storyteller speaks A door within the fire creaks Suddenly flies open And a girl is standing thereTruckin', got my chips cashed in Keep truckin', like the do-dah man Together, more or less in line Just keep truckin' on Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street Your typical city involved in a typical daydream Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings Dallas, got a soft machine;Houston, too close to New Orleans;New York's got the ways and means But just won't let you be, oh no Most of the cats that you meet on the streets speak of true love Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home One of these days they know they gotta get goin'Out of the door and down to the street all alone Truckin', like the do-dah man Once told me "You've got to play your hand"Sometimes the cards ain't worth a dime If you don't lay'em downIf my words did glow with the gold of sunshine And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung Would you hear my voice come through the music Would you hold it near as it were your own It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken Perhaps they're better left unsung I don't know, don't really care Let there be songs to fill the air Ripple in still water When there is no pebble tossed Nor wind to blow Reach out your hand, if your cup be empty If your cup is full, may it be again Let it be known there is a fountain That was not made by the hands of men There is a road, no simple highway Between the dawn and the dark of night And if you go, no one may follow That path is for your steps aloneAs I was walking round Grosvenor Square Not a chill to the winter But a nip to the air From the other direction She was calling my eye It could be an illusion But I might as well try Might as well try She had rings on her fingers and Bells on her shoes And I knew without asking she was Into the blues She wore scarlet begonias Tucked into her curls I knew right away She was not like other girls Other girls In the thick of the evening When the dealing got rough She was too pat to open And too cool to bluff As I picked up my matches and Was closing the door I had one of those flashes:I'd been there before Been there beforeMust be getting early Clocks are running late Paint by number morning sky looks so phony Dawn is breaking everywhere Light a candle, curse the glare Draw the curtains, I don't care 'cause it's alright I will get by I will get by I will get by I will survive I see you've got your fist out Say your piece and get out Yes, I get the gist of it, but it's alright Sorry that you feel that way The only thing there is to say Every silver lining's got a touch of grey I will get by I will get by I will get by I will surviveI lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds Didn't get to sleep that night 'til the morning came around Set out runnin' but I take my time A friend of the devil is a friend of mine If I get home before daylight Just might get some sleep tonight Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills Spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills Set out runnin' but I take my time A friend of the devil is a friend of mine If I get home before daylight Just might get some sleep tonight I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there He took my twenty dollar bill and he vanished in the air Set out runnin' but I take my time A friend of the devil is a friend of mine If I get home before daylight Just might get some sleep tonightWell, the first days are the hardest days Don't you worry anymore'Cause when life looks like Easy Street There is danger at your door Think this through with me Let me know your mind Woah, oh, what I want to know Is are you kind It's a buck dancer's choice my friend Better take my advice You know all the rules by now And the fire from the ice Will you come with me Won't you come with me Woah, oh, what I want to know Will you come with me Goddamn, well, I declare Have you seen the like Their walls are built of cannon balls Their motto is don't tread on me Come hear Uncle John's Band Playing to the tide Come with me or go alone He's come to take his children homeI told Althea I was feeling lost Lacking in some direction Althea told me upon scrutiny That my back might need protection I told Althea that treachery Was tearing me limb from limb Althea told me: "Now cool down boy Settle back, easy Jim"You may be Saturday's child all grown Moving with a pinch of grace You may be a clown in the burying ground Or just another pretty face You may be the fate of Ophelia Sleeping and perchance to dream Honest to the point of recklessness Self centered to the extreme Ain't nobody messing with you but you Your friends are getting most concerned Loose with the truth Maybe it's your fire But baby, don't get burned When the smoke has cleared, she said That's what she said to me You're going to want a bed to lay your head And a little sympathyDriving that train, high on cocaine Casey Jones you better, watch your speed Trouble ahead, trouble behind And you know that notion just crossed my mind This old engine Makes it on time Leaves Central Station About a quarter to nine Hits river junction At seventeen to At a quarter to ten You know it's traveling again Driving that train, high on cocaine Casey Jones you better watch your speed Trouble ahead, trouble behind And you know that notion just crossed my mind Trouble ahead A lady in red Take my advice You'd be better off dead Switch-man sleeping Train hundred and two Is on the wrong track And headed for youLook out of any window Any morning, any evening, any day Maybe the sun is shining Birds are winging or rain is falling from a heavy sky What do you want me to do To do for you to see you through For this is all a dream we dreamed One afternoon, long ago Walk out of any doorway Feel your way, feel your way like the day before Maybe you'll find direction Around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you What do you want me to do To watch for you while you are sleeping Then please don't be surprised When you find me dreaming, too
