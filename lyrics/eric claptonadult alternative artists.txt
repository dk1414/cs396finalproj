Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven I must be strong and carry on‘Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven I'll find my way through night and day‘Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees Time can break your heart, have you begging please Begging please Beyond the door, there's peace, I'm sure And I know there'll be no more tears in heavenIf you wanna hang out You've got to take her out Cocaine If you wanna get down Down on the ground Cocaine She don't lie She don't lie She don't lie Cocaine If you've got bad news You wanna kick them blues Cocaine When your day is done And you wanna run Cocaine She don't lie She don't lie She don't lie CocaineIt's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to wear She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair And then she asks me, "Do I look all right "And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"We go to a party and everyone turns to see This beautiful lady that's walking around with me And then she asks me "Do you feel all right "And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"I feel wonderful because I see The love light in your eyes And the wonder of it all Is that you just don't realize how much I love you It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed And then I tell her, as I turn out the light I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight"See if you can spot this one What will you do when you get lonely No one waiting by your side You've been running, hiding much too long You know it's just your foolish pride Layla, got me on my knees Layla, begging, darling, please Layla Darling, won't you ease my worried mind Tried to give you consolation Your old man had let you down Like a fool, I fell in love with you You turned my whole world upside down Layla, got me on my knees Layla, I'm begging, darling, please Layla Darling, won't you ease my worried mind Make the best of the situation Before I finally go insane Please don’t say we'll never find a way Tell me all my love's in vainIf I could reach the stars Pull one down for you Shine it on my heart So you could see the truth That this love I have inside Is everything it seems But for now I find It's only in my dreams And I can change the world I will be the sunlight in your universe You would think my love was really something good Baby if I could change the world If I could be king Even for a day I'd take you as my queen I'd have it no other way And our love would rule In this kingdom we have made'Til then I'd be a fool Wishing for the dayI shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy All around in my home town They're trying to track me down They say they want to bring me in guilty For the killing of a deputy For the life of a deputy But I say I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense I shot the sheriff, and they say it is a capital offense Sheriff John Brown always hated me For what I don't know Every time that I plant a seed He said, "Kill it before it grows"He said, "Kill it before it grows"I saySailing down behind the sun Waiting for my prince to come Praying for the healing rain To restore my soul again Just a toerag on the run How did I get here What have I done When will all my hopes arise How will I know him When I look in my father's eyes My father's eyes When I look in my father's eyes My father's eyes Then the light begins to shine And I hear those ancient lullabies And as I watch this seedling grow Feel my heart start to overflowThere is nothing that is wrong In wanting you to stay here with me I know you've got somewhere to go But won't you make yourself at home and stay with me And don't you ever leave Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms Don't you think you want someone to talk to Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon I've been trying all night long just to talk to you Sun ain't nearly on the rise We still got the moon and stars above Underneath the velvet skies, love is all that matters Won't you stay with me Don't you ever leave Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms Don't you think you want someone to talk to Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon I've been trying all night long just to talk to youI don't care if you never come home I don't mind if you just keep on Rowing away on a distant sea Because I don't love you and you don't love me You cause a commotion when you come to town You give them a smile and they melt Having lovers and friends is all good and fine But I don't like yours and you don't like mine La la, la la la la la La la, la la la la la I don't care what you do at night Oh, and I don't care how you get your delights I will leave you alone, I will just let it be I don't love you and you don't love me I got a problem  Can you relate I got a woman calling love hate We made a vow we'd always be friends How could we know that promises end Come down off your throne and leave your body alone Somebody must change You are the reason I've been waiting so long Somebody holds the key But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home Come down on your own and leave your body alone Somebody must change You are the reason I've been waiting all these years Somebody holds the key But I can't find my way home But I can't find my way home But I can't find my way home But I can't find my way home Still I can't find my way home And I ain't done nothing wrong But I can't find my way home
