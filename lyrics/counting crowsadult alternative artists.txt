Sha, la, la, la, la, la ,la Mmm Uh huh I was down at the New Amsterdam Staring at this yellow-haired girl Mr  Jones strikes up a conversation With a black-haired flamenco dancer You know, she dances while his father plays guitar She's suddenly beautiful We all want something beautiful Man, I wish I was beautiful So come dance this silence down through the morning Sha, la, la, la, la, la ,la, la, yeah Uh huh, yeah Cut up, Maria!Show me some of that Spanish dancin'Pass me a bottle, Mr  Jones Believe in me Help me believe in anything'Cause I wanna be someone who believes YeahSo, she said, "What's the problem, baby "What's the problem  I don't know Well, maybe I'm in love Think about it Every time I think about it Can't stop thinking 'bout it How much longer will it take to cure this Just to cure it, 'cause I can't ignore it if it's love Makes me wanna turn around and face me But I don't know nothin' 'bout love, uh Come on, come on Turn a little faster Come on, come on The world will follow after Come on, come on Because everybody's after love So I said, I'm a snowball runnin'Runnin' down into the spring that's comin'All this love meltin' under blue skies Belting out sunlight, shimmering love Well, baby, I surrender To this strawberry ice cream Never-ever-ender All this love Well, I didn't mean to do it But there's no escaping your love, ohStep out the front door like a ghost into a fog Where no one notices the contrast of white on white In between the moon and you, the angels get a better view Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right Well, I walk in the air between the rain Through myself and back again Where  I don't know Maria says she's dying Through the door, I hear her crying Why  I don't know'Round here, we always stand up straight'Round here, something radiates Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis And she walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus She parks her car outside of my house and takes her clothes off Says she's close to understanding Jesus And she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood She has trouble acting normal when she's nervousA long December and there's reason to believe Maybe this year will be better than the last I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leaving Now the days go by so fast And it's one more day up in the canyons And it's one more night in Hollywood If you think that I could be forgiven I wish you would The smell of hospitals in winter And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls All at once, you look across a crowded room To see the way that light attaches to a girl And it's one more day up in the canyons And it's one more night in Hollywood If you think you might come to California I think you should Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after 2 A.M And talked a little while about the year I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower Makes you talk a little lower About the things you could not show herThey paved paradise and put up a parking lot With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot Don't it always seem to go That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone They paved paradise and put up a parking lot Ooooh, bop bop bop Ooooh, bop bop bop They took all the trees, and put them in a tree museum And they charged the people a dollar and a half to see them No, no, no Don't it always seem to go That you don't know what you got 'till it's gone They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot Ooooh, bop bop bop Ooooh, bop bop bopMy friend assures me, "It's all or nothing"I am not worried, I am not overly concerned My friend implores me, "For one time only Make an exception" I am not worried Wrap her up in a package of lies Send her off to a coconut island I am not worried I am not overly concerned With the status of my emotions Oh, she says, "You're changing"But we're always changing It does not bother me to say This isn't love'Cause if you don't wanna talk about it Then it isn't love And I guess, I'm gonna have to live with that But I'm sure there's something in a shade of gray Or something in between And I can always change my name If that's what you mean My friend assures me, "It's all or nothing"But I am not really worried I am not overly concernedI am colorblind Coffee black and egg white Pull me out from inside I am ready, I am ready, I am ready I am taffy stuck and tongue tied Stutter-shook and uptight Pull me out from inside I am ready I am ready I am ready I am fine I am covered in skin No one gets to come in Pull me out from inside I am folded and unfolded and unfolding I am colorblind Coffee black and egg white Pull me out from inside I am ready I am ready I am ready I am fine I am fine I am fineWhen I think of Heaven, deliver me in a black-winged bird I think of flying down in your sea of pens and feathers And all other instruments of faith and sex and God In the belly of a black-winged bird Don't try to feed me'Cause I've been here before And I deserve a little more And I belong in the service of the queen And I belong anywhere but in between She's been crying and I've been thinking And I am the rain king And I said, "Mama, mama, mama, why am I so alone"'Cause I can't go outside, I'm scared I might not make it home Well I'm alive, I'm alive, but I'm sinking in If there's anyone at home at your place, darling Why don't you invite me in Don't try to feed me'Cause I've been here before And I deserve a little moreSomebody screamed and all of Jim Jeffries dreams Explode against a black fist He falls to the floor He stares up at the sky and he may wish he knew why But he can’t go back there no more The future sounds so crazy We all heard that song before Tomorrow's the name we changed from yesterday to blame When the train just don't stop here anymore I got starry-eyed on the coaster ride Andy said, "Man, I need a break from the world outside These days, my life just careens through a pinball machine I could do so much better, but I can't get off the T IL T"There’s a photograph on the T VBlack and white and —Andy says something to you —Jack Johnson straddling Reno, Nevada like —She says “I forget myself sometimes too”Out past the doorways where we are sleeping The White Queens creep and the tomcats peep And now I’m not breaking The train’s just shaking I never made it here before There's a Wild Mouse spinning the girls around Til they can't take it anymore I used to dream in the dark of Palisades Park Up over the cliffs and down among the sparks It’s a long life full of long nights But it’s not what I was waiting for Everybody's seen the horses diving down the shore It's a miracle they don't make them anymoreStart tearing the old man down Run past the heather and down to the old road Start turning the grain into the ground Roll a new leaf over In the middle of the night There's an old man treading around in the gathered rain Hey, mister, if you're gonna walk on water Could you drop a line my way Omaha, somewhere in middle America Get right to the heart of matters It's the heart that matters more I think you'd better turn your ticket in And get your money back at the door Start threading the needle Brush past the shuttle that slides through the cold room Start turning the wool across the wire Roll the new life over In the middle of the night There's an old man threading his toes Through a bucket of rain Hey, mister, you don't wanna walk on water'Cause you're only gonna walk all over me
