O K, it's alright with me Some things are just meant to be It never comes easily And when it does, I'm already gone I'm practically never still More likely to move until I end up alone at will My life continues inching along When Bernadette comes, I get lost on her time She's much too sweet, and she's always gonna be And when I return to her arms and her eyes It might not be the same, but it's alright with me OK, it's alright with me Some people are scared to see What's happening frequently But I would never shy from a fight Heartbeat with a high demand Often will go hand in hand But I'm sick of just starting plans I wanna spend the rest of my lifeRight about the time I missed your call I lost my mind the drugs wore off It's raining where I am I hope you see the text I sent and don't go soft Cause I can't stand to be alone When the buzz starts wearing off Can I get a little more Can I get a little more From you-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh From you-oo-oo-oo-oh-whoa Can I get a little more Can I get a little more from you That's me sitting in the bathroom with the lights off Nobody knows the kind of stuff I gotta to fight off I wash away my sins but I can't get the white off What made you think that you could ever take the night off I can't stand to be alone When the buzz starts wearing offHe's been waiting around for the weekend Figuring which club to sneak in Fancy drinks and fifty-dollar cover charge Lately it's been a big hassle Heineken and New Castle To make sure he's fitting in and living large Disregard the lies that he will tell And what he's probably like 'cause It's not hard his charm is gonna Get him through the night If he wants to rock he rocks If he wants to roll he rolls He can roll with the punches Long as he feels like he's in control If he wants to stay he stays If he wants to go he goes He doesn't care how he gets there Long as he gets somewhere he knows oh no Ah na na na na na na na na na na na Ah na na na na na na na na na na na See her heavy make up and cut t-shirt Every girl out wants to be her But they look the same already why adjust Reading the magazine secrets Forgetting the topical regrets'Cause If she comes home all alone the night's a bust It's a must the swivel in her hips And the look she gives It's all her trust if only in the morning She knew where she livedLet's tell the world all the things we've done Falling in love in the setting sun I got a song and a smile so bright I'll make you wish you were here tonight All of the places we ever go Feel familiar, I'm never alone All of the people that I don't know Will be looking me up when they all get home Let's tell the world all the things we've done Falling in love and the setting sun I've got a song and a smile so bright I'll make you wish you were here tonight And if you tell the world your secrets You never know What's set in stone And what can grow Tell the world Tell the world I'm gonna tell the world Tell the world Tell the world That I got something on my mindDear me, you’ll be older one day I’m writing from the future and you’re doing ok Dear me, hold on to what you’ve got Things are gonna change, but change is better than you thought Dear me, I know you’re scared as hell of everything right now But don’t get lost in where you’re going Dear me, you’re gonna fall in love with the girl that you live next door to And you have no real way of knowing Don’t know who you are, don’t know who you are, don’t know who you are, but I know you’re trying Don’t know who you are, don’t know who you are, don’t know who you are, but you’re multiplying Dear me, you’ll be older one day I’m writing from the future and you’re doing ok Dear me, hold on to what you’ve got Things are gonna change, but change is better than you thought I said, you’re gonna get yourself, get yourself, get yourself together You're gonna you’re gonna get yourself, get yourself, get yourself together Dear me, don’t keep people in your life that treat you like crap And don’t lose sleep over 'em either Dear me, never give up on the good that rests inside of you And don’t believe the non-believersAnd now I'm trying to decide If I feel dirty at all Cause it gets hard to tell It's never just black and white She's got a mind of her own and she uses it well So she invites me over outside Villanova She's got some pull-out sofa that we won't hardly need She is only drinking soda, revving up that motor Got places we could go to, but I still won't believe That she's only gifted When I'm standing by her side She goes unassisted And I start to relax as I cut her some slack CH OR US So get up, I gotta go to work Facing all these people who now know I'm a jerk And it's a set-up, I gotta change my clothes Concealing all this evidence before everybody knows What I've done and what I'm gonna do again And in the middle of the night I have a breakdown of sorts with regret creeping in She's gonna put up a fight And she will get her way, cause she loves sleeping in So I need someone to side with when she begins confiding And I cannot provide it cause I'm endlessly cold She says she's so excited to play some groom and bride With me but I'm undecided so I need to be toldI love you From the bottom of my heart And that's not gonna change, but things look grim When I am watching you watch him I give you The best a man can hope to give But I'm not feeling brave, chances are slim When I am watching you watch him CH OR US Oh, what is left to learn When he would let you crash and burn He never gives attention but you still yearn Where do I fit in When I am watching you watch him God only knows why I still wait around Except I hate to see you cry And I need you But there are things I cannot do I want you When he's playing all his games And it gets hard to tell who's the victim When I am watching you watch himC HO RU SGood rhythm, really don't care I can take the elevator, you can take the stairs Good rhythm, killin' my time A little bit of luxury, I really don't mind God, just give me a chance God, just give me a chance God, just give me a chance Or get off the floor if you're not gonna dance That's me, the heir apparent Dancin' ninjas in Paris Talk shit and hurt my larynx I still live with my parents Wake up, I'm so delighted Play Xbox, all new white kids Black out and dream white lightning'Cause I really don't care I'm not like those other rich kids you might know That's the reason I don't get in trouble I need some good rhythm, really don't care I can take the elevator, you can take the stairs Good rhythm, killin' my time A little bit of luxury, I really don't mind Baby, give me a chance Baby, give me a chance Baby, give me a chance Or get off the floor if you're not gonna danceCall me crazy if you've got it in you But these people don't seem to mind Sweet vermouth now you're telling me the truth A little stubbornness will work out fine A bottom feeder at the end of my rope But I'm wondering where this rope began Gonna circle around what I couldn't help bring down It's just supply with demand Nothing looks the same Even when there's been no change Say that something's gonna give And it's all giving out on you When it's all over now It's all over now It's no longer fun and it's all been overdone So it's all over now A large pickup truck with a little cargo towed Gets from baker's to the laundromat These daily fights all start to sound alike I guess I'm gonna have to live with that Short changed Now it's getting even harder to identify the repetition Short changed Now it's getting even harder to identify the repetition Will I simply peel away Feels more likely everyday Say that something's gonna give And it's all giving out on youDon't let this affect the game every five months we act the same But I never get used to putting you off And no one could've scripted this who knows what'll come of it I refuse to believe it was all just a waste Cause look around Everybody's on the food chain Funny but from day to day we get from bottom to top And if you get lost you start over again But we don't ever get to no we don't ever get to stop I wake up in the oblivious state go to sleep trying to save some face Cause I've never been one for acting naïve And so what we've got nothing to prove Why on earth would we soften the mood Do we think that this wire is better left live Cause look around Everybody's on the food chain Funny but from day to day we get from bottom to top And if you get lost you start over again But we don't ever get to no we don't ever get to stop I would've known better if I was on the outside I would've known better if I was on the outside Looking in, looking in But this chain just eats away at the people who use it No one's gonna say that it's easier losing Touch with who we need When it's lonlier on the outside
