I could be in love if you wore that dress every day With your hair just so and your eyes of grey You'd make a beautiful bird on a line A beautiful bride of Frankenstein A beautiful drop of iodine If you were mine, if you were mine, if you were mine I could be in love if the sun came out every day Set the sky on fire and the city grey I'd be there at the drop of a dime If you were mine, if you were mine, if you were mine If you were mine, I'd tear the altar down Of all that I'd lost to romance If you were mine, I'd risk my dignity If only to give love a chance If you were mine, I'd have the world I'd have the world if you were mine And I could be in love if the sirens sang every day You draw me closer to destiny Give us this moment to shine Me and my bride of Frankenstein A beautiful bird on a line If you were mine, if you were mine, if you were mine Would you be mine  Would you be mine I'm being tailed I'm being marked I'm being asked if I know where you are Joni is scared I haven't slept I'm playing it cool But I know what you did And all the time you thought I would break Well maybe I am 'cause I'm not hiding from main streets no more If you're coming for me we'll see who is the matador You talk about blood like it's binding us If you're coming for mine All bets are off You pose as a king with a city to rule But you were never a lion You were always a bull I have a deal I think you should take I'll forget it all if you go away And stay awaySome men fall for love of money Some men fall to sex Some men make false religion Comfort and protection Some men they'd die for duty Die for family But I'd rather drink the power And call it loyalty I like the way it makes me feel I'm free I like the way it makes me feel I like the way it makes me feel I'm free I'm free yeah There's nicer homes to live in Safer streets to roam But when you climb the ladder There's nothing you can own This ghetto's my cathedral This gun my eucharist I take the offering And I decide what sin isEverybody wanna change the world But nobody ever changed this town Tell yourself you're gonna rise above it Until the blacktop pulls you down We got blue veins til they hit the knife And we don't change who we are We got blue veins til they hit the knife And they bleed red, bleed red Why can't I be more I don't wanna fight my Father's wars Nothing comes easy where I come from So we sweat it out in the concrete sun Til the colors run I've seen the story play out before Old men, they just fade away And we become what our fathers were Like soldiers following the orders Put it on the shoulders of the family name It's who we areMaybe God is a rich man Who saved up his money and moved out the city Then settled in the suburbs And built up his fences to protect his possessions And nobody sees him But the church spreads rumors that he's coming back again But if God is a rich man, why am I so poor If I forsake my family If I forsake my blood Tell me, what's in it for me What's in it for me If I forsake my demons If I forsake my love Tell me, what's in it for me What's in it for me Maybe God is a hard man Who can show you mercy but it won't come free And he offers protection If you stay on the take and you take what he needs And nobody sees him But they pray wholehearted when they need forgiven But if God is a hard man, why am I still alive Maybe you'll see me on the evening news Maybe you'll see me with a bag over my head If that's the case, then I've met my doom If that's the case, then my comrades are dead And I don't hate my enemy I hate the cloud he's brought over my land There's no virtue in killing a man Neither is there virtue in being afraid to stand But I saw the black coats forming lines They hit our beaches running We're on our knees but not to pray You're the only reason I stay In this coward's melee I'd rather die than live without mercy and love Sing while the city decays We'd rather go up in flames Lest we betray the names of dignity and love You can't change the course, our fate's sealed long ago But hope is not lost Code name Corbeau We trade their secrets at cost for our lives The panzer is strong, the raven is wise I tune my ears to the B BC I can hear them, they can't hear me I long to forget all the horrors I've seen I live like a ghost I'll die with the freeGunshots fired in an alleyway Gunshots fired in the street A son of God lies with the wicked A wicked man stands at his feet That's how the colors run That's how they run That's how the colors run Watch 'em run Gunshots fired in an alleyway Gunshots fired in the street Teardrops fall for the righteous Raindrops fall for the thief That's how the colors run That's how they run That's how the colors run Watch 'em run Gunshots fired in an alleyway Gunshots fired in the street Colors run deep in the city Like the color of blood On the concreteIt was a numinous night, wet and cold like the last week of autumn I felt a shiver dividing my bones from the top to the bottom And there were two of me then, one part flesh and the other a phantom To the phantom I said, get behind me, ye vamp of Diablo It said, you speak out of turn, I am born of the shadow inside you And I have lived in your heart and with it I've become quite accustomed Choose your blade, we shall dance in the blood and the rain I grow sick of your whispered betrayals Go where the dead go, tu estas muerto Choose your blade, I won't be held as a prisoner of shame I grow sick of your lies and your games Get thee behind me, you shall not bind me It was a coward's decision when I offered you sanctuary I knew it, right then and there that our cartel would be my undoing But I, rationalized and believed every mangled half truth Choose your blade, we shall dance in the blood and the rain I grow sick of your whispered betrayals Go where the dead go, tu estas muerto Choose your blade, I won't be held as a prisoner of shame I grow sick of your lies and your games Get thee behind me, you shall not bind meOo oo little red With your heart in Stalingrad Oh, it kills me how they hate you But they just don't understand Oh oh-oh red When they put me on the stand I will testify I loved you And I'm not ashamed to be your comrade Red, red, baby's a red She's blood red Baby's a red The feds said"Lock her in lead She's red," but I love her Oo oo little red It's not like Mc Carthy said Although we differ on religion We both support the working man Oh oh-oh red, if the bombs fall on our lands Then our politics won't matter Only that I loved you until deathLemme crash right here tonight Lemme lay low here till the heat goes by Don't you want me here tonight Don't you wanna help me Lemme sober up here tonight In the morning we'll head for the northern line Don't you want a fresh start tonight Don't you want me baby It isn't love you'll find When you run and hide And that's why I can't let you stay tonight You know I heard about your other man My punk cousin with the silver spoon in his hand You know if it was any other man I'd fill his lungs with concrete I'm gonna burn it all down tonight Last chance if you wanna be by my side I'm gonna finish it off tonight I want you standing with me The love you're for is a settled score And that's why I can't love you anymore The love you're for is a settled score And that's why I don't love you anymore
