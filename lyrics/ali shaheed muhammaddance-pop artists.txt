Yo, Sway, man  I can't even describe it, man The situation was crazy, bruh If I was a gorilla, I would say it was bananas, B For real, the man just- he just took over the whole situation, god Listen Man, it is what it is Can't understand a man if you ain't lived what he lived Roaches in the crib, ain't got no food up in the fridge Plus the crime running rampant and it's screwing up the kids Sway, admit, what kind of paradise is this I just want my 40 acres and some carats on the wrist But these snakes is trying to gather in the pit When you get a cottonmouth, plucking ashes off the clip Off the rip, now a challenger exists And he bulletproof, shoot, what kind of caliber is this Got thugs in the store with the barrel on your lips Saying, "empty out the drawer" before he pound you with the grip Lord, who to call when no one obeys the law And there ain't no Iron Man that can come and save us all Power to the people and Luke Cage the cause And the cops got it wrong, we don't think Cage involved Look, dog, a hero, never had one Already took Malcolm and Martin, this is the last one I beg your pardon, somebody pulling a fast one Now we got a hero for hire and he a black one And bullet-hole hoodies is the fashion We in Harlem's Paradise, tell the Captain That I'm about to trade the mic for a Magnum Give up my life for Trayvon to have oneThis is what you get when you ____ around with a vet Take this as a threat and I’m far from finished yet I bust my sound, it pounds, another crown laid down So crossfade now, this is just a mic check Thumping on your set screaming hands on deck I haven’t bust a sweat or a tear  Fella, what you fear Your balling is done, it’s endgame There’s only one that reigns supreme to the team Here to crush your petty scheme With a stream of gasoline, set fire to your gangster-lean And screams for holy water, coming up to steam You know what I mean  You been saying things out of order Should have thought of the backlash and the whiplash And the war brought to your ass x2 This is what you started, you schemed it, you plotted You dreamed it, you charged it, elevated orange Finish what you started, you reaped it in secret You’re dearly departed, elevated orange Them laws you make It’s not going to keep you safe You straight transgressed the means, now it’s time for you to come clean When I mix it up, it’s going to leave your face twisted up This chick’s just a lame duck and nay mutt hush Just sit, dog, sit  Rabid dog on that This is a big boy spit, got you aimed in my pad And I’m aiming to drag this critic to the limit, with my b-boy spirit You feel it, fans hear and they chill with admiration for this Brooklyn-born sensation, busting up your party and your safe haven Said I was finished, you was greatly
