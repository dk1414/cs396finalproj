In South Carolina there are many tall pines I remember the oak tree that we used to climb But now when I'm lonesome, I always pretend That I'm getting the feel of hickory wind I started out younger at most everything All the riches and pleasures, what else could life bring But it makes me feel better each time it begins Callin' me home, hickory wind It's a hard way to find out that trouble is real In a far away city, with a far away feel But it makes me feel better each time it begins Callin' me home, hickory wind Keeps callin' me home, hickory windWon't you scratch my itch sweet Annie Rich And welcome me back to town Come out on your porch or  step into your parlour And I'll tell you how it all went down Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels And a good saloon in every single town And I remembered something you once told me And I'll be damned if it did not come true Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down And they all led me straight back home to you Cause I headed West to grow up with the country Across those prairies with the waves of grain And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue sea And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee We flew straight across that river bridge, last night half past two The switch-man wave his lantern goodbye and good day as we went roling through Billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel And now I know just what I have to do And the man on the radio won't leave me alone He wants to take my money for something that I've never been shown And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue see And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to TennesseeShe She came from the land of the cotton A land that was nearly forgotten by everyone She She worked and she slaved so hard A big old field was her back yard in the delta sun Oh, but she sure could sing Oh, she sure could sing Then he Looked down and he took a little pity The whole town swore he decided he'd help her some But he Didn't mind if she wasn't very pretty And deep inside his heart, he knew she was the only one Oh, but she sure could sing Yeah, she sure could sing She had faith, she had believing She led all the people together in singing And she prays every night to the Lord up above Singing hallelujah, hallelujahIn my hour of darkness In my time of need Oh, Lord grant me vision Oh, Lord grant me speed Once I knew a young man Went driving through the night Miles and miles without a word With just his high-beam lights Who'd have ever though they'd build such A deadly Denver bend To be so strong, to take as long as It would till the end In my hour of darkness In my time of need Oh, Lord grant me vision Oh, Lord grant me speed Another young man safely strummed his Silver string guitar And he played to people everywhere Some say he was a star But he was just a country boy His simple songs confess And the music he had in him So very few possessLove hurts, love scars Love wounds and mars Any heart not tough Nor strong enough To take a lot of pain Take a lot of pain Love is like a cloud Holds a lot of rain Love hurts Mmm-mm, love hurts I'm young, I know But even so I know a thing or two I've learned from you I've really learned a lot Really learned a lot Love is like a stove Burns you when it's hot Love hurts Mmm-mm, love hurts Some fools think of happiness Blissfulness, togetherness Some fools fool themselves, I guess But they're not fooling meWe know it's wrong to let this fire burn between us We've got to stop this wild desire in you and in me So we'll let the flame burn once again until the thrill is gone Then we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning We're two people caught up in the flame that has to die out soon I didn't mean to start this fire and neither did you So tonight when you hold me tight we'll let the fire burn on And we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning Each time when we meet we both agree that it's for the last time But out of your arms I'm out of my mind So we'll taste the thrill of stolen love tonight until the dawning And we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning We're two people caught up in the flame that has to die out soon I didn't mean to start this fire and neither did you So tonight when you hold me tight we'll let the fire burn on And we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning Yes we'll taste the thrill of stolen love tonight until the dawning And we'll sweep out the ashes We'll sweep out the ashes We'll sweep out the ashes in the morning Copyright 1969 Sawgrass Music Pub., Inc  B MIOh, my land is like a wild goose Wanders all around, everywhere Trembles and it shakes 'til every tree is loose It rolls the meadows, and it rolls the nails So take me down to your dance floor And I won't mind people when they stare Paint a different color on your front door And tomorrow, we will still be there Jesus built a ship to sing a song to It sails the river, and it sails the tide Some of my friends don't know who they belong to Some can't get a single thing to work inside So take me down to your dance floor And I won't mind the people when they stare Paint a different color on your front door And tomorrow, we will still be thereWell I sold the farm to take my woman where she used to be We left our kin and all our friends back there in Tennessee And I bought those one way tickets she had often begged me for And they took us to the streets of Baltimore Well her heart was filled with gladness when she saw those city lights She said the prettiest place on earth was Baltimore at night Well a man feels proud to give his woman what she's longing for And I kinda liked the streets of Baltimore Hen I got myself a factory job, I ran an old machine And I bought a little cottage in a neighborhood serene And every night when I'd come home with every muscle sore She'd drag me through the streets of Baltimore Well I did my best to bring her back to what she used to be Then I soon learned she loved those bright lights more than she loved me Now I'm a going back on that same train that brought me here before While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore While my baby walks the streets of BaltimoreHearts on fire My love for you brought only misery Hearts on fire Put out the flames and set this cold heart free One short year our love had burned Until at last I guess you learned The art of being untrue and then goodbye What could I do except to cry and moan Lord, what have I done Once we were as sweet and warm As the golden morning sun Hearts on fire My love for you brought only misery Hearts on fire Put out the flames and set this cold heart free Bridge Friends say it's just a game And that no one is to blame Go out forget her lies But she'll be there and sparks will fly My love has turned to hatred Sleep escapes me still God, please take this heart of mine'cause if you don't the devil willOoh, Las Vegas, ain't no place for a poor boy like me Ooh, Las Vegas, ain't no place for a poor boy like me Every time I hit your crystal city You know you're gonna make a wreck out of me Well, the first time I lose I drink whiskey Second time I lose I drink gin Third time I lose I drink anything'Cause I think I'm gonna win Ooh, Las Vegas, ain't no place for a poor boy like me, no Ooh, Las Vegas, ain't no place for a poor boy like me Every time I hit your crystal city You know you're gonna make a wreck out of me Well, the queen of spades is a friend of mine The queen of hearts is a bitch Someday when I clean up my mind I'll find out which is which Ooh, Las Vegas, ain't no place for a poor boy like me Ooh, Las Vegas, ain't no place for a poor boy like me Every time I hit your crystal city You know you're gonna make a wreck out of me
