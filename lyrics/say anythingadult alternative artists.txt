And if I could swim I'd swim out to you in the ocean Swim out to where you were floating In the dark And if was blessed I walk on the water you're breathing To lend you some air for that heaving Sunken chest'Cuz they chose you As the model For their empty little dreams With your new head And your legs spread Like a filthy magazine And they hunt you And they gut you And you give in And if I was brave I'd climb up to you on the mountain They led you to drink from their fountain Spouting lies And I'd slay The horrible beast they commissioned To steer me away from my mission To your eyesWhen I watch you, wanna do you Right where you're standing Right on the foyer, on this dark day Right in plain view Of the whole ghetto The boots stomp meadows But we ignore that You're lovely, baby This war is crazy I won't let you down Oh, no, no No I won't let them take you, won't let them take you Hell no, no, oh no I won't let them take you, won't let them take you Hell no, no No Oh, no no no!And when our city, vast and shitty Falls to the axis They'll search the buildings, collect gold fillings Wallets and rings But Ms  Black Eyeliner You'd look finer with each day in hiding Beneath the wormwood Oooh, love me so good They won't hear us screw away the day I'll make you sayAdmit it!Despite your pseudo-bohemian appearance And vaguely leftist doctrine of beliefs You know nothing about art or sex That you couldn’t read in any trendy New York underground fashion magazine Prototypical non-conformist You are a vacuous soldier of the thrift store Gestapo You adhere to a set of standards and tastes That appear to be determined by an unseen panel of hipster judges Giving a thumbs up or thumbs down to incoming and outgoing trends and styles of music and art Go analog baby, you’re so post-modern You’re diving face forward into a antiquated past It’s disgusting, it's offensive, don’t stick your nose up at me Yeah, what do you have to say for yourself Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah Yeah, what do you have to say for yourself Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah You spend your time sitting in circles with your friends Pontificating to each other Forever competing for that one moment of self-aggrandizing glory In which you hog the intellectual spotlight Holding dominion over the entire shallow pointless conversation Oh, we’re not worthy When you walk by a group of quote-unquote normal people You chuckle to yourself patting yourself on the back as you scoff It's the same superiority complex Shared by the high school jocks who made your life a living hell And makes you a slave to the competitive capitalist dogma You spend every moment of your waking life bitching aboutHere I am Laid bare At the end of my rope I've lost all hope So long Molly Connolly just broke up with me Over the revealing nature of the songs You goddamn kids Had best be gracious with The merch money you spend'Cause, for you I won't ever have rough sex With Molly Connolly again Here I am Laid down At the end of my rope Wishing I had not been born Now I've spewed too much I can never shut it up I thought you should be warnedI want to know your plans and how involved in them I am When I go to sleep for good will I be forgiven And If you want roses you can go buy a bouquet If that just won't cut it, well what can I say You're what keeps me believing the world's not gone dead Strength in my bones put the words in my head When they pour out to paper, it's all for you Cause that's what you do  That's what you do I want to know your fear, from your feet to the back of your ears When they raise the landing gear will your heart stay here If you could forgive me for being so brash, well you You could hit me or whip me, I'd savor each lash You're what keeps me believing the world's not gone dead Strength in my bones put the words in my head When they pour out to paper, it's all for you Cause that's what you do No more fighting This is only a waste of our time Cause soon we'll be leaving Will this strength still be mine I'll look out for you 'til I die, 'til I rot I'll remember you 'til I die, until I rotAll the words in my mouth That the scene deemed unworthy of letting out Banded together to form a makeshift militia And burrowed bloodily through my tongue and my teeth And I stood proud in the gallery With my open socket of a mouth for them to see They all just laughed and said "That boy, he That boy's got woe, whoa He lives with woe, whoa"And this girl who I met Whose pride makes her hard to forget She took pity on me horizontally But most likely because of my band And that's all I can get when I'm lonely And these visions of death seem to own me In the quiet of the classrooms All across the stacked United States of Woe, whoa We live with woe, oh, oh, oh, oh She said"I can't get laid in this town Without these pointy fucking shoes My feet are so black and blue And so are you"I watch my yellow cat Invade my red cat in the yard The feline war has raged for years So I assume it'd be too hard For me to drive my foot between them I would never risk the scratch Just to prove to one or both of them A cat is just a cat Again I watch my cousin Greg Watch M TV inside his home He makes fun of the hip hop videos From the couch he rides alone Snug in the cushion of his cackling He forgets his living doubt He has relied on this for years You will not yank the carpet out No, no These are my friends This is who they have been For always These are my days This is how they stay Hey, hey Hey, heyI believe in God but I've no reason to follow Lost my virginity to myself I'm just sparks and meat I believe in love but I'm gassy, dank and hollow I'd rather drink, smoke, die young, be reborn and repeat I belong in jail but I lied my way to heaven With a wife who hasn't learned that I'm Satan yet I want to burn my art so I can carve one twee and modern But I'll just serenade the chemicals It's the cure that's hardly medical666, I need a fix Never better, I'm a little bit sick I hold a grudge and a burden I hold a tongue and an organ Bang, bang, bang, I hit and ran And left my inner child dead in the drain I hold the fire and the hunger I hold the name and the number, 666 Unimpressed by the symmetry of death Drown in butter 'til there's no hope left It's alright  You think I'm worthy of your wandering eye I'm just a strung out, overweight Jewish guy It's alright  It's alright So Lord, help me  So Lord, help meI have to record the spoken-word introduction to the record Still Yeah  It's only a few lines, but I'm having anxiety about it Do you know what it is Yeah, it goes—Good, so you don't have to write it It goes—Oh, yeah, let me hear it It goes, "And the record begins, with a song of rebellion."And if I could swim I'd swim out to you in the ocean Swim out to where you were floating In the dark And if was blessed I walk on the water you're breathing To lend you some air for that heaving Sunken chest'Cuz they chose you As the model For
