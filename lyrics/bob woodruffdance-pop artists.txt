instead of feeling sad I can get you through if you were my woman If I were your man tonight I’d kiss you and hold you tight We may discover something new In both of each other Oh that’s what I’d do If you were my woman If I were your man i’d be loving you If you were my woman I would be so glad I can make it through If you were my woman If I were your man that’s right We wouldn’t be lonely tonight Or running for cover when it storms We’d hold one another Oh that’s what I’d do If you were my woman And if I were your man I’d be loving you If you were my woman I would be so glad I could make it through If you were my woman Mmm  mmm mmm mmm mmmIf you know she’s the one who loves you You don’t need to ask her why If you know she’s  been thinking of you You don’t need to know what’s on a woman’s mind She will always be the sweetest mystery You know it’s you that she loves Oh she does yeah she does If you knew what made her heart sings You’d sing a melody each day Before you try to pull her heart strings You better learn the song she longs to hear you  play She will always be the sweetest mystery You know it’s you that she loves Oh she does yeah she does You know the morning sun would always rise Just like the sweetest mystery in your eyes How they shine the sails on a crystal  sea Greener waves just splashed our sandy feet White was suggest you wore our wedding day And pink a rose in the bride’s bouquet But these shades for once look bolder Now we’re fade in so much color Alone and i’m sinking down The skies are grey without you So I paint the town blue my mistress of the Like you she’s out of reach far from my love of her eyes fell from the skies alone I fell into this garden made of stone Then you love once much stronger Now we’re fade in so much color Alone and i’m sinking down The skies are grey without you So I paint the town blueHow could I have know the reason I was chose to fix the problem I never knew I have In a million years I could never dream that I be here I had no clue that was a moment That I realize magic moment Hit me right between the eyes And no one never told me why Nobody sees the aim of my life When I feel like a moving target So hard to know Where to hold on And when to let go With all the things that stand in the way All the things I have And all the plans I made Now I’m depending that they have changed It’s easy to try hard It’s hard to just try easy And just let things flow With where they go There is still a moment To close your eyes Don’t quit the moment When life becomes a bumpy ride Before it has had a chance to slide That nobody see’s the aim of my life When happy to see my life as a moving targetThere is a cold and wild wind Blowing down these streets again Where we both once walked arm and arm Wish I could see her smile again Her smile promised everything I wish she didn't need to break my heart I cried so many tear drops Till everyday they come Still I miss her more I go outside to walk for more The other people in the sun But in the after movie show Sitting alone there in the dark No one can see the teardrops start No one can see me lose my self control I cried so many tear drops Till everyday they come Still I miss her one I cried so many tear drops Till everyday they come And still I miss her one I wonder if she’ll ever cry Tears for me in time She’ll be sad she let me go But there must be someone out there In the night somebody new to hold me tight Someone true to walk with down the roadWhat is heaven do you know Is it a place where only the Angels go I hope that this isn’t true What does heaven means to you If I had strong in telescope Will I see something to give me hope Cause I lost sight of what my dreams were worth And I missed the heaven here on earth Sometimes life it isn’t fair to so many reasons to despair It would be easier to bear there’s a better world somewhere Why is heaven out of sight Can we get there at the speed of light With every clock ticking in reverse As we shoot across the universe Sometimes life it isn’t fair to so many reasons to despair It would be easier to bear there’s a better world somewhere Somewhere over the plain so far from the fear And wash back the restI read the writing on the wall How could it be beautiful you leave But I know I’m heading full force I see the way you look at me You could never keep any secrets Your eyes could never hide the truth You said it all girl without speaking The secret out I’m losing you You try to keep it to yourself But I unwound the mistry You gotta put me on a shelf Like summer put up history He could never keep any secret Your eyes could never hide the truth You said it all girl without speaking The secrets out I’m loving you Girl what can I do to get you back Don’t leave me here with lonely memory Oh memoryBaby, baby, I’m aware of where you go Each time you leave my door I’m watchin’ you walkin’ down the street Knowing your other love you’ll meet But this time, before you run to her Leavin’ me alone and hurtin’Think it over after I’ve been good to you Think it over after I’ve been sweet to you Stop in the name of love before you break my heart Stop in the name of love before you, before you break my heart Think it over Think it over I’ve known of your secluded nights And I’ve even seen her maybe once or twice But is her sweet expression worth more Than my love and affection But this time, before you leave my arms And rush off to her charms Think it over, haven’t I been good to you Think it over, haven’t I been so sweet to you Stop in the name of love before you break my heart Stop in the name of love before you, before you break my heart Think it over Think it over Oh, II should leave you well enough alone Why did I fall so far from home You gave me somethin’ that I lack It’s just the feelin’ I got back So hold on to me We’re both a little scared We can’t deny there’s somethin’ there Time will tell if what we’ve got is strong‘Cause I know only love can wait this long I long to be with you again I’m only dreamin’ up ‘til death So hold on to me We’re both a little scared We can’t deny there’s somethin’ there I hope tonight I’ll dream about you So you won’t seem so far away Far away I want to be with you again I will be dreamin’ until then
