I wake up in the morning Sky is gray and storming Buildings bridges and city streets Still as ugly as yesterday They used to tell me Anything just to sell me But I learn quick when I have to I wanna say it to ya I wanna say it I wanna say Stay in the light Keep your target in sight Don't listen to Fools on the run Stay in the light Keep your target in sight Don't listen to Fools on the run I can look up to you I can look right through you I see just what I wanna see Things are easier that way I stand alone But I still need a home I'm just playin' along in this Waiting game The waiting game The waiting gameHot summer night Storm clouds in the air My eyes' lids so heavy I'm feeling in the past tense I'm hardly aware I don't want you on the phone Don't you play good girl with me Why must I always say it again I've got a new girl now I've got a new girl now I've got a new girl now And she's a lot like you I tried to wash my face But my head fell too low I tried to bear with myself But my mind wouldn't stay at home I don't care if you're sitting at home Somebody has broken into me Why must I always say it again I got a new girl now I got a new girl now I got a new girl now And she's a lot like youIf you would just be sensible You'd find me indispensable I pray deep down to destiny That it places you with me Whoa, wanting you here in the sheets Wandering around incomplete Waiting so long To feel it again I thought that this heart would never mend To feel it again, I know it is the living end To feel it again I thought that this heart would never mend To feel it again, I know it is the living end Another scratched or scribbled note To handsome men in overcoat Deception right in front of me A jealous fantasy Whoa, something that sets you apart Tightens your grip on my heart Don't ever let it go Till I feel it again I thought that this heart would never mend To feel it again, I know it is the living end To feel it again I thought that this heart would never mend To feel it again, I know it is the living endWhat did I say to ya, what did ya see me do That made ya turn to stone overnight I thought I played it right Lovin' you deep in the night The chain of love is broken now Why can't we start again Cause my heart won't mend But you say no, then you go, and I break down I'm still a lonely man burning in love I'm still a lonely man burning in love What did he say to ya What did he promise you That made you change from white to black I don't understand it It seems so underhanded I want to hate you but I'm still in love Why can't we start again Cause my heart won't mend But you say no, then you go And I break down I'm still a lonely man burning in love I'm still a lonely man burning in loveThe two of us are one of a kind This combination ain't easy to find But why do I get a feeling from you Things ain't right Do you need something new Knowing how both of us live Leaves us so little to give If I could grow wings I would do anything Just to keep you with me Can't you see If I could fly high I would give you the sky Don't you make that mistake What does it take It's not like I've been mean to you Its not like I've got something better to do The life I live you'll never understand If you fly with me we'd never have to land Its easy to live hard and fast But inside we know it won't last Oh yeahhhhhhhLight in the window light of the day Light of the fire so far away Reachin' out in the darkness No one is there I live with doubt I live with pain I live with silence nothin' to gain Just these distant memories Faded photographs I've never been this way before Gave up my heart and so much more If we could only just start again but I know You're not comin' back So here I am Lyin' here missin' you Wherever you are I'll still be lovin' you I tried to run I tried to hide I tried to forget keep it all inside Went the distance but I'm Right back where I started Now in the silence of an empty room Somehow hopin' you'll come back soon I want to hold you just one more time but I know You're not comin' backI wake up in the morning Sky is gray and storming Buildings bridges and city streets Still as ugly as yesterday They used to tell me Anything just to sell me But I learn quick when I have to I wanna say it to ya I wanna say it I wanna say Stay in the light Keep your target in sight Don't listen to Fools on the run Stay in
