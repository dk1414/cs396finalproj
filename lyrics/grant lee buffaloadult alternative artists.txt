Bring me home To this house of, many days Just lay me on the floor Hard and cool as slate You know I love it more and more Than before I ran away It triggers off so many hurts Hurtful words and broken plates I've been lied to Now I'm Fuzzy I've been lied to All and all The world is small enough for both of us To meet upon the interstate Waiting on a train And just when those big arms lift up Fall in love with no time to say itDevastation at last, finally we meet After all of these years out here in the street I had a feeling you would make yourself known You came along just to claim your place on the throne Now I have been overthrown, overthrown And I thought if I toed the right lines But these mockingbirds won't let me shine Devastation, my door was left open wide You brought me into your heart and you swallowed my pride I had a feeling you were hiding your thoughts I made a note to myself, I nearly forgot Now I'm overwrought, I'm overwrought And I thought if I toed the right lines But these mockingbirds won't let me shine And I thought if I toed the right lines But these mockingbirds won't let me shine One day this ground will break and open up for me I hope it will, I hope it will Salutations at last, I'm down on my knees I heard the bugle this morning blast Reveille Woke from a dream where I was in a terrible realm All my sails were ablaze, I was chained to the helm Now I'm overwhelmed, overwhelmedThere's a bullet in the heart tonight In the heart of Texas Shout it to the Dallasites We are rolling home They shot an angel in mid-flight And now she won't protect us Shout it to the bedlamites We are westward ho Pray the holy war is ending Like in the films of Hollywood And the angels are descending Like Koresh had said They would before too long Sing a Lone Star Song They had him nailed up to a T With a T for Texas His disciples with artillery They held the fort inside And by the time the story broke Down at Dealey Plaza We've already caught the smoke Read the T V guide Pray the holy war is ending Like the films of Hollywood And the choppers are descending Like Ma  Reno said They would before too long Sing a Lone Star SongNever mind me 'cause I've been dead Out of my body, been out of my head Never mind the songs they hum Don't wanna sing along with nothin' that I said They don't bring you happiness Happiness is hard to come by I confess I'm bad at this thing, happiness If you find it, share it with the rest of us Never mind the words that came Out of my mouth when all that I could feel was pain The difference in the two of us Comes down to the way you rise over things I just put down And I don't bring you happiness Happiness is hard to come by I confess I'm bad at this thing, happiness If you find it, share it with the rest of us The rest of us Never mind me 'cause I've been dead Out of my body, been out of my head Never mind the curse of war Proud like a badge that just don't shine no moreIt's the luck of the draw How you wound up with me I don't know how at all But I beg you to stay Crawl around on this earth While the world's still small Honey, don't think About it too long now Honey, don't think You're liable to figure me out Something wrong in my stars Could you look at my chart And help me heal these scars Could you learn to read minds In the case of mine Do you read in the dark Honey, don't think About it too long now Honey, don't think You're liable to figure me out You don't want to figure me out You don't want to figure me outSteel mill streets overrun The ghost of cars in the yard Sunflower speaks of a one Of a one Engines purr up above The L train roars like our love Like our love I can hide in you In your chestnut hair I'll confide in you Whisper in your ear When the earth is ripe All the worms wake up In their stars and stripes And their swastikas There's a cure in sight Set your soul at ease For the red and white And the blue disease La, shoo-be-do-la Do-be-do-be-la-la Dee-dee-dee-dee-la Dee-dee-dee-dee-la Dee-dee-dee-dee-la Do-be-do-be-laJust a girl who can't say no And her sweetheart on parole Parents named her Jupiter To bless her with a lucky soul He's a boy who never cried When they locked him up inside And she nicknamed him her teardrop For the tattoo by his eye Now she's sleeping in her bed And he's sleeping in her bed And it's Jupiter and Teardrop And it's Jupiter and Teardrop She divines by radio Pushing buttons show to show And she wonders 'bout the fate of Lovers in the barrioIf the life you have created Has buried you with luxuries out-dated And you ask what is the purpose Too weak to claw your way up to the surface You resent all of your trophies They belittle human spirit like a timepiece That is ticking in your breast pocket And so you long to reach in and stop it Then your heart it will be broken And every sour word that you have spoken About everybody else Will return to act upon yourself If the life you have created Is founded on jealousy and hatred It's too late to ask questions For you're much too old to take any suggestions It's the life you have created It's the life you have created It's the life It is the life It is the life It is the life It's the life you have created It is the life you have created It is the life It is the life It is the life It is the life It is the lifeI'm in tight with a demon called Deception It's alright he's a-treatin' me quite well I'm in tight with a demon called Deception He's right beside me when I fail To whisper words like "Brother, nothin' here is any good See the birds they're a-droppin' like the star Wormwood"And all I wanted was a little patch of green We were peasants and the cotton was our king And in the fields how I sing a prisoner's song While Deception whistles right along Right along Charlie sang for a pocket full of pills While Deception was a-clickin' his high heels We're in tight playing seven one night stands And Deception made me as I am As I am As I am As I am As I am I'm in tight I'm in tight I'm in tightI was hangin' with some friends In the parking lot one night near the summer's end I leaned back against the glass Of a car to watch all those speeding comets crash It made me think about us Made me think about us Truly, truly, truly I want you Truly, truly, truly I do Truly, truly, truly I want you You were lying by the pool And the surface of the water was a lapis jewel I dove in to make a splash Woke ya from your dream Nodding off out on the grass It made me think about us Truly, truly, truly I want you Truly, truly, truly I do Truly, truly, truly I want you Truly, truly, truly I want you Truly, truly, truly I do Truly, truly, truly I want you It's just been too long That we set aside some time alone I sure could use your point of view And it's been awhile since We dropped our guard and cracked a smile Don't you think it's overdue Well how 'bout you
