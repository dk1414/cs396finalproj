Word up What happened in the car, yo F'real, let a nigga—Brand new truck, butter soft seats Four-point-something with a low ridin' something Ain't nothing better than to ride out the hood with it Who

when the evening is over, love Gonna find a nice spot for the Rover, love Do things to make the man in the moon blush My mind race, but I tell my waist don't rush You's a upper echelon piece So when

it all, it's you It's you, it's you At the end of it all its you It's you, it's you At the end of it all Looking, from how I see it When I finally realized, couldn't believe it I couldn't even swallow Had a lump in my throat, my stomach hollow I had a notion that things were fishy But everything was fine, so why be pissy But when you wasn't seeing me nights, you'd get it in That's when the snooping and shit, it would begin"Where you at  Where you goin'?"That's what I get when I pick up the phone Not a "Hello" or a "I miss you"Or, "The Renaissance, how does it do "Suspicious ones, though few, can stress out your brain It weighs on you, man, and helps you peep game I thought it was me, but then, I could see it was you Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, get up Uh-uh, for real, uh-uh Come on Ummah, Ummah, Ummah, Ummah A hard time if your motion is still Let me move some things around because the lyrics is ill Abstract..you know my stiggidy in here Niggas get on and swear it's they fuckin' year But yo your girl just moved To the joint in the club, in the car if it groove Broad look, the movement is on Mild mannered mami's in Victoria thongs, uh I get my rhyme on thus Guaranteed to make it right if your night is a bust You Vivrant and you fresh and all Original to say the least and you've impressed Kamaal Rappers start then they stall Findin' it very hard to make it over the wall Hey, get your weight up, my motto you heard And I grown a deaf ear to felonious words, uh So girls move it around If you see your main dog give a brother a pound And just uh. ]I don't care who first or who last I just know y'all betta rock dis at da drop of a dime, baby  I don't care what y'all say or what y'all do But you got to be finished before the music is through I don't think they heard me, hold up…So here we go, now It be the Midnight Maurader on the scene Geographically earthed in a place called Queens I was formed with my principles, way I displayed When I used to cool out where all the other kids played‘Cause I was way too ill, I would hone my skill Go out in the park and let my chemicals spill Right there, on Farmers Boulevard, I made my mark Two dudes, brothers would dip from us, me, and N AR CS And then my legend would grow on the A-train line Where rappers would gather to see me blowin' nicks and dimes It was me, Big Pete, Tanya, and Sir Ibu When in the heat of the cypher, I was not liable For all the casualties of the dutty M Cs I split the train car like Moses did the Red Sea Get it in your head, we gon' rock the dead Night of the living M C's, the weak ones fled; c'mon Bus…Gettin' up Come on, we gettin' up Come on, we gettin' up Ugh, yeah Ugh Sent you a message, sent you a email Hasty decisions we made still prevail Both needed breaks, we both needed to bail Walking through the corridors of my mind The hideaways and nooks and things with good times Memories, certainly, yes, they still bind Still a common man, and yeah, that's for sure Still a bankroll, and yeah, still couture But, man, this thing we had was much more Come back home, don't be out in the world It's a rat race and no place for a girl Amongst the scavengers, I found a pretty pearl It's for the faint of heart who never get enough Gotta get tough, buckle em up, we call 'em duds And we, and we, and we, ahhh  We got the gettin up, we got the gettin up Today is nice, come on, ayo, we gon' gettin up Said we gettin up, said we gettin up Tonight is right, come on, we gon' gettin up I said we gettin up, I said we gettin up, come onSometimes, I phase out when I look at the screen And I think about my chance for me to intervene And it's up to me to bring back the hope Put feeling in the music that you could quote Not saying that I hate it, 'cause, yeah, I kinda dig it But what good is a ear if a Q-Tip isn't in it So just stick it in, and inform your friend Your boy from the hood is on that shit again He's upped the degrees and dropped the mercuries To splash on the mass from low- to upper-class And when the records spins, it sometimes blows a wind A fickleness of friends, they sometimes hate again They always bring up Tribe, I mean, can I survive  I mean This is my mans, I mean, this is my fams And here's somethin' new, it's front-row for you So don't misconstrue, it's Tribal and true My dudes who hustle hard, don't stop your repertoire As long as you could see, it's you who's stayin' free'Cause life is filled with pills and little pearls and shit I'm fuckin' up—I mean, I'm trippin' up But still, there is a void, and people get annoyed Let's focus is on the feel, before we get a deal—come on Figurin' life can be a thing The wilderness is wild to me But you're not alone, I see we're just the same Figuring out where we should be Figurin' life can be a thing The wilderness is wild to me But you're not alone, I see we're just the same And it, and it begins, he walks outside for a cigarette break And thinks "How many cigarettes does it take "He takes a long drag with the sun in his eye He squints, he thinks he starts to sigh Sometimes he cry When he think about his girlfriend on his side She held him down, she made him better Fucked a thug through fucked up weather And she thinkin' about her life With no more work, just being a wife But instead her love she gave to a man Who fought against her lovely plans So when she go to work, plus go to school Plus fight the love, she must feel like a fool She want the ease that come after pain She fights for love, that's her campaign We fight, we love We fight and love so much Sometimes I get confused of who we are Maybe if we just stop and chat a bit We'll find out who we are We fight and love so much Sometimes I get confused of who we are Maybe if we just stop and chat a bit We'll find out who we are
