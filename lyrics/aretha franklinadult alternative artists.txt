gone Ain't gon' do you wrong 'cause I don't wanna All I'm askin' is for a little respect when you come home Baby When you get home Yeah I'm about to give you all of my money And all I'm askin' in return, honey Is to give me my propers when you get homeThe moment I wake up Before I put on my makeup I say a little And while I'm combing my hair now And wondering what dress to wear now I say a little Forever , and ever You'll stay in my heart and I will love you Forever , and ever We never will part, oh, how I love you Together , together That's how it must be to live without you Would only mean heartbreak for me I run for the bus, dear But while riding I think of us, dear I say a little And at work I just take time And all through my coffee break time I say a little You better think Think about what you're trying to do to me Think Let your mind go, let yourself be free Let's go back, let's go back Let's go way on to way back when I didn't even know you You couldn't have been too much more than ten I ain't no psychiatrist, I ain't no doctor with degrees But it don't take too much high I Q to see what you're doing to me You better think Think about what you're trying to do to me Yeah, think Let your mind go, let yourself be free'Cause freedom Stands for freedom Oh, freedom Yeah, freedom, right now Freedom Oh, freedom Give me some freedom Oh, freedom, oh, right nowLooking out on the morning rain I used to feel so uninspired And when I knew I had to face another day Lord, it made me feel so tired Before the day I met you, life was so unkind But you're the key to my peace of mind'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel You make me feel like a natural woman When my soul was in the lost and found You came along to claim it I didn't know just what was wrong with me'Til your kiss helped me name it Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for And if I make you happy, I don't need to do more'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel You make me feel like a natural woman Chain, chain, chain Chain, chain, chain Chain, chain, chain Chain of fools For five long years I thought you were my man But I found out, love I'm just a link in your chain, oh You got me where you want me I ain't nothing but your fool You treated me mean, oh You treated me cruel Chain, chain, chain Chain of fools Every chain Has got a weak link I might be weak, yeah But I'll give you strength, oh, hey You told me to leave you alone My father said come on home My doctor said take it easy Oh, but your loving is much too strong You're a no good heartbreaker You're a liar and you're a cheat And I don't know why I let you do these things to me My friends keep telling me That you ain't no good But oh, they don't know That I'd leave you if I could I guess I'm uptight And I'm stuck like glue'Cause I ain't never I ain't never, I ain't never, no, no Loved a man, the way that I, I love you Some time ago I thought You had run out of fools But I was so wrong You got one that you'll never lose The way you treat me is a shame How could you hurt me so bad Baby, you know that I'm the best thing That you ever hadAin't no way for me to love you If you won't let me It ain't no way for me to give you all you need If you won't let me give all of me I know that a woman's duty Is to help and love a man And that's the way it was planned Oh, but how can I, how can I, how can I Give you all the things I can If you're tying both of my hands Oh, oh, it ain't no way It ain't no way It just ain't no way, baby Ain't no way, baby It ain't no way for me to love you If you won't let me Stop trying to be someone you're not Hard, cold, and cruel is a man Who paid too much for what he got And if you need me like you say, say that you do Oh, then please, please, please Don't you know that I need you I'm only one step ahead of heartbreak One step ahead of misery One step is all I'd have to take backwards To be the same old fool for you I used to be I'm only one step ahead of your arms One kiss away from your sweet lips I know I can't afford to stop for one moment'Cause I'm just out of reach of your fingertips Your warm breath on my shoulder Keeps reminding me That it's too soon to forget you It's too late to be free, can't you see I'm only one step ahead of your love I try and yet I can't take two Seems like I'll have to take that one step backwards'Cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you'Cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you Just one step ahead is a step too far away from youWhat you want, baby, I got it What you need, do you know I got it All I'm askin' is for a little respect when you come home Hey baby when you get home mister I ain't gonna do you wrong while you're gone Ain't gon' do you wrong 'cause I don't wanna All I'm askin'
