mind Oh-woah I'll go, but I won't go quietly Go down, but I'll go down fighting Don't know where, don't know why But I can't go back, back to the way I was I'll show who I am from the inside Gonna

throneLost and defeated, but still I stand My heart in pieces will beat again There is a story written in the stars That makes it worth it just to bear these scars Left foot forward and then my right It's not over, I've still got fight You get that feeling when you cross that line Like it was worth it just to take what's mine]Brave enough to broken Can't see, but keep going, oh Brave enough to be broken There's no more fear inside]I threw my heart in the fire I've never fallen from higher But I threw my heart in the fire I've never fallen from higher But Jem Ooh, Jem Ooh Jem Whoa, Jem The music's contagious Jem is my name, no one else is the same Jem is my name But we're The Misfits Our songs are bitter We are The Misfits, The Misfits And we're gonna get her Jem The music's contagious Jem is my name, no one else is the same Jem is my name If it Reminds you of something A familiar feeling of wanting An it hits you hard Can you break free To talk about your dreams beside me I want it to last Till it hurts you to Fight it You will lose your way to save me And it could blind you, but find me Sink into a world within and hear me As my Heart Beats Will you Heart Beat Heart Beat Heart Beat How will you behave if I hold you down I wanna understand you try running Through your veins It's too much of a good thing That you know so well What is left to lose We have lived in hell But I have more to give While my hands are burning lightly I am drowning in your fire And through the flames unafraid to melt You are breathing life, Inside meMaybe I'm alone out here and nobody's listening Maybe I'm the only one and my voice is echoing But what if I'm wrong and there's a million others just like me And no, we're not alone, alone We can be alone together And no, we're not alone, alone We can feel alone together And no, we're not alone, alone And no, we're not alone, alone I can see the flashing lights, oh, but can they see me Everybody shines so bright, but I'm in the dark hiding But what if I'm wrong and there's a million others just like me And no, we're not alone, alone We can be alone together And no, we're not alone, alone We can feel alone togetherWell, Tamatoa hasn't always
