back They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see And you won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free You got a new horizon, its ephemeral style A melancholy town where we never smile And all I wanna hear is the message beep My dreams, they've got to kiss me 'cause I don't get to sleep, no Windmill, windmill for the land Turn

we all seem to keep Drive on engines till they weep With future pixels in factories far away So call the mainland from the beach Your heart is now washed up in bleach The waves are rising for this time of year And nobody knows what to do with the heat Under sunshine pylons, we'll meet While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky I can't see you now my heart is frozen All the bowses and the growses Have been abstinated in my soul I prayed on the immovable Yet clinging to the atoms of rock Seasons see adjustment signs of change I can't see now, she said, "Taxi"Now that light is all I can take This dawn brings strange loyalties and skies I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower That you made with plastic power Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far awayYou are now tuned into the tomb of Jehova Play my tunes loud enough to shake the room, what's the hold up Heard the world is ending soon I assumed that they told yaÂ They tryna dinosaur us so now it's time to go up The sky's falling, baby Drop that ass 'fore it crash The sky's falling, baby Drop that ass 'fore it crash The sky's falling, baby Drop that ass 'fore it crash The sky's falling, baby Drop that ass 'fore it crash The roof is on fire, she wet like Barbra Streisand Police everywhere, it's like a nigga killed a white man I just wanna find a baby mama 'fore the night end So don't be coming 'round Vince on that batter ram shit On that 911 shit, need a misses brown as Missy I can have some fun with, them slave bones make Grace Jones Don't stop, bitch, stay focused, they hated on us since days of Moses

you You've just been thinking That's what you do, baby Hold it down, there Jump with them all and move it Jump back and forth And feel like you were there yourself To work it out Never did no harm, never did no harm It's dare It's coming up, it's coming up It's coming up, it's coming up It's coming up It's dare You've got to press it on you You've just been thinking That's what you do, baby Hold it down, there Jump with them all and move it Jump back and forth And feel like you were there yourself Work it outWhen the passing looks to die for Take it in your heart now, lover When the case is out And tired and sodden Take it in your heart Take it in your heart Back to when it was cool'Cause there's no substitute Who even knows the truth The truth, the truth Take it in your heart now, lover Take it in your heart Take it in your heart Take it in your heart Where it all goes down Outside, cold and ghosting out with jet lag I took it to the right man Took it all back When the courts were closing It was Bobby gracing I know that I put it to the right man He put it backSlow it down some, no split, clown bum Your gold hits sound dumb, hold it now, crown 'em Where you found them at Got 'em 'round town, could've drowned in it Would have floated, bloated, voted Sugar-coated, loaded hip shooter Draw for the poor, free coffee at the banks Hit through the straw, none more for me, thanks That blanks the raw, that dank sure stank lit Sank past the pit for more hardcore prank spit Crank it on blast, roll past Front Street Blew the whole spot like some old ass with skunk meat These kids is too fast, juiced off a junk treat Who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat Something has started today Where did it go  What you want it to be Well, you know November has come When it's gone away Something has started today Where did it go  What you want it to be Well, you know November has come When it's gone awayI need a gun to keep myself among Poor people who are burning in the sun But they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance I need a gun 'cause all I do is dance'Cause all I do is dance I need a gun to keep myself among The poor people who are burning in the sun But they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance I need a gun 'cause all I do is dance'Cause all I do is dance In my backpack, I got my act right in case you act quite difficult And your result weaken with anger and discontent Some are seekin' and searchin' like Nimoy I'm a peace-loving decoy, ready for retaliation I change your whole location to a pine box, six under Impulsive, don't ask why or wonder Orders given to me is strike and I'm thunder With lightning-fast reflexes On constant alert from the constant hurt That seems limitless with no drop in pressure It seems like everybody's out to test ya 'til they see you break You can't conceal the hate that consumes you I'm the reason why you fill up your Isuzu Chill with your old lady at the tilt I got a ninety-day extension and I'm filled with guilt From things done and seen Your water's from a bottle, mine's from a canteen At night I hear the shots ring, so I'm a light sleeper The cost of life, it seems to get cheaper Out in the desert with my street sweeper"The war is over", so said the speaker With the flight suit on Maybe to him, I'm just a pawn So he can advance Remember when I used to dance Man, all I wanna do is dance
