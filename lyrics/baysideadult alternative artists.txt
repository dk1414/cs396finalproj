Well, I’ve been dead all day Could you tell  Could you tell This is where I leave here and I save myself If there’s a God in Hell, let us pray, let us pray To be cleansed of everything that we’ve said When I fall asleep, can this fade away Oh my God, I am so full of shit I’ve been playing a part ever since I was a kid Now the bullshit is adding up and I’ve had enough of it But the crash would be incredible to see Well, I’ve been dead all day Could you tell  Could you tell This is where I leave here and I save myself If there’s a God in Hell, let us pray, let us pray To be cleansed of everything that we’ve said When I fall asleep, can this fade away I feel like Abraham on his little trip When all he found was death and pain and he never regretted it Oh, there’s something out there for me so I think I’d better split There sure as Hell ain’t nothing here for meTrying to create something that's not there A spark I saw as a bomb is just a means to an end And I was just so happy to be out of my shell again Don't think that I really cared for who or what So for now I'll just have to keep it shut If you're not ready, you're not ready Please stop acting like you are How could I know That everything you say are lies About devotion and desire And I know the spark Inside your eyes was just the match I used to set myself on fire My mouth's shooting blanks Situation's unbearable I've gotten vulnerable Now anyone is free to waltz right in My temple's been invaded And there's nobody guarding it All over this lonely life But what's so wrong with being all alone Alone's the only way I've ever knownI curse to hell the magistrate Who granted this unholy fate But I know, I know I asked for this myself I'm bound by law to hell And it's sick, sick, sick, humans and their needs Living in a fairytale that's tearing at the seams A dank reject, a devil in a dress Exactly what you seem Sick, sick, sick It's sick, sick, sick You made a mess of things My, what a mess you've made I hate the way you make me feel I hate the way you make me In your world, it's cold outside So button up and open wide I hate the way you make me feel Sick, sick, sick Oh OhI know, I know I should be better I think I am to some degree I can't explain why it gets harder The more people count on me Maybe it's all in my head And nothing's changed and I'm still in the basement With no tattoos or mortgage payments Well I'm not so good with tenses I'm tensing up thinking about What I'm supposed to call you now It takes a lot to shake me My body breaks to figure out How to leave the past behind When it surrounds all of the time And I don't know what I should call you now I don't know what I should call you now I don't believe that anyone runs From their past so easily Unless they run towards someone else, and I've seen you lacing up for years I guess your future looks great Well good for you You're still my inspiration But less in tune and more abrasiveI’ve been tucked in at the bottom of this lake And I’ve begun to settle in It could be worse, I guess I’ve been tucked in at the bottom of this lake And I’ve begun to settle in It could be worse, I guess Nothing’s ever great and no one ever wins But if you try your best you can get used to anything I’m running out of air but I blame myself for diving in I can’t believe this is my life I’m pretty vacant all the time And I’ve got no home I can’t believe this is my life I’m pretty vacant all the time I’ve been here before as two different men I wrote my own routine Now I can’t call the shots And uncomfortable is so comforting We can call it off, or not It’s all the same to me Because you’re running out of gas And I’m still at home trying to find my keysI met Mary on a moonless night Her starry eyes could make the world look bright Young and perfect, and full of life She said, “we’re gonna make it out one night”We’re gonna make it out one night As time passed, we both got old From the bar she lived above, she sat and wrote By the light of blue and yellow neon sign She wrote, “we’re gonna make it out one night”We’re gonna make it out one night So go on work all your angles out Get a plan together, get your demons out Cause Mary the world wants to bring you down But don’t you let ‘em I ran into her in Union Square Her starry eyes were looking dim and scared With a cigarette providing all the light She said, “we’re gonna make it out one night”We’re gonna make it out one night It rained the night I said goodbye When I lit her candle I never thought to cry Cause Mary, you never were the staying kind You were gonna make it out one night You were gonna make it out one nightIt's getting cold Thought it was too soon to tell But it was terribly old And as the heartbeat slows To a heartless crawl The lights went out The lights went out And darkness filled the house On a tiring night under Long Island sky I thought I'd known the consequence Sweetness, can you believe this Mess we've made of it This mess we've made of it In years to come, ​it might make sense Sweetness, can you believe this So what's become of it  What's become of it If you hear this and you think you're ready Then meet me at Montauk Where we'll write out in the sand"Here lies the destiny of 2 hurt souls Afraid to be cured again."That could be our epitaphWell, I’ve been dead all day Could you tell  Could you tell This is where I leave here and I save myself If there’s a God in Hell, let us pray, let us pray To be cleansed of everything that we’ve said When I fall asleep, can this fade away Oh my God, I am so full of
