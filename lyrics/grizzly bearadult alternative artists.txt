Oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh Save up all the days A routine malaise Just like yesterday I told you I would stay Oh-oh-oh Would you always  Maybe sometimes  Make it easy  Take your time Oh-oh-oh Think of all the ways Momentary phase Just like yesterday I told you I would stayYet again, we're the only ones No surprise, this is often how it's done Lately it's about all I can take I will move, mend and mold this break Shell with another crack I'm small but I can keep track Too soon, everyone just step away I'm sure this isn't the last play Take it all in stride Speak, don't confide We barely have a case It's done before we try It's darkened and by night A desert in your face Keep score, even playing feels this game I know when all said we're the same If I could I would leave it all be No chance to move backwards and see Take it all in stride Speak, don't confide We barely have a case It's done before we try It's darkened and by night A desert in your face Take it all in stride Speak, don't confide We barely have a case It's done before we try It's darkened and by night A desert in your faceI'm going to take a stab at this Surely we'll be alright Make a decision with a kiss Maybe I have frostbite And when I shuffled on back home I made sure all of my tracks in the snow were gone Tissue and bones it was a tryst This isn't a gunfight Checking it off of my list Unable to rewrite Five years, countless months and a loan Hope I'm ready, able to make my own good home They go, we go, I want you to know What I did, I did They go, we go, I want you to know What I did, I did They go, we go, I want you to know What I did, I did They go, we go, I want you to know What I did, I did They go, we go, I want you to know What I did, I did They go, we go, I want you to know What I did, I didI made a mistake I should have never tried I took the cake Finished every slice I moved away Still paying off the fines For every day That I shared, I left a lie I stare at my face Looking through my eyes I move at a pace That I cannot survive I'm holing away I do it all the time Let love age And watch it burn out and die I woke to the sound of dogs To the sound of distant shots and passing trucks We walked with the mourning sound It's the sound of distant shots and passing trucks We walked with the mourning sound It's the sound of distant shots and passing trucksWill you move on again See that turn, I have to flee again You always make it alright Is that the way it is Let's get along again Even though you moved around the bend Why is that the way it is The morning always shows all I wanna show you my best side I wanna be the guy who's right I want you to see things clearly I wanna make it alright Don't you be so easy Don't you know that I can make it better Don't you ever leave me Don't you feel it all come together Don't you be so easy Don't you know that I can make it better Don't you ever leave me Don't you feel it all come together You've fallen once, you'll fall again And lean on Your tired hands that crawl and grasp The soft ground By the look on your face You set out on a path Never to arrive By the look on your face The burden's on your back And the sun is in your eyes Stretched out, far and wide The light that scorched the sand So bright, so long I'm never coming back Every stone and every step I won't recall Emptied of every thought Just soft groundWhen I woke up today I was so bound To a memory cut long ago I could hear all your words echo on down And then my heart rate dropped to a crawl Move too fast Here we are Can't let go Take the past Own your scars Let it show Could I ask of you not to cut into me Dividing all of my body for me I was left here to go through all the pieces Nothing more to spare I keep looking for reasons to come 'round To make sense of your internal row But it's a maze and there's nothing to be found It just leads me away from my end goal Move too fast Here we are Can't let go Take the past Own your scars Let it showDreamed the long day Just wandering free Though I'm far gone You sleep nearer to me If I could find peace If this night leaves But I can't help myself So I'll walk out These wandering dreams Up the north road Dressed gold and green If I could lie still As that great hill But I can't help myself Well, it's calm and it's clear Collapsed here on the stone Delivered to this place A vision dark and cloakedThose saints in lockstep Across the wasteland Forever gone They're home and walk along Plod ever onward Across some tundra The light is long But it's not long before it's gone Well fine It calls you back to mind At once, at last Oh goodness, mercy mine Soldier on, but please not so long This time Too young and thoughtless To comb your memories I know it's wrong Just give until it's gone Some tired mantra Calls ever onward Shout it loud Just make it up somehow Well alrightOh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh Save up all the days A routine malaise Just like yesterday I told you I would stay Oh-oh-oh Would you always  Maybe sometimes  Make it easy  Take your time Oh-oh-oh Think of all the ways Momentary phase Just like yesterday I told you I would stay
