take you higher Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire Sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull And cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my skull At night I wake with the sheets soaking wet And a freight train running through the middle of my head Only you can cool my desire Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fireThere's a little girl in my neighborhood She's part made of metal, she's part made of wood She's got a steel eye and a heart of stone Her favorite theme song is "I walk alone"She's so cold, she's so cold She's so, she's so, she's so cold She's so

the same Through sun and rain Sixteen and crazy We were rugged and free We’d get loud and we’d always be Forever wild Forever wild Forever wild Forever wild Now as the years rolled by like a mystery train Chasing blood through my vein Somethings can get lost in a hurricane But some remain Sixteen and crazy We were aching to be We were living for each other Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo Whoo, whoo, whoo,

full view Beautiful you Whose hair flows down like honey cross a shoulder blade or two Beautiful you Who speaks to me in riddles and multiples my skull Who offers me a lolly and bring me back for more Beautiful you, beautiful you Whose eyes shine like midnight underneath the cobalt blue Beautiful you Whose fingers reach and touch me deep when no one else get true Beautiful you Who laughs inside the raindrops and says just let it fall Who never gets more crazy and parks it by the door Beautiful you, beautiful you Beautiful you, Beautiful you I’ll shout it from the rooftops across Lonely Avenue The angels in infinity whisper that it’s true Whose light shines from the darkness Tell me who now is it, who Who meets me on the moonlight on the way to Capnanieu Beautiful you Who crawled across a barbed wire fence to pick a rose or two Beautiful you I’ll carve it in the mountains and I’ll burn it in the sky This world is rough but I know there’s a place for you and I I’ll hold you and I’ll thrill you and I’ll give you what I own Cause every single kiss you give cuts right down to the bone Beautiful you, beautiful youHey Anybody looking for the sea of love Say hell yeah Anybody here who
