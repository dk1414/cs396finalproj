If you wanna talk to me yeah Know that I am plain to see yeah, yeah Yeah...I don't want this fame to be Staining my reality, yeah Yeah...Don't lift me up To tear me down I just want a lover Baby stay with me on the ground Drop with me, let me go Got to keep it low Drop with me, let me go Got to keep it low Don't lift me up To tear me down I just want a lover Baby stay with me on the ground Drop with me, let me go Got to keep it low Drop with me, let me go Got to keep it low, whoooI wish that I could fly Into the sky So very high Just like a dragonfly I'd fly above the trees Over the seas In all degrees To anywhere I please Oh I want to get away I wanna fly away I want to get away I wanna fly away Let's go and see the stars The Milky Way Or even Mars Where it could just be ours Let's fade into the sun Let your spirit fly Where we are one Just for a little fun Oh, oh, oh yeahHere we are still together We are one So much time wasted Playing games with love So many tears I've cried So much pain inside But, baby, it ain't over 'til it's over So many years we've tried To keep our love alive But, baby, it ain't over 'til it's over How many times Did we give up But we always worked things out And all my doubts and fears Kept me wondering, yeah If I'd always, always be in love So many tears I've cried So much pain inside But, baby, it ain't over 'til it's over So many years we've tried And kept our love alive But, baby, it ain't over 'til it's overI was born long ago I am the chosen, I'm the one I have come to save the day And I won't leave until I'm done So that's why you've got to try You got to breathe and have some fun Though I'm not paid, I play this game And I won't stop until I'm done But what I really want to know is Are you going to go my way And I got to, got to know I don't know why we always cry This we must leave and get undone We must engage and rearrange And turn this planet back to one So tell me why we got to die And kill each other one by one We've got to hug and rub-a-dub We've got to dance and be in love But what I really want to know is Are you going to go my way And I got to, got to knowI've been searching for you I heard a cry within my soul I've never had a yearning quite like this before Know that you are walking right through my door All of my life Where have you been I wonder if I'll ever see you again And if that day comes I know we could win I wonder if I'll ever see you again A sacred gift of heaven For better worse, wherever And I would never let somebody break you down Until you cried, never All of my life Where have you been I wonder if I'll ever see you again And if that day comes I know we could win I wonder if I'll ever see you again You are the flame in my heart You light my way in the dark You are the ultimate star You pick me up from above Your unconditional love Takes me to paradise I belong to you And you You belong to me too You make my life complete You make me feel so sweet You make me feel so divine Your soul and mind are entwined Before you, I was blind But since I've opened my eyes And with you there's no disguise So I could open up my mind I always loved you from the start But I could not figure out That I had to do it every day So I put away the fight Now I'm gonna live my life Giving you the most in every wayAmerican woman, stay away from me American woman, mama, let me be Don't come hanging around my door I don't want to see your face no more I got more important things to do Than spend my time growing old with you Now woman, stay away American woman, listen what I say

mama said Don't take more than a mouthful And my mama said That it's good to be natural And my mama said That it's good to be factual
