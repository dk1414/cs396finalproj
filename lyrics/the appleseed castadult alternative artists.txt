The reaching ocean Walked for days The reaching ocean You are mine The falling skyline Is washed away This empty notion You are mine Fishing the sky The reaching ocean Walked for days The reaching ocean You are mine The falling skyline Is washed away This empty notion You are mineAnd there on the stairs, standing there Arm outstretched, point and glare Watching the love fall to our feet Into the floor to disappear We’re finding fault, when you kissed her Or you slept with him or you didn’t care Now it all breaks, disintegrates Well this is the last thing I’ll take'Cause I can’t face you now This is the end, there’s nothing to keep This is the end of you and me As the ice comes down it’s the end As the lies come out it’s the end As the tears flow out it’s the end It's the end of you and me So we’ll look out on the lake and we see the white light I said it was gold, it should have been gold Then maybe all the crazy things you said would have a meaning But this thing we have made It can't stop, it won't stop'Cause I can’t face you nowFall down Marigold Fall sounds of rain Why can't I go Those days when spokes wound baseball cards tear hear them roar And faster still those boards which let fly souls Honeysuckle walk right afternoon time dies Wish for sometime soon I'll work it out My way So many faces So lost Why can't I go back when this mess was not made Forever turns out just the same as two months That rages on then afterWake up, you'll see The sun is rising over us And it's time to leave We've got one day to give One day to work and live And hold the world as it changes The destroyer The destroyer Wake up, you'll see A million years ago Waking up the darkness And as the stars are fleeting We are pulled to greeting Finding love beneath it in it's time The destroyer The destroyerThis county road I've fallen away I've fallen away This country road...To a place unknown I traveled away I traveled away I fall into nothin'The sea side road Has fallen away Has fallen away I have to go My place is sold I've fallen away I've fallen away I fall into nothin'The sky has turned again You can't fight And you won't die MemoryTear down the gates Any where the  come take control Who is defied Ocean, wave or mountain That takes it's final toll In time, wind conquers down to us Waves, who've spoken our names disappear We're first inside there Or else the sea will hold Take back your names Break the spell of dreaming And put your feet to the path Be filled with awe Remember all the love you'll bring Carry it with you through the storm In time, wind conquers down to us Waves, who've spoken our names disappear We're first inside there Or else the sea will holdLast thing I saw This winding road goes through that valley ahead This day what fear I'm already dead What shock to find I'm free Cut loose from the binds I invented for me This now I claim In love Insane Kicked down Thank you I would have been so lost without your pain What shock to find I'm free Cut loose the binds I invented for me"Your lies are too much for you" he says Twisting tree this wind world Eyes blinded Last thing I saw This winding road goes through that valley ahead This day what fear I'm already dead What shock to find I'm free I'm free Cut loose from the binds I invented for meI'm hoping I feel a way on a stage In a home that’s feeling the weight I know I'm not perfect, it's clear, I failed It could feel like we’re the same ___ Freefall, freefall getting upset I'm hoping I feel a way on a stage In a home that's feeling the weight Cold friend You seem to know again The four hearts All the cards in your deck The sun is gray Hoping for your soon return The sun will raise You will know the colors dancing You started making yourself up We stand there waiting for sunlight You and I will save the fire You and I You and I will save the fireNow I get the lesson Of the words that my father said Life ain't easy But if you do it right, it’s worth it You've got to watch your back And take care of those with less than you No one goes alone The carnivores are bigger than all of us Do not worry Where would you carry extra Never lose the fire You're gonna need it on this journeyIce to fire of your brethren You're all I see Ice to fire of your brethren You're all I see No one can say where the It had fallen down Next to the ground And rising up through the atmosphere We aren't staying here, the path is calm and clear Make a sound Ice to fire of your brethren You're all I see Ice to fire of your brethren You're all I-
