You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies Lit up the world as I fell asleep'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare I'd like to make myself believe That planet Earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep'Cause everything is never as it seems'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs As they tried to teach me how to dance A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed A disco ball is just hanging by a thread I'd like to make myself believe That planet Earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep'Cause everything is never as it seems Leave my door open just a crack'Cause I feel like such an insomniac Why do I tire of counting sheep When I'm far too tired to fall asleep The stars lean down to kiss you And I lie awake and miss you Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere'Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly But I'll miss your arms around me I'd send a postcard to you, dear'Cause I wish you were here I'll watch the night turn light blue But it's not the same without you Because it takes two to whisper quietly The silence isn't so bad'Til I look at my hands and feel sad'Cause the spaces between my fingers Are right where yours fit perfectly I'll find repose in new ways Though I haven't slept in two days'Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone But drenched in vanilla twilight I'll sit on the front porch all night Waist-deep in thought because when I think of you I don't feel so alone I don't feel so alone I don't feel so alone As many times as I blink, I'll think of you Tonight I'll think of you tonightHmm-mmm-mmm Woah-oh-oh-oh It's always a good time Woah-oh-oh-oh It's always a good time Woke up on the right side of the bed What's up with this Prince song inside my head Hands up, if you're down to get down tonight 'Cause it's always a good time Slept in all my clothes, like I didn't care Hopped into a cab, take me anywhere I'm in if you're down to get down tonight'Cause it's always a good time Good morning and goodnight I wake up at twilight It's gonna be alright We don't even have to try, it's always a good time Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh It's always a good time Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh We don't even have to try, it's always a good timeSwitch on the sky and the stars glow for you Go see the world 'cause it’s all so brand new Don’t close your eyes 'cause your future’s ready to shine It’s just a matter of time before we learn how to fly Welcome to the rhythm of the night There’s something in the air you can’t deny It's been fun but now I've got to go Life is way too short to take it slow But before I go and hit the road I got to know, 'til then, when can we do this again Oh oh, oh oh When can I see you again Oh oh, oh oh When can we do this again Woah oh, oh oh I got to know , when can I see you again  When my hope is lost and my strength is gone I run to You, and You alone When I can't get up, and I can't go on I run to You, and You alone Cause You're my light in the dark And I sing with all of my heart Hallelujah, my almighty God divine Hallelujah, I am Yours and You are mine This is all I know how to say Hallelujah, Hallelujah You're my everything When I'm plagued with pain, and filled with fear I run to You, and You alone When my days are few, and death is near I run to You, and You alone Cause You're my light in the dark And I sing with all of my heartHe doesn't fight crime or wear a cape He doesn't read minds or levitate But every time my world needs saving He's my Superman Some folks don't believe in heroes'Cause they haven't met my dad He loves his workshop and rock 'n roll He's got a hot rod and a heart of gold And you could say he's a man of few words But he talks a lot within And even though' I'm a little taller I still look up to him He built me a house in the arms of a tree He taught me to drive and to fight and to dream When he looks in my eyes, I hope he can see that My dad's a hero to me Rust ridden fenders and doors full of dings Somehow he can fix about anything I didn't think he knew how to cry Till our dog died that year He doesn't always say I love you But I can hear him loud and clearI am a light sleeper But I am a heavy dreamer My imagination gives me wings And I can go anywhere And when I wander away to some other place I'm suddenly there, way up in the air Where passenger trains catch fire and fill the sky with flames And that black rabbit of death wakes up in a breath Of beautiful dreams, my heartache, it seems So terribly vain, where fire and diamonds fall like rain Do you believe in endless miracles Do you believe in the impossible Do you believe sleep is a time machine Do you believe in curiosity Do you believe in what you cannot see Do you believe life is a lucid dream That’s how you study the stars That’s how you study the stars And that’s how you know them by heart Life is a lucid dreamGot an email at 22 Told me I could be a star On a plane for the first time I couldn't wait to start Landed at J FK Father Christmas picked me up Checked in to a dream hotel and I thought"There's no such thing as luck"I walked in to my interview And I thought, "There's no such thing as luck"And oh, if I only knew then what I know now I'd stand like a one-man band and I'd say All this is new to me but here's how it's gonna be And I'd say"Hey, there is more to me than meets the eye Let me be who I wanna be"And I’d say"Hey, I'm an oddity and that's alright Let me fly and follow my dreams"Then I'd say"Hey thanks for the weekend A good time was had by all"And I'd say"Hey, thanks for the weekend I ain't a smooth-talker but thanks for the Fiji Water"Thanks for the Fiji WaterI opened my eyes last night and saw you in the low light Walking down by the bay, on the shore Staring up at the stars that aren't there anymore I was feeling the night grow old and you were looking so cold So like an introvert, I drew my over shirt Around my arms and began to shiver violently before You happened to look and see the tunnels all around me Running into the dark underground All the subways around create a great sound To my motion fatigue, farewell, with your ear to a seashell You can hear the waves in underwater caves As if you actually were inside a saltwater room Time together is just never quite enough When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home What will it take to make or break this hint of love Only time, only time Can you believe that the crew has gone And they wouldn't let me sign on All my islands have sunk in the deep So I can hardly relax or even oversleep But I feel warm with your hand in mine When we walk along the shoreline I guess we'll never know why sparrows love the snow We'll turn out all of the lights and set this ballroom aglowClose your tired eyes, relax and then Count from 1 to 10 and open them All these heavy thoughts will try to weigh you down, but not this time Way up in the air you're finally free And you can stay up there right next to me All this gravity will try to pull you down, but not this time When the sun goes down, and the lights burn out Then it's time for you to shine Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are Fill the darkest night with a brilliant light'Cause it's time for you to shine Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are tonight Whoa, whoa, whoa Brighter than a shooting star Shine no matter where you are tonight Gaze into my eyes when the fire starts And fan the flame so hot it melts our hearts Oh, the pouring rain, we'll try to put it out, but not this time Let your colors burn and brightly burst Into a million sparks that all disperse And illuminate a world that'll try to bring you down, but not this time
