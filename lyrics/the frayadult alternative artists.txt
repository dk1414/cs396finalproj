Step one, you say we need to talk He walks, you say, "Sit down, it's just a talk"He smiles politely back at you You stare politely right on through Some sort of window to your right As he goes left and you stay right Between the lines of fear and blame You begin to wonder why you came Where did I go wrong  I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life Let him know that you know best'Cause after all, you do know best Try to slip past his defense Without granting innocence Lay down a list of what is wrong The things you've told him all along And pray to God He hears you And I pray to God He hears you, andI found God On the corner of First and Amistad Where the west Was all but won We're all alone Smokin' his last cigarette I said, "Where you been "He said, "Ask anything"Where were you When everything was fallin' apart Where all my days Were spent by a telephone That never rang And all I needed was a call That never came To the corner of First and Amistad Lost and insecure You found me, you found me Lyin' on the floor Surrounded, surrounded Why'd you have to wait Where were you  Where were you Just a little late You found me, you found meI never knew I never knew that everything was falling through That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue To turn and run when all I needed was the truth But that's how it's gotta be It's coming down to nothing more than apathy I'd rather run the other way than stay and see The smoke and who's still standing when it clears And everyone knows I'm in Over my head Over my head With eight seconds left in overtime She's on your mind, she's on your mind Let's rearrange I wish you were a stranger I could disengage Just say that we agree and then never change Soften a bit until we all just get along But that's disregard You find another friend and you discard As you lose the argument in a cable car Hanging above as the canyon comes betweenIf I don't say this now, I will surely break As I'm leaving the one I wanna take Forgive the urgency, but hurry up and wait My heart has started to separate Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby I'll look after you There now, steady love, so few come and don't go Will you, won't you be the one I'll always know When I'm losing my control, the city spins around You're the only one who knows, you slow it down Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby I'll look after you And I'll look after you If ever there was a doubt My love, she leans into me This most assuredly counts She says most assuredlySome things we don't talk about Rather do without and just hold the smile Falling in and out of love Ashamed and proud of, together all the while You can never say never While we don't know when But time and time again Younger now than we were before Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go Picture, you're the queen of everything Far as the eye can see under your command I will be your guardian when all is crumbling I'll steady your handWords are fallin' on our skin Like water torture, you get in my head You call me this, and I call you that There's too much talkin', mmm So please don't speak M, my heart is havin' trouble with the beat, beat, beat So try to take it slow We can't speak I want it, I'm just tryin' to find the beat, beat, beat My heart is singing low We can lay together We're closer than we've ever been Stay right here forever And break each other off again Where we're going, that promised land We made that promise, you gave me your hand All that talkin', it pulled us in Say you'd never leave, can we promise that Be still and know that I'm with you Be still and know that I am here Be still and know that I'm with you Be still, be still and know When darkness comes upon you And covers you with fear and shame Be still and know that I'm with you And I will say your name If terror falls upon your bed And sleep no longer comes Remember all the words I said Be still, be still and know And when you go through the valley And shadow comes down from the hill If morning never comes to be Be still, be still, be still If you forget the way to go And lose where you came from If no one is standing beside you Be still and know I am Be still and know that I'm with you Be still and know I amIn the night, I hear 'em talk The coldest story ever told Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless How could you be so heartless How could you be so heartless How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo Just remember that you talkin' to me though You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo I mean after all the things that we've been through I mean after all the things we got into Yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me Yo, I did some things but that's the old me Now you wanna keep me back and you gon' show me So you walk around like you don't know me You got a new friend; I got homies But in the end it's still so lonely In the night, I hear 'em talk The coldest story ever told Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless How could you be so heartless How could you be so heartless The day's last one-way ticket train pulls in We smile for the casual closure capturing There goes the downpour Here goes my fare thee well There's really no way to reach me There's really no way to reach me There's really no way to reach me'Cause I'm already gone Only so many words that we can say Spoken upon long-distance melody This is my hello This is my goodness There's really no way to reach me There's really no way to reach me There's really no way to reach me'Cause I'm already gone Maybe in five or ten yours and mine will meet again Straighten this whole thing out Maybe then honesty need not be feared as a friend or an enemy This is the distance And this is my game faceStep one, you say we need to talk He walks, you say, "Sit down, it's just a talk"He smiles politely back at you You stare politely right on through Some sort of window to your right As he goes left and you stay right Between the lines of fear and blame You begin to wonder why you came Where did I go wrong  I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night
