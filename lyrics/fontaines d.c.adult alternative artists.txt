You're not alive until you start kicking When the room is spinning and the words ain't sticking And the radio is all about a runaway model with a face like sin and a heart like a James Joyce novel Saying "Sister, sister, how I missed ya, missed ya Let's go wrist to wrist and take the skin off of my blister"If you're a rockstar, pornstar, superstar, doesn't matter what you are Get yourself a good car, get outta here Well But the boys in the better land You're always talking 'bout the boys in the better land The boys in the better land But the boys in the better land You're always talking 'bout the boys in the better land The boys in the better land Driver's got names to fill two double barrels He spits out "Brits out", only smokes Carrolls And he's refreshing the world in mind, body and spirit Mind body and spirit You better hear it and fear it Oh, that's the spiritI love you, I love you, I told you I do It's all I've ever felt, I've never felt so well And if you don't know it, I wrote you this tune To be here loving you when I'm in the tomb I've eddied the heart now, from Dublin to Paris And if there was sunshine, it was never on me So close, the rain, so pronounced is the pain Yeah Well, I love you, imagine a world without you It's only ever you, I only think of you And if it's a blessing, I want it for you If I must have a future, I want it with you Systеm in our hearts, you only had it before You only opеn the window, never open up the door And I love you, I love you, told you I do Selling genocide and half-cut pride, I understand I had to be there from the start, I had to be the fucking man It was a clamber of the life, I sucked the ring off every hand Had 'em plying me with drink, even met with their demands When the cherries lined up, I kept the spoilings for myself'Til I had thirty ways of dying looking at me from the shelf Cloud-parting smile I had, a real good child I was But this island's run by sharks with children's bones stuck in their jaws Now the morning's filled with cokeys tryna talk you through it all Is their mammy Fine Gael and is their daddy Fianna Fáil And they say they love the land, but they don't feel it go to waste Hold a mirror to the youth and they will only see their face Makes flowers read like broadsheets, every young man wants to die Say it to the man who profits, and the bastard walks by And the bastard walks by, and the bastard walks by Say it to him fifty times and still the bastard won't cry Would I lie Ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh Life ain’t always empty Life ain’t always empty Life ain’t always empty Life ain’t always empty Life ain’t always empty Life ain’t always empty Don’t get stuck in the past Say your favourite things at mass Tell your mother that you love her And go out of your way for others Sit beneath a light that suits ya And look forward to a brighter future Life ain’t always empty Life ain’t always empty Life ain’t always empty Life ain’t always empty Life ain’t always empty Life ain’t always emptyDo do do La la la My friend Sally says she knows ya Got a funny point of view Says you've got away with murder Maybe one time, maybe two Something happens in the morning When I can't see those failing eyes I can't find a good word for ya Does it come as a surprise I don't think we rhyme I will wear you down in time I will hurt you, I'll desert you I am Jackie down the line Said did Sally 'bout a future Before you bored of her as well If all you want is entertainment If you can't have it you make hellI was down the bottom half of some old bar in Chinatown Me shoes had brought the rain and soaked the space for lookin' down As drunk as love is lethal, I spun a lady 'round And I kissed her 'neath the waking of a Dublin City sky She threw her shoes into her bag and danced just like a dream Her face was rubied up just like no sun I'd ever seen She said I was a phony, I said I could be mean And I treated her so badly I made my baby cry The January markets filled the cold air with the sound The boys all full of laughter and their pocket with the pound And in the foggy dew, I saw you throwing shapes around It was underneath the waking of a Dublin City sky And it all makes sour To watch my lover wrap her arms around the flag of power Hurry now you will To know you is to love you and I love you even still But we'll never truly be We trip along disaster in the whirlwind of the free Altogether nowYou're so real, I'm a show reel You work for money and the rest, you steal I feel like an old tattoo I feel like I'm falling for you Sha sha sha, sha sha sha Sha sha sha A cabbie pisses on the wheel of his own car Heads hit the streets, turn cheeks at stars There's always tears There's always gonna be tears There's always gonna be Sha sha sha, sha sha sha Sha sha sha, sha sha sha Under the lamplight's faded career Two men at a rickshaw pumping up a tyre Tire and tire and tire and tire Tire and tire and tire and tire And now the cabbie waits at invisible gates Shoulder to the curb Manic and wretching like a drunken perv Now here comes the sun That's another one done That's another oneGone is the day, gone is the night, gone is the day Gone is the day, gone is the night, gone is the day Gone is the day, gone is the night, gone is the day Gone is the day, gone is the night, gone is the day She defines the only answer And I never had the time She defines the only reason For feeling All in all is all we tailor And they always have the best And she defines the only reason For feeling Gone is the day, gone is the night, gone is the day Gone is the day, gone is the night, gone is the day Gone is the day, gone is the night, gone is the day Gone is the day, gone is the night, gone is the day She defines the only answer And I never had the time She defines the only reason For feeling All in all is all we tailor And they always have the best And she defines the only reason For feeling, ah, ahA sell-out is someone who becomes a hypocrite in the name of money An idiot is someone who lets their education do all of their thinking A phony is someone who demands respect for the principles they effect A dilettante is someone who can't tell the difference between fashion and style Charisma is exquisite manipulation And money is a sandpit of the soul Money is the sandpit of the soul Money is the sandpit of the soul Money is the sandpit of the soul Tailored dreams of having it all She documents an essence in a bathroom stall An empty cheers marks an empty occasion The empty glass is ringing, all across the nation All across the nation All across the nation All across the nation Well, the suits are runnin' and it won't be long Until the blues cop, what's really going on Well, the suits are runnin' and it won't be long Until the blues cop, what's really going on Baby, come on, get stoned, get stoned Get inside it, inside it, inside it, inside Get along, get along, get alone, get alone, get Heard about the week on the Dalymount seat, yeah Baby, come on, before the going gets gone Heard you lied to the Major, won't be long Well, I wish upon a wedding for a picture in the star When they knock for ya don't forget who you are Skinty Fia Baby, come on, whose sidе are you on I don't wanna see the queen I already sing hеr song While they're snuffing out hopes, and they're blotting out suns They claim to know the form in which genius comes, yeah Baby, come on, get your high heels on It’s the body is cold, it's the course is run What artless living all this soft pain thrills What calamities usher all our brilliance to the hills!Can you feel it Baby, come on, get stoned, get stoned Get inside it, inside it, inside it, inside Get along, get along, get alone, get alone, get Was it the weed or the moment that stoned ye Ah None can pull the passion loose from youth's ungrateful hands As it stands, I'm about to make a lot of money Gold harps in the pan None can revolution lead with selfish needs aside As I cried, I'm about to make a lot of money Gold harps on the side Is it too real for ya Is it too real for ya Is it too real for ya Is it too real The winter evening settles down The bruised and beat up open sky, six o'clock The city in its final dress And now a gusty shower wraps the grimy scraps Of withered leaves all about your feet And then the ringing of a twitching hand Six o'clock, six o'clock
