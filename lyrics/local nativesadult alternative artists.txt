Wait, when am I gonna lose you How will I let you slip through Careless or unkind Trace the curving of the coastline The Santa Lucia cliffside We'll stay here for the night I remember you said Everything has its place Now I lie in our bed Wondering how to explain You When am I gonna lose you When am I gonna lose you When am I gonna lose you When am I gonna lose Take another one if you need it Or do you already feel it I felt it from the start Engrave the silhouette of you dancing A shadow play that we're cast in On the cabin wallsFace stained in the ceiling Why does it keep saying"I don't have to see you right now""I don't have to see you right now"?Digging like you can bury Something that cannot die We could wash the dirt off our hands now Keep it from living underground Lazy summer goddess You can tell our whole empire"I don't have to see you right now""I don't have to see you right now""I don't have to see you right now""I don't have to see you right now""I don't have to see you right now""I don't have to see you right now"Finally what you came for Finally what you hoped to find Racing home from her house Looking out for black and white Dark days in the summer A million ways to toe the line Can't wait, holy other Might as well be the seventh sign Ooh, it goes hand in hand with fear for the afterlife Ooh, how can we fight it, fight it if we don't even know why While the dollar is strong While nobody else relies When they turn the corner When you know we're out of sight Dark days in the summer In the rain the water's fine It was wild combination Either that or right down the line Ooh, it goes hand in hand with fear for the afterlife Ooh, how can we fight it, fight it if we don't even know why I think we better listen to these kids We can't keep pretending we know what we're doing I can't keep pretending I'm afraid If you'll sit and listen I'll tell you a secret We can do whatever we want We can say whatever we mean I have waited so long, Mrs  President Matriarchs and Teddy Boys play in houses on the lake How can we quit drugs if you're gonna watch like that Give me five good reasons you trust us with our future We can do whatever we want We can say whatever we mean And if we don't care Then who cares We've been dreaming of you Drinking from fountains of youth And if we don't change Then who'll change We've been dreaming of you Drinking from fountains of youthTime stands still and then one day it's gone Where did it go Where did I go We couldn't wait to grow old But I can't fight the feeling anymore You know I tried I know you tried We're still waiting to arrive Ooh, how much is enough Ooh, how can you be sure of I start our day so late in the evening Ooh, how much is enough Nineteen hours from my door to yours I count the miles and all the while Waiting for the sun to rise But how come you can be so sure about everything when I go to sleep you're waking up Ooh, how much is enough Ooh, how can you be sure of I start our day so late in the evening Ooh, how much is enough Hey now, is it the dawn or the end The hours we talked You wished we'd stopped Acting like it's nothing at all In the first act, your gun on the wall The kick back into your Shoulder was always hard to ignore, hey Even if I'm on your side I saw the way you close your eyes Even if I'm on your side I saw the way you close your eyes Hey now, the slip, the doubt, the itch You bow so long to live beyond Now you walk in, humming your song Mirror in the bathroom, nails getting long Ah please, tell me I'm wrong In the third act, it's gotta go off, hey Even if I'm on your side I saw the way you close your eyes Even if I'm on your side I saw the way you close your eyesOh, some evil spirit, oh, some evil this way comes They told me how they fear it, now they're placing it on their tongues Oh, to see it with my own eyes Oh, to see it with my own eyes No food or water for the better part of ten months Quietly he sat between the folds of a tree trunk Oh, to see it with my own eyes Oh, to see it with my own eyes All the men of faith and men of science had their questions Could it ever be on earth as it is in heaven Oh, to see it with my own eyes Oh, to see it with my own eyesWaiting for My words to catch like I'm trying To strike a match that's soaking wet See through skull See through skin Leave all the lights on Can't see out, but they see in Stare down my nose, watching The color drain from my eyes Cold cereal and T VBefore I go to sleep Breathing out hoping to breathe in I know nothing's wrong but I’m not convinced No I know, I know, I've already told myself Maybe I'll believe it from somebody else No, I know, I know, I’ve already told myself Maybe I'll believe it from somebody else Breathing out Hoping to breathe in I know nothing’s wrong, but im not convinced I can't let it happen, just let it happen Just don't think so much, don't think so muchHaven't stopped your smoking yet So I'll share your cigarette Just to feel it in my fingers Walk around 'til 3 am Tell me what I know again To keep myself from second guessing All my silver dreams bring me to you Hold the summer in your hands'Til the summer turns to sand We were staring at our ceilings Thinking of what we'd give to have one more day of sun One day of sun Silver dreams bring me to you Silver dreams bring me to you Silver dreams bring me to youYou and I, we were always strong It was enough to keep me on Believe me And I woke up with my green eyes blue And all I think about is you And your fist Where did your love, where did your love grow cold The closer I get, the farther I have to go To places we don't know To places we don't know To places we don't know To places we don't know In all this light, all I feel is dark Had the sun without its' warmth I'm freezing Where did your love, where did your love grow cold The closer I get, the farther I have to go To places we don't know To places we don't know To places we don't know To places we don't know
