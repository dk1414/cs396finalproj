Waiting for a love like this Every time we say goodbye I wish we had one more kiss I'll wait for you, I promise you, I will, I'm93 million miles from the Sun, people get ready, get ready'Cause here it comes it's a light, a beautiful light, over the horizon into our eyes Oh, my my how beautiful, oh my beautiful mother She told me, "Son in life you're gonna go far, if you do it right you'll love where you are Just know, wherever you go, you can always come home"Ohh, ohh, ohh Ohh, ohh, ohh240 thousand miles from the Moon, we've come a long way to belong here To share this view of the night, a glorious night, over the horizon is another bright sky Oh, my my how beautiful, oh my irrefutable father He told me, "Son sometimes it may seem dark, but the absence of the light is a necessary part Just know, you're never alone, you can always come back home"Ohh, ohh, ohh Ohh, ohh, ohh You can always come back, back Every road is a slippery slope There is always a hand that you can hold on to Looking deeper through the telescope You can see that your home's inside of youIt could be love And we could be homies Once you get to know me I could be your one and only I could make you Unlonely Or we could take it slowly And we could keep it low key I could be your one and only I could make you Unlonely I've been chasing summer around Searching for the sunshine Looking for a good time Following the good vibes Listening to intuition as it's happening Diggin' into life cuz at times it can be saddening Yea it can be a grey day, if you're lonely A little rain suddenly turns heavy But a whole lotta love can make the clouds go away Maybe the time for us is now When the table's set for two And there's nobody with you Seeing movies by yourself Let me be your someone elseIt feels like we've been friends forever, yeah And we always see eye to eye The more time we spend together The more I wanna say what's on my mind Take it easy'Cause it ain't easy to say I wanna be more than friends I wanna be more than friends I wanna tell everyone you're taken And take your hand until the end I wanna be more than friends At the risk of sounding foolish I don't wanna fool around no more If we're gonna do this then let's do this You can fix my broken heart if it's all yours So take it easy'Cause it ain't easy to sayWas it you who spoke the words that Things would happen but not to me Oh, things are gonna happen naturally Oh, taking your advice and I'm looking on the bright side And balancing the whole thing Oh, but often times those words get tangled up in lines And the bright lights turn to night Oh, until the dawn it brings Another day to sing about the magic that was you and me'Cause you and I both loved What you and I spoke of And others just read of Others only read of the love, the love that I love, yeah See, I'm all about them words Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words Hundreds of pages, pages, pages for words More words than I had ever heard and I feel so alive'Cause you and I both loved What you and I spoke of And others just read of And if you could see me now Oh, love, love You and I, you and I Not so little, you and I, anymore, mmmI'm taking a moment just imaginin' that I'm dancin' with you I'm your pole, and all you're wearing is your shoes You got soul, you know what to do to turn me on until I write a song about you And you have your own engaging style And you've got the knack to vivify And you make my slacks a little tight You may unfasten them if you like That's if you crash and spend the night But you don't fold, you don't fade You've got everything you need, especially me Sister, you've got it all You make the call to make my day In your message say my name Your talk is all the talk, sister, you've got it all Curl your upper lip up and let me look around Ride your tongue along your bottom lip and bite down And bend your back and ask those hips if I can touch'Cause they're the perfect jumping off point of getting closer to your butterfly Well, you float on by Oh, kiss me with your eyelashes tonight Or Eskimo your nose real close to mine And let's mood the lights and finally make it rightWell, I saw fireworks from the freeway And behind closed eyes, I cannot make them go away'Cause you were born on the fourth of July, freedom ring Well, something on the surface, it stings I said, something on the surface, well, it kinda makes me nervous Who says that you deserve this And what kind of god would serve this We will cure this dirty old disease Well, if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy The remedy is the experience This is a dangerous liaison I says, the comedy is that it's serious Which is a strange enough new play on words I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend The rest of your nights with the light on So shine the light on all of your friends When it all amounts to nothing in the end I, I won't worry my life away Hey, oh, oh I, I won't worry my life away Hey, oh, oh
