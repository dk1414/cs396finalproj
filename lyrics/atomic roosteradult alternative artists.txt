answer we all chaseDeath walks behind you Death walks behind you Death walks behind you Death walks behind you Lock the door, switch the light You'll be so afraid tonight Hide away from the bad Count the nine lives that you had Start to scream, shout for help There is no one by your side To forget what is done Seems so hard to carry on Luck is false, that it's near Bring yourself to understand It's your fate or what's cast Point a finger at yourself Death walks behind you Death walks behind you Death walks behind you Death walks behind you Lock your door, switch the light You'll be so afraid tonight Hide away from the bad Count the nine lives that you hadSunshine, brighten up my mind Light up faded photographs time has left behind Sunshine, don't you shine on me Stare in mirrors of the past, trying to be free'Cos I can't find a reason for living without you Though I can't find a reason for living without you Oh, and that's true Daybreak  Now I must decide Time is knocking on my door, trying to get inside Time goes so slowly, yet it goes so fast A million tears will never change a second of the past'Cos I just can't find a reason for living without you No, I can't find a reason for living without you Oh, and, baby, that's trueDu Cann Take it from the hand that feeds you well Not giving any more You've been lost but I don't really care I'm closing up my door Had a chance you let it drift away You threw it in my face Give it all I can, there's nothing left But what I'm left to waste, what I'm left to waste Can't take no more, can't take no more Get yourself another fool One who's gonna treat you well Tell you I can't take no more You've taken all I had to give Take, take, take Take, take, take You're the one who laughed, though how I know It makes no difference now Used to take it all, just come and see Decision by the hour Such a shame it had to end this way I used to really care Feelings that I had for you have died I just can't take no more, I just can't take no moreCrane When I wake up in your bed I can still hear what you said Like a bad dream I can't fight Tomorrow night Am I lying next to you Am I thinking I need to Really love you  Do it right Tomorrow night Time goes so slow when you're gone Days turn to years, it seems so long If you still feel like today If tomorrow's the same way Then I know it'll be right Tomorrrow night Can't you trust me to see it through Can't you wait 'till I see you When you're working, you're uptight Tomorrow night Time goes so slow when you're gone Days turn to years, it's seem so longCrane-Darnell

on something she wouldn't mind She pretended that she didn't see It's all a game that's scary for me But then she, oh she, she is my woman But then she, oh she, she is my woman She gets me alone when she says she feels high But it's scary for me, she's a real born liar She does something she can't control But I can do so much to let her know No, no, no, no Then she, oh she,she is my woman, my
