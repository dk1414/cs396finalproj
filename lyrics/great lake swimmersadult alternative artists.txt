Oh, you've been here before Minus one, split and it’s done Getting up every day Minus one every way Oh, but nothing’s the same Minus two, no one to blame Minus one in the street A conceit in degrees Minus two now we’re gone Minus you now we’re done So turn on your inner light Zero in the city tonight Oh, you’ve been here before Minus one, split and it’s done So turn on your inner light Zero in the city tonight Hard to feel a single thing inside Zero in the city tonightAwake me please when this is over Oh, when the ice is melted away And the hunger returns I will be the same but older And maybe twice the man that I thought I was Where have you been And what have you done I've been under the ground Reading prayers from this old book I found Under the ground Saving it up And spending it all On moving pictures Silent films Moving pictures Silent films Oh, and is this the dream I've been saving Oh, where the heart beats slower and slower To almost nothing Almost nothing Almost nothing I took it for love Or at least something beautiful Out there in the spotlight But turned around softly Turned around squintingSo little space in the degrees in between us Moving so fast, hardly anybody notices Into a constant and restless dream It's written on my hands, and this is what I mean A strand of hair, a certain hue These are my hands, they belong to you And how to talk you into believing yourself And how to get ready for the change in the weather And how to pack all of the things for the trip And what will you do, what will you do when you get there A single frame passing on a screen These are my hands, and this is what I mean Hiding there, in plain sight I see you in a certain light I couldn't smile when I needed to But you were there when I needed youThere is a light in you I have fallen into There is a light in you I have fallen into Fallen in too Put all your weapons away I won't fight you just to spite you Put all your weapons away And your mask, it's failing anyway Falling away Stop, listen, feel Stop, listen, feel Stop, listen, feel Believe, believe And if love is a war I won't have any more If this is what we call a war I won't have it anymore Stop, listen, feel Stop, listen, feel Stop, listen, feel Believe, believeWhen I grow up, maybe I'll be a veterinarian I'll take care of little animals Like ponies and parakeets And I'll give them food to eat While the puppies go, "Yip, yip, yip"And the kittens go, "Meow, meow, meow"And, "Thank you, veterinarian!"Maybe I'll be an astronaut and work for N AS AMaybe I'll see you on the moon I'll see you on the moon I'll see you on the moon There's lots of things that you can be When you grow up, just wait and see When I grow up, maybe I'll be a farmer Grow all kinds of food to eat Like shiny apples, red or green, or fields of corn for dinnertime I'll drive my tractor in the sun While the chickens go, "Bock, bock, bock"And the cows go, "Moo, moo, moo"And, "Thank you, farmer!"I will never see the sun Spadina, St  George, Bay, and Yonge One for nothing, all for one Spadina, St  George, Bay and Yonge Hey you look like royalty Weren't you born with muddy feet Hoarse, in high tops, totally lost Those two streets will never meet So the map says 'you are here'Waltzing in a garbage pile Sweating like a weather's vein Coughing thunder, sneezing rain There's a rag just up the street Eats his history to keep warm Got some blankets, got some bags Screams confessions, shouts in vainA weightless breath, the air alive Swords of water cutting the sides through half-closed eyes A marble curtain floating down Swimming into fishes' mouths and waving through In the call of the wind In the ways of the sea You won't believe What's up there Tracing the great green pathways A forest of arms turning into fins Ancient veins on granite chins And avian songs fill the air with notes diving in The hard edges green with newly grown coats Where do we draw the line And put this on the line Where do we draw the lines And stray so far with these designs The night water's deep Kissing the lamb Luminous and green From magic hands As if it springs up As born from inside The real spell surrounds Transcendent and whiteReal or imagined, it hardens into habit Stains on a Saturday, watch it burn away Heart flush with heaviness, under the heavens Hovering above, a feeling Can't reach it Uncertain country, shifting underneath Couldn't see it coming, or where it's coming from In the air, in the clouds, long gone Beyond belief Can't reach it Uncertain country Uncertain country Rusted machinery, language, and the battery Years sitting idle, fading in front of me Steel fingers in the earth, determining its worth Bones on the surface, left to weather Pulled into the future, now what are you supposed to do Passed just as fast, the eye to pull the future through Living in the present, in the moment Not ahead, not behind, or below Can't reach itMaybe I was missing something initially And maybe eventually it will all make sense Snakes against angels and stairways to heaven I'm shaking all over and I can't control it Did you think it was easy, and nearly fall into it Wonder if you see it beyond the lip service Try to accept that it's hard enough I'm telling you, it's rough Every day could be our last Burning, darling, burning fast Time won't slow for anyone Out on the tracks at a quarter to one I accept you, as impossible as it sounds Impossible the more the barrier Going down with the ship with a smile, with the family There aren't any lifeboats to heaven around here Just misguided people playing Russian roulette Mistaking kindness for weakness Thinking like giants and acting like children Strangers in a hurryI've been talking with the wind a lot Throwing words out that I've kept too long We breathe the same way when we're drawn I know I have a friend in it Ah, your fingers weave, above the trees Ah, the talking wind, the turning leaves As you left, a force, to fly on You left a fragment to be played upon Fallen and  grown new, the wind restored It went right through I stood in it's way and became it Ah, your fingers weave, above the trees Ah, the talking wind, the turning leaves Ah, your shoulder blades, among the waves Ah, you fly away, and dissipate The wind makes sound instead of words And I think I understand Neither needs to explain in turn It cries out, and I understand
