All on my own Here I stand Am I humble  Am I ghost I'm on a limb to climb To something lawless I hope Am I humble  Am I ghost I'll find a way To look towards this day Got it all hooked up This could only go one way Oh oh oh oh oh I'm not alive I'm not alive enough I'm not alive I'm not alive enough Love is to die Love is to not die Love is to dance Love is to dance and dance Love is to die Love is to not die Love is to dance Love is to dance and danceOne, two, three, four I've got a friend with a melody that will kill She'll eat you alive Like cyanide it's poison She'll eat you alive Don't you battle, we'll kill you We'll rip you up and tear you in two Don't you battle, we'll kill you We'll rip you up and tear you in two Don't you battle, we'll kill you We'll rip you up and tear you in two Only in the sound of the voices I scream I heard my name, now I'm gone, tell me what I did You saw me standing on my lone mountain Dare me to play, not to put it off The tears are not worth the wait Your loveliness is so worth it You're another one in a long, long time Wrestling people for peace Wrestling people for peaceB  I  L  L  I  E  H  O  L  I  D  A  Y B  I  L  L  I  E  H  O  L  I  D

you want to know me I'm a war companion Nothing you can say can tear me away from my guy Nothing you can do 'cause I'm stuck like glue to my guy I'm sticking to my guy like a stamp to a letter Like birds of a feather, we stick together I'm telling you from the start, I won't be torn apart from my guy Nothing you can buy could make me tell a lie to my guy Nothing you could do could make me untrue to my guy I gave my guy my word of honor to be faithful and I'm gonna You best be believing I won't be deceiving my guy As a matter of opinion, I think he's tops My opinion is he's the cream of the crop As a matter of taste, to be exact He's my ideal as a matter of fact No muscle-bound man can tear me away from my guyYou wouldn't know it but you're really in your prime Is there a question not answered in your mind Before you know the answer, you're running out of time There is an anchor, I'll put it in my heart You gotta do what's right for you, and do it from the start Even when they wonder, they wonder where you are You know what I want To know the secrets in your heart And now I keep it low There's just some things I don't need to know Don't go tonight Don't go tonight You oughta know it, but it happens all the time Is there a question  You treat it like a crime And in the walls you weaken, and out the walls you climb Oh, why is it not all that it seems You lock it up so easily I wanna believe all that you say to me Ooooh You know what I want To rip it open and pull it out And we'll take it low There's just some things I don't need to knowYour brown eyes are my blue skies They light up the rivers that the birds fly over Better not to quench your thirst Better not to be the first one diving in Though you caught me and you know why You breathe in the deepest part of the water What’s the matter  You hurt yourself Opened your eyes and there was someone else Now I’ve got you in the undertow Now I’ve got you in the undertow Why you wanna blame me for your troubles Ah ah ah you better learn your lesson yourself Nobody ever has to find out what’s in my mind tonight Let tonight pass us by Do you really want to be the one to fight And I said, “You’re better not to light that fire It will take you to the darkest part of the weather”What’s the matter  You hurt yourself Opened your eyes and there was someone else Now I’ve got you in the undertow Now I’ve got you in the undertow Why you wanna blame me for your troubles Ah ah ah you better learn your lesson yourself Nobody ever has to find out what’s in my mind tonight Nobody ever has to find out what’s in my mind tonight Nobody in my mind, nobody in my mind I feel it in my heart tonightYou're too much, I can't take it You always seem to make my heart stop and I can tell that there's something in your eyes Calling me I want you now I want you all over me Can't you tell me all your secrets I'll tell you all mine I'll tell you all mine Saw you all alone On the outside I knew your move Do you remember me The same way I do you I want you, open wide Can't you tell me all your secrets I'll tell you all mine I'll tell you all mine So good Soo good So good Soo good So good Soo good So good Soo goodYou come along, you come along And wash away the rain You are the sun, you are the sun That leads me back to where I belong Where I come from Because of you, I know where I belong You're a new song You're a new song, baby You're a new song to me You're a new song You're a new song, baby You're a new song to me I was, I was, I was so wrong To think, to think that it was wrong for me I want, I want it, I want it all I want, I want, I want it all so sweet You got the moves, you got the moves You got the moves, bang bang baby You got the moves, you got the moves I have never felt this strong Dancing to you all night longAll on my own Here I stand Am I humble  Am I ghost I'm on a limb to climb To something lawless I hope Am I humble  Am I ghost I'll find a way To look towards this
