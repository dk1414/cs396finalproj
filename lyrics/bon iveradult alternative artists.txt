Come on, skinny love, just last the year Pour a little salt, we were never here My my my, my my my, my my Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer I tell my love to wreck it all Cut out all the ropes and let me fall My my my, my my my, my my Right in this moment, this order's tall And I told you to be patient And I told you to be fine And I told you to be balanced And I told you to be kind And in the morning I'll be with you But it will be a different kind And I'll be holding all the tickets And you'll be owning all the fines Come on, skinny love, what happened here Suckle on the hope in light brassieres My my my, my my my, my my Sullen load is full, so slow on the split"Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me"You're laying waste to Halloween You fucked it, friend, it's on its head, it struck the street You're in Milwaukee, off your feet And at once, I knew I was not magnificent Strayed above the highway aisle Jagged vacance, thick with ice I could see for miles, miles, miles Third and Lake, it burnt away, the hallway Was where we learned to celebrate Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me That night you played me "Lip Parade"Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree Saying nothing, that's enough for me And at once, I knew I was not magnificentDown along the creek I remember something Her, the heron hurried away When first I breeched that last Sunday Low moon don the yellow road I remember something That leaving wasn't easing all that heaving in my vines And as certain it is evening 'at is N OW is not the time Toiling with your blood I remember something In B, un—rationed kissing on a night second to last Finding both your hands as second sun came past the glass And oh, I know it felt right and I had you in my grasp Oh then, how we gonna cry Cause it once might not mean something And love at second glance, it is not something that we'll need Honey, understand that I have been left here in the reeds But all I'm trying to do is get my feet out from the creaseThis my excavation and to––day is Kumran Everything that happens is from now on This is pouring rain, this is paralyzed I keep throwing it down, two––hundred at a time And it's hard to find it when you knew it When your money's gone and you're drunk as hell On your back with the racks as the stacks of your load In the back with the racks and the stacks are your load In the back with the racks and you're unstacking your load I've been twisting to the sun I needed to replace And the fountain in the front yard is rusted out All my love was down in a frozen ground There's a black crow sitting across from me His wiry legs are crossed And he's dangling my keys, he even fakes a toss Whatever could it be that has brought me to this loss Up with your turret Aren't we just terrified Shale, screen your worry From what you won't ever find Don't let it fool you Don't let it fool you Down Dancing around Folds in her gown Sea and the rock below Cocked to the undertow Bones, blood, and teeth erode With every crashing node Wings wouldn't help you Wings wouldn't help you Down Down fills the ground Gravity's proudIs the company stalling We had what we wanted: your eyes With no word from the former I'd be happy as hell if you stayed for tea This is how we grow now, woman A child ignored These will just be places to me now The foreman is down We're rising the stairs​I find God And religion, too...Staying at the Ace Hotel If the calm would allow Then I would just be floating to you now It would make me pass to let it pass on I'm climbing the dash, that skinSo apropos Saw death on a sunny snow For every life Forgo the parable Seek the light My knees are cold Running home, running home Running home, running home Go find another lover To bring a To string along With all your lies You're still very lovable I toured the light So many foreign roads For Emma, forever agoPhilosophize your figure What I have and haven't held You called and I came, stayed tall through it all Fall and fixture just the same thing Say nothing of my fable, no What on earth is left to come Who's agonized and gnawed through it all I'm underneath your tongue I'm standing in your street now, no And I carry his guitar And I can't recall it lightly at all But I know I'm going in Too much for me to pick up, no Not sure what forgiveness is We've galvanized the squall of it all I can leave behind the harbour I will run Have to crawl Along the fires One more time just pass me by I'mma make it half the night Hall light wishesI am my mother's only one It's enough I wear my garment so it shows Now you know Only love is all maroon Gluey feathers on a flume Sky is womb and she's the moon I am my mother on the wall With us all I move in water, shore to shore Nothing's more Only love is all maroon Lapping lakes like leery loons Leaving rope burns, reddish rouge Only love is all maroon Gluey feathers on a flume Sky is womb and she's the moonSharing smoke In the stair up off the hot car lot Sun shine hard on the video spot Hm, mm, mm, mm Sure as any living dream It's not all then what it seems And the whole thing's hauled away A womb An empty robe Enough You're rolling up You're holding it You're fabric now Paramind Paramind Hallucinating Claire Nor the snow shoe light or the autumns Threw the meaning out the door There's no meaning anymore
