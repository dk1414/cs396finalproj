In a dream I saw you walk Like a kid alive and talking, that was you In the classroom, you were teaching On the streets you were policing, that was you To the one I now know most I will tell them of your ghost, like a thing That never, ever was And all that ever mattered Will some day turn back to batter, like a joke Behind thin walls, you hid your feelings Takes four legs to make a ceiling, like a thing In a dream I saw you walk With your friends alive and talking, that was you Well, I saw it in your movements And even though you never knew it, well I knew How sweet it could be If you'd never left these streets You had me worried, so worried that this would last You had me worried, so worried that this would last But now I'm learning, learning that this will pass But now I'm learning, learning that this will passSo much going on these days Forget about instinct, it's not what pays Pleasure up and down my smile A carton of eggs think it's all worthwhile Tell me spirit, what has not been done I'll rush out and do it, or are we doing it now Fissure is the thrill of day Forget about feeling, that's not what pays But you know all of this can change Remember the promise as a kid you made We are the innovators, they are the imitators C'mon, hey, don't you know how we started We forgot about love, but weren't broken-heartedWaking up feeling Good and limber When the telephone it ring Was a bad man from California Telling of a stone he'd bring I'd bring And of Better days From this town We'd escape If we holler loud And make our way We'd all live One big holiday So we listened and Up the reverb And recorded all those sounds Was some shaking and some Record playing All the leather kids were loudOnly memories remain Only memories remain For a time there by the sea There was only you and me In a land that time forgot You uttered sweet forget-me-nots And you know, yeah, I never will But sometimes life has other ideas And though we both know how much it meant Now only memories remain Only memories remain Only memories remain Only memories remain, yeah yeah Only memories remain The names and places have all been changed But the identity remains the same As time and space do what they will The spirit, so vogue, can never be killed Our earthly bodies will surely fall But the love we share outlives us all What's done is done at the end of the day But still those memories remainAre we undercover  What's left to see Trying to discover how it came to be In a past life feeling loved But now in the present seeing blood And all I want to do is feel you And all I want to do is feel you And all I want to do is feel you Feel you Feel you Oh, makin' time, to waste time To feel time, oh, wash over you Ooh, watching you, watching me Reaching out between the worlds To feel you, yeah And all I want to do is feel you, yeah Are we under covers raining blood R EM covers, Reign In Blood And all I want to do is feel you And all I want to do is feel you Yeah, yeah, and all I want to do is feel you Feel you Feel you Feel youSpinning out gracefully Going nowhere quickly I am older day by day Still going back to my childhood way Circuital Round and round patiently Getting lost by the guide And I'm all worked up over nothing Circuits All running out Connect my body Deep into the ground Circuits Connect the Earth to the moon And link our heavenly bodies Not a moment too soon Well you can fling open the windows Or you can board 'em up Satan's jeweled crown Or Christ’s humble cup You think you'll find yourself out there Out in the lion’s den In some bloody battle Over belief systemsGideon, what have you told us at all Make a sound, come down off the wall Religion should appeal to the hearts of the young Who are you  What have you become Animal, come on What does this remind you of Truly, truly we have become Hated and feared for something we don't want Listen, listen Most of us believe that this is wrong Animal, come on What does this remind you of What does this remind you of Animal, come onLay low, why don't you now Lay back awhile and I'll show you I got the good that you want, no Need to go and hunt something else It's right here with me when you stay It's always good when I get to see That there's never more than what You're telling me when you stay home Lay low if the feel is right I got all that I want here in you tonight And we'll pass out on the bedroom floor After going like this so long, long Hold up, you showed me Oh, what you told me It's not what you want But what you need It's not a head full of pills Or amphetamines when you stay It's always good when I get to see That there's never more than what You're telling me when you stay homeSometimes I walk around town lookin' at faces Wonderin' why their bodies go to silly places Walkin' past carpet mills, lookin' in, takin' stills Your ass it draws me in like a Bermuda Highway Oh, don’t carve me out Don’t let your silly dreams Fall in between The crack of the bed and the wall Two times I fell asleep in a dirty basement Snoozing in cobwebs and the cement Sometimes I wonder why the meek guy got all the fame Maybe I’m to blame for his short bitter fucked-up life Oh, don’t carve me out Don’t let your silly dreams Fall in between The crack of the bed and the wallWho could see and not believe The heart that beats the wavelength And who could say but never do Things they've said to someone who Through all that's been and all will be So, in line so thoughtfully In tune with you So in time for me New thoughts arrive So in time for me Who can count the time I'm beating with my hands Who can stop the smoke from breathing in my head Words will come and words will go Make believe and overthrow Just believe and you can do You know my heart, it beats for you It beats for you, oh So in time, we beat Your thoughts align So in time with me
