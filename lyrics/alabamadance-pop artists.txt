I'm gonna take you down Deep down to the frontline Woke up this mornin', got yourself a gun Your mama always said you'd be the chosen one She said, "You're one in a million, you got to burn to shine"But you were born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes When you woke up this mornin' and all that love had gone Your papa never told you about right and wrong Hey, but you're, but you're looking good, baby I believe that you're feelin' fine, shame about it Born under a bad sign with blue moon in your eyes, so sing it now You got a blue moon So sad Goddamn A goddamn shame about it You got a blue moon Got a blue moon in your eyes, yeahA new world hangs Outside the window Beautiful and strange It must be I've fallen awake I must be Sound and color With me, for my mind And the ship shows me where to go When I needn't speak Not far now Not far now Not far now Far, far now Far, far, far, far now Far, far, far, far out Sound and color With me, in my mind Try to keep yourself awake This life ain't like it was I wanna touch a human being I want to go back to sleep Ain't life just awful strange I wish I never gave it all away No more to see the setting of the sun Life in Life in Life inBless my heart, bless my soul Didn't think I'd make it to twenty-two years old There must be someone up above Sayin', "Come on, Brittany, you got to come on up You got to hold on Hey, you got to hold on"So, bless my heart and bless yours, too I don't know where I'm gonna go Don't know what I'm gonna do There must be somebody up above Sayin', "Come on, Brittany, you got to come on up You got to hold on Hey, you got to hold on""Yeah, you gotta wait Yeah, you gotta wait"But I don't wanna wait No, I don't wanna waitI just kept hoping, I just kept hoping The way would become clear I spent all this time Try'na play nice And fight my way here See, I've been having me a real hard time But it feels so nice to know I'm gonna be alright So, I just kept dreamin', yeah, I just kept dreamin'It wa'n't very hard I spent all this time Try'na figure out why Nobody on my side See, I've been having me a real good time But it feels so nice to know I'm gonna be alright So please don't
