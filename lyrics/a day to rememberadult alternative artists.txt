And hey, darling I hope you're good tonight And I know you don't feel right when I'm leaving Yeah, I want it, but no, I don't need it Tell me something sweet to get me by'Cause I can't come back home 'til they're singing La, la la la, la la la, 'til everyone is singing If you can wait 'til I get home Then I swear to you that we can make this last, la, la If you can wait 'til I get home Then I swear, come tomorrow, this will all be in our past Well, it might be for the best And hey, sweetie Well, I need you here tonight And I know that you don't want to be leaving me Yeah, you want it, but I can't help it I just feel complete when you're by my side But I know you can't come home 'til they're singingI'm always screaming my lungs out, 'til my head starts spinning Playing my songs is the way I cope with life Won't keep my voice down Know the words I speak are the thoughts I think out loud I like to keep things honest I'm a safe bet, like your life's staked on it, for real I'd hate to keep you all wondering I'm constant, like the seasons, and I will never be forgotten, man Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken Will you even look back when you think of me All I want is a place to call my own To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone Whoa, you know to keep your Hopes up high and your head down low Keep your hopes up high and your head down low Still got something left to prove, it tends to keep things movin'While everyone around me says my last days are looming Overhead, but what the hell do they think they know My head's above the water, while they drown in the undertowResentment I need a short-term fix for a long-term problem Can I learn to love these chains I know I had a point, but now I forgot it While I'm circlin' the drain No, I can't stop feelin' like every day's exactly the same With a one-track mind I don't think I can change Trapped in memories stuck on replay, replay, replay Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire Burning me up, burning me up A dance with demons on a high wire Lift me up, lifting me up Resentment You know I lost my voice when I let the rot in Hard truth cuts both ways Pourin' out my heart all that's unforgiven Washing over me like rainNever been saved, but I've never come closer Another year down and another year older A million fresh starts, what I needed was closure, yeah I lost who I was, but I found my composure, yeah When I found you, I found me Nothin' around, far as I could see You were the current that carried me When I found you, I found me Lines in the sand only you can read My S.O.S., yeah, you rescued me Rescue me When I found you, I found me Lines in the sand only you can read My S.O.S., yeah, you rescued me Call it high-strung, started uppin' my dosage We're way too young to be feelin' this hopeless You were my light in this endless ocean, yeah Feelin' alive, even just for this moment, yeahI’m a mess, that's the best way to describe it Having no time to myself is the only way I can fight it When I'm alone it's like I'm staring into a mirror Don't know the person inside it and that's never been any clearer I miss your family and I miss all our friends If you had it to do over, would you do it over again 'Cause I would, it means something more to me There's a hole in my heart where you used to be I still wish you the best of luck, baby And don't go thinking that this was a waste of time I couldn't forget you if I tried You killed what was left of the good in me I'm tired, so let me be broken Look down at the mess that's in front of me No other words need be spoken And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried Kept all of our past mistakes held inside I’ll live with regret for my whole life I confess that I brought this all on myself Condemned to suffer alone, like there's nobody else When you're gone, it's like a whole part of me’s missing So I'll keep living the lie and just hope that you're listening I tried to make us a life here But our foundation was built on sand No time to run until the damage was done And I've never had the upper handWake up!Oh, how the times have changed!You're not the person I knew back then, let's get this straight!This is a calling, when will they stop falling for this You lack all inspiration!We're not the same I'll do whatever it takes to get it through to you, we'll call this a day We're not the same You are worthless, stay in your place!It's like speaking in tongues to all you now When will we ever Get what we deserve  How long until the tables turn  When will we ever Get what we deserve I've created a monster!You bring out a side of me that no one should see So quit stalling, pack your bags, keep walking away Your life leads to destruction I hate this town, it's so washed up And all my friends don't give a fuck Don't tell me that it's just bad luck When will I find where I fit in  Two  Three  Four!Remember when I tried I never strayed too far from you Forever by your side No matter what I was going through But now, I never know the things to say to you That help me prove that I'm still on your side I never show just what you do to me Guess I was always wrong I hate this town, it's so washed up And all my friends don't give a fuck Don't tell me that it's just bad luck When will I find where I fit in I hate this town'Cause no one can understand I just can't be tied down Nothing comes between me and my plansExpect the worst of everyone I meet Count the clock 'cause I can't fucking sleep Shooting pain like a heart attack Call my friends, I might not make it back The doctor says I'm headed for destruction Something's gotta give I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head Paranoia clouding your judgement And no matter what you do 'bout it, 'bout it, 'bout it I'm still in your head It's got me scared, scared of the unknown Unknown numbers been blowing up my phone I'm hearing footsteps outside of my house I'm afraid someone's trying to take me out The doctor says I'm headed for destruction Can I fucking live Dada dada dada, dada, da da da dada, dada Dadada dadada dada, dada, dada, dada Let's go!It's not easy making a name for yourself Where do you draw the line I never thought I'd be in this far Let's have some fun and never change up for anyone Try not to miss me when I'm gone Woah, oh, woah, oh I sold my soul to the open road I'll live my life alone!You won't find me in the same spot, believe me I could never stop, my life's turned upside down Meet me out past the train tracks, I'm leaving And not coming back, you're right, and I was wrong This town will be the downfall of us all I'm gonna need you to try to follow along I did the best that I could to try to write you songs Now go tell them we sold out, like we're the ones who changed I write what I feel, I say what I mean, you can't buy sincerityDon't blink, they won't even miss you at all And don't think that I'll always be gone You know, I've got you like a puppet in the palm of my hand Don't you let me down!So, run like hell Sleep with one eye open, I can't forgive or forget you We'll tell everyone the damage done Deep down, you can't stop me, you can't stop me now!I'll be there just to watch you fall So, don't push me, I've got nothing to lose Don't blink, they won't even miss you at all And don't think that I'll always be gone You know, I've got you like a puppet in the palm of my hand Don't you let me down!Here I go again I made it so damn hard to come back from the mess that you're in I need you to know, I told you so You're a snake and I'm cautious, just use your head
