Feeling my way through the darkness Guided by a beating heart I can't tell where the journey will end But I know where to start They tell me I'm too young to understand They say I'm caught up in a dream Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes Well that's fine by me So wake me up when it's all over When I'm wiser and I'm older All this time I was finding myself And I didn't know﻿ I was lost So wake me up when it's all over When I'm wiser and I'm older All this time I was finding myself And I didn't know ﻿I was lost I tried carrying the weight of the world But I only have two hands I hope I get the chance to travel the world But I don't have any plans Wish that I could stay forever this young Not afraid to close my eyes Life's a game﻿ made for everyone And love is the prizeHey, brother There's an endless road to rediscover Hey, sister Know the water's sweet but blood is thicker Oh, if the sky comes falling down For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do Hey, brother Do you still believe in one another Hey, sister Do you still believe in love I wonder Oh, if the sky comes falling down For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do What if I'm far from home Oh brother, I will hear you call What if I lose it all Oh sister, I will help you out Oh, if the sky comes falling down For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't doWhere there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful And every night has its day, so magical And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle That can't be defeated For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable In every lost soul the bones of a miracle For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable With something to believe in Monday left me broken Tuesday I was through with hopin'Wednesday my empty arms were open Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love Thank the stars it's Friday I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday I'll be waiting for love Waiting for love to come around We are one of a kind, irreplaceable How did I get so blind and so cynical If there's love in this life we're unstoppable No, we can't be defeated Once upon a younger year When all our shadows disappeared The animals inside came out to play Hey, went face to face with all our fears Learned our lessons through the tears Made memories we knew would never fade One day my father he told me"Son, don't let it slip away"He took me in his arms, I heard him say "When you get older Your wild heart will live for younger days Think of me if ever you're afraid"He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind So live a life you will remember"My father told me when I was just a child"These are the nights that never die"My father told meYou said that we would always be Without you I feel lost at sea Through the darkness you'd hide with me Like the wind we'd be wild and free You said you'd follow me anywhere But your eyes tell me you won't be there I've gotta learn how to love without you I've gotta carry my cross without you Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to Figure it out without you And I'm done sitting home without you Fuck, I'm going out without you I'm gonna tear this city down without you I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you Now I'm running away, my dear From myself and the truth I fear My heart is beating I can't see clear How I'm wishing that you were hereCan you hear me  S.O.S.Help me put my mind to rest Two times clean again, I'm actin' low A pound of weed and a bag of blow I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers We could be more than just part-time lovers We could be more than just part-time lovers I get robbed of all my sleep As my thoughts begin to bleed I'd let go, but I don't know how Yeah, I don't know how, but I need you now I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time loversIt's you and your world and I'm caught in the middle I caught the edge of a knife and it hurts just a little And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know that I can't be your friend It's my head or my heart, and I'm caught in the middle My hands are tied, but not tight enough You're the high that I can't give up Oh lord, here we go I might hate myself tomorrow But I'm on my way tonight At the bottom of a bottle You're the poison in the wine And I know I can't change you, and I I won't change I might hate myself tomorrow But I'm on my way tonight Let's be lonely together A little less lonely togetherI don't know just how it happened; I let down my guard Swore I'd never fall in love again, but I fell hard Guess I should have seen it coming; caught me by surprise Wasn't looking where I was going; I fell into your arms You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing rain Before I, I knew what hit me, baby, you were flowing through my veins I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue Out of control, what can I do I'm addicted to you Midnight blows in through the window, dances 'round the room Got me hypnotised, I'm getting high on the perfume I couldn't live without you now, oh, I know I'd go insane I wouldn't last one night alone, baby I couldn't stand the pain I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue Out of control, what can I do I'm﻿ addicted to youYou stripped your love down to the wire Fire shy and cold alone outside You stripped it right down to the wire But I see you behind those tired eyes Now as you wade through shadows that live in your heart You'll find the light that leads home Cause I see you for you and your beautiful scars So take my hand, don't let go Cause it's not too late, it's not too late I, I see the hope in your heart And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting Broken arrows in the dark But I, I see the hope in your heart I've seen the darkness in the light The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind The only thing that's black and white Is that you don't have to walk alone this time We have to tear down walls that live in your heart To find someone you call home Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars So take my hand, don't let goPaint on a caution wind'Neath the bleeding sky I called your name There was no one there And in the cold and snow I saw your face And we sang the song for the little thing Magic calm, but the joy you bring Running it down the line Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing Magic gone from a pretty thing Maybe it might be time For a better day For a better day For a better day Straight, from the path of love In the road of life I tumble forward But going on, I'mma keep it strong I saw your face
