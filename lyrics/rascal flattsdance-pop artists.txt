Woo Hmm, yeah Life's like a road that you travel on When there's one day here and the next day gone Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand Sometimes you turn your back to the wind There's a world outside every darkened door Where blues won't haunt you anymore Where the brave are free and lovers soar Come ride with me to the distant shore We won't hesitate To break down the garden gate There's not much time left today, yeah Life is a highway I wanna ride it all night long If you're goin' my way I wanna drive it all night long Through all these cities and all these towns It's in my blood and it's all around I love you now like I loved you then This is the road and these are the hands From Mozambique to those Memphis nights The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights Knock me down, I'm back up again You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely manI set out on a narrow way many years ago Hoping I would find true love along the broken road But I got lost a time or two Wiped my brow and kept pushing through I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you That every long lost dream led me to where you are Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars Pointing me on my way into your loving arms This much I know is true That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you I think about the years I spent just passing through I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you But you just smile and take my hand You've been there, you understand It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true Every long lost dream led me to where you are Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars Pointing me on my way into your loving arms This much I know is true That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you, ooh YeahI can take the rain on the roof of this empty house That don’t bother me I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay But that’s not what gets me What hurts the most Was being so close And havin' so much to say And watchin' you walk away And never knowing What could've been And not seein' that love in you Is what I was tryin’ to do It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go But I’m doin’ It It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone Still harder Gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin’ with this regret But I know if I could do it over I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart That I left unspokenI hope that the days come easy and the moments pass slow And each road leads you where you wanna go And if you're faced with a choice and you have to choose I hope you choose the one that means the most to you And if one door opens to another door closed I hope you keep on walkin' 'till you find the window If it's cold outside, show the world the warmth of your smile But more than anything, more than anything My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small You never need to carry more than you can hold And while you're out there getting where you're getting to I hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things, too Yeah, this is my wish I hope you never look back, but you never forget All the ones who love you and the place you left I hope you always forgive and you never regret And you help somebody every chance you get Oh, you'd find God's grace in every mistake And always give more than you take But more than anything, yeah, more than anythingThere's one more sip in this bottle of wine A lonely star hangin' in the sky with a wish left on it And it's yours if you want it And this wildflower from the neighbor's yard A real slow dance in the moonlight dark This hand in my pocket Oh baby, just call it Cause it's yours if you want it And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart That's been waitin' on a girl like you I know it ain't much But it comes alive with every touch Every kiss already feels like you own it Baby, it's yours if you want it Half of this rickety front porch swing Every word of every song I sing My jacket when it's cold Oh baby, don't you know You've got a place to lay your head On the other side of my empty bed And it's just made for fallin'And it's yours if you want it It's yours if you want itShe got that "hey y'all" little southern drawl that she got from her mama Likes coffee with her sugar in the morning She likes to leave little red lipstick love notes on the mirror Loves the rain on a tin roof when it's pouring Doesn't matter what we're listening to Spinning her around the living room And I fall apart every time She puts that beat in my chest Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes She brings me back to life Yes, she does She's got her feet on the dash Hair blowing back, hand out the window Making up half the words that she's singing And she takes an hour to pick a  movie out Five minutes in and she's passing out And I wouldn't dare wake her up when she's sleepingHey baby, is that you Wow, your hair got so long Yeah, yeah, I love it, I really do"Norma Jean", ain't that the song we'd sing in the car Driving downtown, top down, making the rounds Checking out the bands on Doheeney Avenue Yeah, life throws you curves But you learned to swerve Me, I swung and I missed and the next thing ya know I'm reminiscing Dreaming old dreams, wishing old wishes Like you would be back again I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain I put on that old song we danced to and then I head off to my job Guess not much has changed Punch the clock, head for home Check the phone, just in case Go to bed, dream of you That's what I'm doing these days Yeah, that's what I'm doing Someone told me after college, you ran off to Vegas You married a rodeo cowboy Wow, that ain't the girl I knew Me, I've been a few places Mostly here and there, once or twice Still sortin' out life, but I'm doing alright Yeah, it's good to see you too Well, hey girl, you're late And those planes, they don't wait But if you ever come back around this sleepy old town Promise me you'll stop in to see an old friend And until then.. It's like a storm That cuts a path It breaks your will It feels like that You think you're lost But you're not lost On your own You're not alone I will stand by you I will help you through When you've done all you can do And you can't cope I will dry your eyes I will fight your fight I will hold you tight And I won't let go It hurts my heart To see you cry I know it's dark This part of life Oh, it finds us all And we're too small To stop the rain Oh, but when it rainsSprayed my name on a water tower Carved it in an old cottonwood tree Signed a bunch of high school yearbooks So they wouldn't forget about me It wasn't 'til I saw my daddy's name in stone I knew It ain't a question of if they will It's how they remember you Did you stand or did you fall Build a bridge or build a wall Hide your love or give it all What did you do  What did you do Did you make 'em laugh or make 'em cry Did you quit or did you try Live your dreams or let 'em die What did you choose  What did you choose When it all comes down It ain't if, it's how they remember you When you're down to your last dollar Will you give or will you take When the stiff wind blows the hardest Will you bend or will you break  You're gonna leave a legacy, no matter what you do It ain't a question of if they will It's how they remember youWe broke up, yeah, it's tough Most guys would've been crushed Wasting their time Wondering where they went wrong No way, not me Hey, I'm doing just fine I'm not afraid of moving on It's easy going out on a Friday night Easy every time I see her out I can smile, live it up The way a single guy does But what she, what she don't know Is how hard it is to make it look so Easy The truth is I miss Lying in those arms of his But I don't ever let it show I laugh and I act Like I'm having the time of my life As far as he knows
