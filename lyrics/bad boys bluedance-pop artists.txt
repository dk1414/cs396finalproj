gone to How can broken hearts find their way back home When nobody cares about you, and you're feeling blue Come back and stay Don't keep me waiting, baby Come back and stay Don't say goodbye; don't let my love die Come back and stay and try again Don't walk away for I'm still your man Where are you now Where did you go Come back and stay Don't keep me waiting I'll miss you so Walk in the rain Thinking about the game I play I am to blame I lost my lovin' yesterdayThe bright light of the boulevard Is shining in your tender eyes Your perfume is exciting me It's still the same Michelle, how I love when we love And I love when you whisper je t'aime Michelle, mon amour  Is it true Do you feel the way I do A world without you, a world on my own Without your love my heart will turn to stone A world without you, a day without light Without your touch I couldn't stand one night Oh Michelle I know there'll be no better heart No better heart to hold on to If you should ever let me down I can't survive Michelle, how I love when we love And I love when you whisper je t'aime Michelle, mon amour  Is it true Do you feel the way I do A world without you, a world on my own Without your love my heart will turn to stone A world without you, a day without light Without your touch I couldn't stand one night Oh Michelle C'est toi  Et ce soir je te veux faire l'amour avec toi  Je t'aime  Je sais mon amour que tu es que tout, le seul pour moi A world without you, a world on my own Without your love my heart will turn to stone A world without you A world without you Oh MichelleThis other place and so far from home I was alone  I was all on my own The moon was shining I saw her face The magic woman all dressed in lace She gave me a sigh And I followed her to a house of light Somewhere in the night Behind the window, symbols of red Painting the face of the lady in black Behind the window, I'll never forget The magic lady, the lady in black She'll never come back The lady's beauty was so divine She took my heart with her heavenly smile When I reached down just to kiss her hand I suddenly tumbled down in the sand There was broken lace lying on the ground And the house of light was fading in the night Behind the window, symbols of red Painting the face of the lady in black Behind the window, I'll never forget The magic lady, the lady in blackMy love, now you're lying lonesome With visions of blue, visioning you Again, you let your heart go, when-Whenever you do, it's hurting me too When damage is done I watch you run It's me you call, to me you come Kisses and tears, my one and only Don't be lonely, I'm right here Kisses and tears, we'll turn that bad dream To a good thing, it's so clear Kisses and tears, a new world's waiting That we're creating with our love Kisses and tears, my one and only Don't be lonely, don't you run You know how a heartache ends With visions of blue abandoning you I know that we're more than friends, you-You know that it's true, it's long overdueLittle lady You're my music You're my favorite song Little lady Like to play Through the night on and on And I know how to go slowly to the bottom of your soul Gimme, Gimme, Gimme Your Lovin'Give me vibration and sweet inspiration Oh, Gimme, Gimme, Gimme Your Lovin'Don't keep me waiting, forever Little lady give me more Give me more of your love and magical healing So little lady keep me warm in your arms tonight Little lady  You're my ocean Let my boat sail along Little lady  Something tender Through my heavenly home Take your time  Time for devotion Lay your body next to mineThey're talking in the neighborhood About a sexy hips  O W!She looks a bit like Hollywood Wait till you hear her lips He's from the other side of town But in the hungry streets They say he's just
