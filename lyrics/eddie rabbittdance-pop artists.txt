Well, I love a rainy night I love a rainy night I love to hear the thunder Watch the lightning When it lights up the sky You know it makes me feel good Well, I love a rainy night It's such a beautiful sight I love to feel the rain On my face Taste the rain on my lips In the moonlight shadow Showers washed All my cares away I wake up to a sunny day'Cause I love a rainy night Yeah, I love a rainy night Well, I love a rainy night Well, I love a rainy night Ooh-ooh I love a rainy night I love a rainy night I love to hear the thunder Watch the lightning When it lights up the sky You know it makes me feel goodWell, the midnight headlight blind you on a rainy night Steep grade up ahead, slow me down, makin' no time But I gotta keep rollin'Those windshield wipers slappin' out a tempo Keepin' perfect rhythm with the song on the radio But I gotta keep rollin'Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away Lookin' for a better way for me Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away Lookin' for a sunny day Well, the truck stop cutie comin' on to me Tried to talk me into a ride, said I wouldn't be sorry But she was just a baby Hey, waitress, pour me another cup of coffee Pop it down, jack me up, shoot me out, flyin' down the highway Lookin' for the mornin'Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away Lookin' for a better way for me Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away Lookin' for a sunny day Well, the midnight headlight blind you on a rainy night Steep grade up ahead, slow me down, makin' no time But I gotta keep rollin'Those windshield wipers slappin' out a tempo Keepin' perfect rhythm with the song on the radio But I gotta keep rollin'It'd be a lie to say that I'm not gonna miss you So please don't say goodbye now Till I've kissed you one more time And held you as I did when you were mine It'd be a lie to say I don't still love you I won't be thinking of you, girl I'll never try to call you one more time Or try to find a way to change your mind Ooh, you don't love me anymore Oh, baby You don't love me anymore Baby, please forgive me But the wine's gone to my head And tomorrow I'll remember how you turned to me and said It'd be a lie to say that I still love you That I'll be thinking of you, boy I'll drive by to say hello sometime Oh, but now you're gone And all I have are five words on my mindI've always been the kind of man Who doesn't believe in strings Long term obligations are just unnecessary things But girl, ya got me thinkin'While I'm drinkin' one more beer If I'm headed for a heartache Then why the hell am I still here I'm testin' my resistance And it's wearin' mighty thin I've got the feelin' I should leave Before the roof caves in My mind tells me to move along But my body begs me stay And now I feel the need to hold you close And love the night away While you're turnin' me Every which way but loose You turn me Every which way but loose Inside the fire's burnin' me In my mind you just keep turnin' me Every which but loose Baby there's no excuse To turn me every which way but looseJust you and I Sharing our love together And I know in time We'll build the dreams we treasure We'll be all right, just you and I Just you and I Just you and I Sharing our love together And I know in time And I know in time We'll build the dreams we treasure And we'll be all right Just you and I And I remember our first embrace That smile that was on your face The promises that we made And now your love is my reward And I love you even more Than I ever did before Just you and I Just you and I We can entrust each other With you in my life With you in my life They'll never be another We'll be all right Just you and II’m laughing on the outside, I’m crying on the inside Trying my best to hide all these tears in my eyes I’m laughing on the outside but I’m dying on the inside Baby when you said goodbye, I put my heartache in disguise Saw my friends on the street They’re all asking me how I’m taking it I act like nothing’s wrong I don’t let on, I’m good at faking it But just how long can I keep up this masquerade You know it’s just a saccharine I’m laughing on the outside but I’m crying on the inside Trying my best to hide all the pain I feel inside I’m laughing on the outside but I’m dying on the inside Baby when you said goodbye, I put my heartache in disguise But how does the heartache last How much do you pay for love How long will I wear this mask How long can I keep it up Laughing on the outside, crying on the inside Trying my best to hide all these tears in my eyes I’m laughing on the outside but I’m dying on the inside Baby when you said goodbye, I put my heartache in disguiseAll of my life I’ll give you all of my love This I promise to you, I will be true Near or apart, you’re always here in my heart You were meant to be the only one for me All my life I’m

There's nothing in this world we couldn't beWell, I know a place where love comes easy And I know a woman who meets me there She takes my hand, and gently leads me And we go up to the room at the top of the stairs I close the door and she pulls the curtain When we make love, it's a private affair I've been around and I know for certain There ain't no room like the room at the top of the stairs When we climb up the stairway to heaven We find love waiting there Right at home, oh, just me and my baby The loving's good in the room at the top of the stairs When we climb up the stairway to heaven We find love waiting there Right at home, just me and my baby The loving's good in the room at the top of the stairs Yeah, I know a place where love comes easy And I know a woman who meets me there She takes my hand, and gently leads me And we go up to the room at the top of the stairs'Cause the loving's good in the room at the top of the stairsI came in here to have a good time With nothing particular on my mind When I saw you sitting there by yourself Why don’t we put a nickel in the old jukebox Yeah, come on baby, I’ll dance off your socks Cause you sure look like you need a friend
