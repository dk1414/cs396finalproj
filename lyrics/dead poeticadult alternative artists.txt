These are the words that tear you apart And these are the words that take you away And these are just words, they'll tear you apart When no one here will say what needs to say New medicines should ease this pain They're the only ailment for it It's this air and time that's bringing me home again A lame attempt at playing the part again now In a place you don't know And this stance as sturdy as leaves in a storm The premise and motive fueling blank faces The fool in a place you don't know In this place, you don't New medicines should ease this pain They're the only ailment for it All over again New medicines should ease this pain They're the only ailment for it All over againSo after all, you needed more than a death-threat fall You needed more, and I let you fall Into the coffin with your floor-dropped jaw And I remember you aspiration, your dream to fit in But it's gone, and they're here So let's kill these felons now But I remember you, you'll go, you'll find a way back home But I remember you, when you stand there You stand with your eyes closed And I feel, tonight, that I let you die But you could have lived forever, it took smiles to keep you alive But heroes die, and so did mine But you go, and I stay, will it keep you at peace now But I remember you, you'll go, you'll find a way back home But I remember you, when you stand there You stand with your eyes closed You stand with your eyes closed You stand with your eyes closedI don't want to come back here, to this place It's a cold that only comes from blaming yourself for two decades wasted And I don't want to come back here, to this place When it all just repeats in my head again, and I cannot stop it And the glass in the trees, and all you left here Reflects everything that I missed And the pavement is still warm from the tires I can still feel the fright that the night brings Every song that you'd sing And I won't ever come back here to this place All I ever do is picture you smiling, and then picture you leaving And the glass in the trees, and all you left here Reflects everything that I missed Slow down I'll try and make it up to you They've cut down the trees to try to forget you But I took a vow to never forget you If you're still here, then we're waiting We'll wait for you to come back home to the broken little foes Until the guilt grows and grows When the time that's wasted comes back to haunt me And I'll deserve every bit  because I'm not spiritual yet I'm just reading the lines they gave me from the pulpit And it's not fading off, we remember the years As we sift through the laughter to find all the tears And I'm not worthy of grievance, I did nothing to prevent this And standing at your grave, I could have caused thisLet it burn in your eyes Your cover is blown this time, and you knew You knew this was gonna happen, you could taste the red hands And like the flies You'll eat the worst of everything And you knew this was gonna happen, you could taste the red hands But you needed this, you needed this You needed this You needed this There's a glossary of dirty words for people just like you And only For people like you, I reserve the words:Backstabbers and money whores And dirty rotten millionaires That always wanted more Pull the wool on my eyes Like a crooked, burnt-out saint I believed and soaked in every word you said Always tasting red hands But the fight Never ended and we're all here Singing loud for revolution, and sitting battles outYou sold your soul for an ounce of attention Gaining the world and demanding affection Will you ever be pleased with your own skin Will you ever refuse what they're asking You can't hide your insecurities with a pretty face Breed it, and bear it, and make it your narcotic Begging face down on the floor Breed it, and bear it, and make it your narcotic You sold your soul, now they want more Vanity's gun left you dead in Hollywood Empty, addicted, and screaming for comfort From a world devoid of compassion Exchanging hopes for rejection You can't hide your insecurities with a pretty face Breed it, and bear it, and make it your narcotic Begging face down on the floor Breed it, and bear it, and make it your narcotic You sold your soul, now they want more Breed it, and bear it, and make it your narcotic Begging face down on the floor Breed it, and bear it, and make it your narcotic You sold your soul, now they want moreAnd If I could teach the world to be..I'd teach them all to be something just like me Frustrated, bitter, depressing Perfect...As if my wings were like yours But I'm falling down And if you could hold your tongue long enough..You'd see that all I am is love, but I don't like me I despise me Perfect...As if my wings were like yours But I'm falling down Perfect...As if my wings were like yours But I'm falling down It's a disease they'll never have a cure for You're the only way to dry my eyes It's a disease, they'll never have a cure But I'm the one whose wrong I'm the one who cries It's a disease, they'll never have a cure for It's a disease, they'll never have a cure But I'm the one whose wrong I'm the one who criesBury all the differences between us When I still can't find the air You keep the toxins flowing for me And I'll bury all the differences between us And I still can't help but care for moving mountains But your, your head's held high again You will find me out You will find everything We all, we just battle ourselves We just battle ourselves again We all, we just battle ourselves We just battle ourselves again Bury all the differences between us, that same mechanic sound That keeps on ringing for days and days And you're standing like a clueless titan falls And everything around falls right down on you With your head, with your head held high again You will find me out You will find everything You will find me out You will find everythingDo we have the time to lay the line between true life, and you in mine I want to reel it back before the day when simplicity was washed away Like modern morbid prophecies fulfilled Like biting on these bitter tasting pills And we're just heroes, And we're just heroes For the day There's a silent urge to leave this cloud when all I want is to hear the sound Of your voice devoid of the constant noise, the only sound to fill this void And do you want this  And do you still need this Like modern morbid prophecies fulfilled Like biting on these bitter tasting pills And we're just heroes, And we're just heroes They all won't love me, she won't let me forget Like modern morbid prophecies fulfilled Like biting on these bitter tasting pills And we're just heroes, And we're just heroes Don't make me choose, I'll choose you and this will all be overPaint the lines on perfect eyes that circle the object of My sincere affection, my undivided attention Lie where you won't see yourself in that way And we'll ride to somewhere All we are is paralyzed from the face down We're still alive with our fake smiles When the camera's away Don't remember this  No, don't remember this We are losing it all, but we are gaining the world with our hands tied Your arms placed upon mine And the sky looks so right, and you're mine tonight Lie where you won't see yourself in that way And we'll ride...All we are is paralyzed from the face down We're still alive with our fake smiles When the camera's awaySometimes it seems as if the rain won't stop  Skies falling down in flames Sometimes I think that the rain won't stop, and we're caught up in foolish games A tear falls down amongst the clouds, as you weep in fear and pain A bridge to cross, an obstacle found  My face bleeding from this rain And all the time you see my eyes with a spark of new beginning So sorrowful as the temper flies, a maze, your world of sinning And all the haters fail to see The path where true love dwells And all the things you hoped you'd be may burn with the flames of hell Dirty, filthy from the thoughts inside, the shame painted in red on your face Bitter with the ties to the lies, eyes wide since I had that taste If you were me and I were you, never having this confrontation I'd strive to realize and find out why you don't carry out the proclamation In my shoes I've seen the best  But the filth along the way The drugs, the sex, and all the rest, still remains loud present day But my eyes grow weary quick, searching for light inside Crying, your tears so thick  buckle up, come along for the ride CH OR US Lightening strikes and I close my eyes tight For the vision of you in this deep, dark night Battered hard with the worlds filthy offerings Blood -bathed with his wrists as the angels sing Sick, fed up with this day to day life Trying to proclaim, let them see Your light Disappoint in my quarters, all alone A bright light, stop the press, hold the phone Your wide palm of love, descend from above Your love, truth, Lord, what dreams is made of Lead the path, pull the wool from my eyes Such a black, such a pity, my disguise My eyes tempted, but permanently lifted Check out the Son because his light I see so vivid Your love, your truth, Lord, all I
