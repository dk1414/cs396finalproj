I've never seen a diamond in the flesh I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies And I'm not proud of my address In a torn-up town, no postcode envy But every song's like Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair And we'll never be royals It don't run in our blood That kind of luxe just ain't for us We crave a different kind of buzz Let me be your ruler You can call me queen bee And baby, I'll rule Let me live that fantasyWait till you're announced We've not yet lost all our graces The hounds will stay in chains Look upon Your Greatness and she'll Send the call out, send the call out Send the call out, send the call out Send the call out, send the call out Send the call out, send the call out Send the call out, send the call out Send the call out, send the call out Send the call out, send the call out Send the call out, send the call out Call all the ladies out They're in their finery A hundred jewels on throats A hundred jewels between teeth Now bring my boys in Their skin in craters like the moon The moon we love like a brother While he glows through the room Dancin' around the lies we tell Dancin' around big eyes, as well Even the comatose They don't dance and tellI do my makeup in somebody else's car We order different drinks at the same bars I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar Well, those great whites, they have big teeth Hope they bite you Thought you said that you would always be in love But you're not in love no more Did it frighten you How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor On the light up floor But I hear sounds in my mind Brand new sounds in my mind But honey, I'll be seein' you 'ever I go But honey, I'll be seein' you down every road I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it'Cause honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want itGo for it One, two Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi He don't wanna know me Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm Says it was poison So I guess I'll go home Into the arms of the girl that I love The only love I haven't screwed up She's so hard to please, but she's a forest fire I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance We slow dance in the living room But all that a stranger would see Is one girl swaying alone, stroking a cheek They say, "You're a little much for me You're a liability You're a little much for me"So they pull back, make other plans I understand, I'm a liability Get you wild, make you leave I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyoneThe drink you spilt all over me"Lover's Spit" left on repeat My mum and dad let me stay home It drives you crazy, getting old We can talk it so good We can make it so divine We can talk it good How you wish it would be all the time The drink you spilt all over me"Lover's Spit" left on repeat My mum and dad let me stay home It drives you crazy, getting old The drink you spilt all over me"Lover's Spit" left on repeat My mum and dad let me stay home It drives you crazy, getting old This dream isn't feeling sweet We're reeling through the midnight streets And I've never felt more alone It feels so scary, getting oldDon't you think that it's Boring how people talk Making smart with their words again Well, I'm bored Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it Never not chasin' a million things I want And I am Only as young as the minute is, full of it Getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought But I know they'll never own me Baby, be the class clown I'll be the beauty queen in tears It's a new art form Showin' people how little we care We're so happy Even when we're smilin' out of fear Let's go down to the tennis court And talk it up like, "Yeah" Pretty soon, I'll be getting On my first plane I'll see the veins of my city Like they do in space But my head's Fillin' up fast with the wicked games, up in flames How can I fuck with the fun again when I'm Known And my Boys trip me up with their heads again, lovin' them Everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne But I know it's not forever Go back and tell it Please, could you be tender And I will sit close to you Let's give it a minute before we admit that we're through Guess this is the winter Our bodies are young and blue I'm at Jungle City, it's late and this song is for you'Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost Well, I guess I should go, yeah, I guess I should go Hard feelings These are what they call hard feelings of love When sweet words and fevers All leave us right here in the cold, oh, oh Alone with the hard feelings of love God, I wish I believed ya When you told me this was my home, oh, ohWell, summer slipped us underneath her tongue Our days and nights are perfumed with obsession Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough I overthink your p-punctuation use Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do A rush at the beginning I get caught up, just for a minute But lover, you're the one to blame All that you're doing Can you hear the violence Megaphone to my chest Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom And make 'em all dance to it Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom And make 'em all dance to it Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom And make 'em all dance to it Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom And make 'em all dance to it Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom And make 'em all dance to itI hate the winter, can't stand the cold I tend to cancel all the plans But when the heat comes, something takes a hold Can I kick it  Yeah, I can My cheeks in high colour, overripe peaches No shirt, no shoes, only my features My boy behind me, he's taking pictures Lead the boys and girls onto the beaches Come one, come all, I'll tell you my secrets I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus Forget all of thе tears that you've cried It's ovеr It's a new state of mind Are you coming, my baby Acid green, aquamarine The girls are dancing in the sand And I throw my cellular device in the water Can you reach me  No, you can't Every night, I live and die Feel the party to my bones Watch the wasters blow the speakers Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light It's just another graceless night I hate the headlines and the weather I'm nineteen and I'm on fire But when we're dancing, I'm alright It's just another graceless night Are you lost enough Have another drink, get lost in us This is how we get notorious, oh'Cause I don't know If they keep tellin' me where to go I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh-oh-oh All of the things we're taking'Cause we are young and we're ashamed Send us to perfect places All of our heroes fading Now I can't stand to be alone Let's go to perfect places
