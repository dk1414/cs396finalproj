City lights graced interstates The way you move your hands Through your hair when you feel alone Through your hair when you feel alone Remember the flowers you picked When we crossed over Madison You were so sure you found yourself That you branded it into an oak The one you swore reached through the sky And swallowed the city line You had yet to hit twenty-three An age that would swallow you Then, every breath made you confess You did not know what to do with your hands This is a new side of you So full of fearOh no  I thought you'd changed Take back all the things you said I remember thinking this evidence You left was damning enough But you took all the words from my mouth And pulled them out How could I not see you For what you are But you turned all the words from my mouth Into doubt And I wish I could tear your heart out!Break meter and release, and still the voice it keeps And I wish that your lungs would give out And finally give air to breathe But I know better now No words can weed you out When your back's against the wall You'll be crying out I'll take all the words from your mouth And leave them out And your hands are shaking Finally, call out!And the silence breaks your heart Finally Oh, I almost pity you now, I almost pity you now Finally, call out!Oh, I almost pity you nowIn fall, the year you grew to be six feet I tempered my fear into haste A worry that dogged our mother She, the baby of three, asked how So many things could take flight at once There are no easy answers, and even at thirteen I could not think of a sure reply At the church where I was baptized Our father refused to park near the crowd At that time, I still believed in god, or faeries Or that the air could catch on fire When you and your friends took off on separate routes I wanted to follow you But our mother said I was not allowed to You had not yet learned how to fill such a broad frame That winter you said you hated your body But when spring came, you'd learned how to speak And you moved out west To watch the ocean eat the coast away I can still remember that day you left Thoughts spilling out from my chest Like, "who will you be when you come back "Or even, "will you come back "Will all my twenties find me so guarded Lettered and documented by meticulous word choice and closed lips To read like:All things bear this-A purpose  or romance!But the truth is much more complicated than that And i am still trying to learn how time is a giftYou settled into uneasy sleep A subtle hint that things were changing And every breath of labored rest Brought new designs of old regrets and How they aged you!How they took your strength away!When they entered your body And pinned fear to weight Pull out  Pull out  Lead your weak cells to oxygen And sew your skin to bone You can hold on  Hold on  Lend dead weight to stronger hands You are not alone, you are not alone If you're weighed down I'll lay your fears to rest You are safe now You are safe nowOn a late spring day, when summer began to take shape You lowered your head to bear an uneven compromise How your voice held steel, make sharp by the sound of it aloud!You were drunk on each syllable; you could not even hear what it sang When you were young You spent your summers in Maine And stripped of the friends you made You gorged yourself on Frost and Hemingway When you came back to Michigan You would walk with words you did not speak And dress yourself With an air we couldn't reach So when you go back to Maine, I hope that you stay Where you have cornered truth and beauty And each borrowed refrain you sing, you sing, you sing Will sound the same to the lonely, lonely seaThe long days piled into weeks before you'd speak As the storm crawled to meet the shoreline And it began to rain at once!I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried To keep the awful things at bay from you But it was on the air and useless, I Might as well have tried to prove the words I fought to purchase would comfort you Like, "there was nothing more that we could do"Or that I still loved you When nothing could be further from the truth Will your hand fall out of mine Your shame lives on its own, trying to reach The depths down where it belongs Will it find rest in your bones Aching and pulling muscles to act out against you, so Stay your pity now If it reaches the heart, we all pull out And let the beat slow down There's nothing that we can do you for now Are you sorry, or are you just scared There will be no false comfort here Oh, I ought to tell you the truth!I did not come to plea for you Where was your heart when your words led the truth Anywhere else from you You're not sorry, you are just scared I have not come to calm your fearsWill the same mistakes haunt you like they used to do Or are you afraid that your body won't let you choose You are your father's son And the same disease that holds you held him once And I know if you push this hard it will still take hold You cannot accept the things you can't control And I know your mind is young but your body's old And you can't forgive yourself, though no one else could blame you for this But hold on!Hold on!Hold on!And already I can't remember if the heart was ever aware That the body it kept alive was wearing out, was shutting down And tonight, when it realized, you gave up, it cried out"Only now I realize I always knew , I alwas knew""Only now I realize I always knew , I alwas knew"I nearly lost you on our wedding day It was early afternoon And you were leaving from lunch with your best friend When your vehicle careened Into an S UV as it turned out in front of you Violently flinging you into the waiting airbag You were shaken and dazed, but otherwise okay And still determined to get married And I watched you walking down the aisle, you were glowing The scrapes and bruises only made you more beautifulCity lights graced interstates The way you move your hands Through your hair when you feel alone Through your hair when you feel alone Remember the flowers you picked When we crossed over Madison You were so sure you found yourself That you branded it into an oak The one you swore reached through the sky And swallowed the city line You had yet to hit twenty-three An age that would swallow you Then, every breath made you confess You did not know what to do with your hands This is a new side of you So full of fear
