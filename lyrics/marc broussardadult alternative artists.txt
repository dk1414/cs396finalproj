Rolling down the road Going no where Guitar packed in the trunk Somewhere round mile marker 112 Papa started hummin the funk I gotta jones in my bones before we know We were singing this melody Stop the car pulled out the guitar Halfway to New Orleans Said take me home Take me home Could feel the sun about to rise When I realized we had nothing to fear It's just me and my daddy and a kid named Cope Making music that nobody would hear And then the sun let up and it split the night Spilling over our jubilee Ten thousand cars by the side of the road Grooving far as the eye can see Said take me home Take me home Said take me home Said take me homeWhen your baby Leaves you all alone And nobody Calls you on the phone Don't you feel like crying Don't you feel like crying Here I am, honey Come on, cry to me When you're all alone In your lonely room And there's nothing But the smell of her perfume Don't you feel like crying Don't you feel like crying Don't you feel like crying Come on, come on, cry to me Whoa, nothing can be sadder Than a glass of wine alone Loneliness, loneliness Just a waste of time, oh yeah You don't ever have to walk alone Oh, you see Come on, take my hand Baby, won't you walk with me Oh yeahThey say a man ain't supposed to cry But I can't seem to stop these tears It's too hard living life without a friend To help me smile If my tears could bring you back to me I'd gladly cry a thousand years Thinking 'bout the feel I get to see your face And say, old friend I'm happy to see you again These walls are not the same Sunny, you have gone and changed You've changed it all I'm so tired of the pain I would live as good as explaining the pain Carry it all I don't know why But I know I miss you That's why they say a man ain't supposed to cry But I can't seem to stop these tears It's too hard living life without a friend To help me smile If my tears could bring you back to me I'd gladly cry a thousand years Thinking 'bout the feel I get to see your face And say, old friend I'm happy to see you againOne sweet surprise at my door You are no dream like I had before But you cry and I'm not sure Why you've come here I don't have much to give to you What I say will sure be true What I will do is drive every tear And if you know how I feel And if you believe my love's for real Real enough to touch And draw near Then reach out and hold me close And in time, you will know That I will drive every tear My friends all say I move too slow Well, I guess that's just how I go Well, I know that I loved you For so many years Oh, and there's so much to hold inside That some nights, alone, I cry With no one to drive every tearOh, tell me what's on your mind Cause I'm hoping all you need is some time You're leaving or so you say Well, I'm not so sure how things turned out this way And I hope you know I'll never put you down And when the times get hard don't to hesitate to turn around Cause I'll, I'll leave a light on You're never too far gone Where ever your heart leads you to roam I'll leave a light on Strangers don't know your name They don't care where you're going or from where you came Though angels may lose their way But I don't have the wings to fly away And I hope you know I'll never put you down And when the times get hard don't to hesitate to turn around Cause I'll, I'll leave a light on You're never too far gone Where ever your heart leads you to roam I'll leave a light on Tell me what's on your mind Was it everything you hoped that you would find You're still running, but I can see That the road you're on is leading back to meOh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling From glen to glen and down the mountainside The summer's gone and all the roses falling It's you, it's you must go and I must bide But come ye back when summer's in the meadow Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy, I love you so Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes, they are calling From glen to glen and down the mountainside The summеr's gone and all the roses falling It's you, it's you must go and I must bidе Yet come ye back when summer's in the meadow Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy, I love you so And I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy, I love you soI said if I If I don't see ya soon Baby, I might just go crazy See, another night Here in this lonely room Without your body next to mine It makes me suffer, baby Barely alive Burnin' fever love Until I See your face I'm a dyin' man With every breath That weakens me I fear it might be my very last If I don't feel Your tender love Well, I don't think this fever's gonna pass Ain't tryin' to scare you, girl Just want you to know I always loved ya baby, in case I go Until I See your face I'm a dyin' manI think it's a miracle That you're layin' here, right by my side Someone so beautiful Long brown hair and your pretty green eyes Maybe I've done something along the way Sure seems someone's smiling down on me And I'll never have to look for love again So lucky I found you So happy I'm with you And honey I know that there's no mistakin' I'm better with you And I'm grateful, grateful, grateful I got lucky with you Sometimes it takes a while And other times it comes naturally But I took one look at you I knew that you were meant for me You know that I'm not gonna walk away Be here tomorrow just like today And I'll never have to look for love again So lucky I found you So happy I'm with you Oh baby I know, there's no mistakin' I'm better with you And I'm grateful, grateful, grateful I got lucky with youTake her to heart She'll always love you And nobody Can make her do wrong Take her for granted Leaving love unshown Makes willpower weak And temptation strong A woman's only human You should understand She's not just a plaything She's flesh and blood just like her man If you want a do-right-all-days woman You got to be a do-right-all-night man Yeah, yeah, they say that it's a man's world But you can't prove that by me And as long as we're together, baby Show some respect for meThere's never a good time to find the words to say But the last thing you and I need together is another day So before we hurt anymore, I'll be on my way'Cause the last thing you and I need together is another day Another day, to tell us what we've known To sow the seeds we've sown Would it make a difference Another day, to try and right the wrongs When we've known all along We can't make up the distance Honey, we'll never know what's in store If all we're living for is another day Living lies knowing all of the time, you were not the one Trying to force a love with a stranger, when we should have run So many hours in silence, nothing to talk about Both looking for an easy way to say: I just want out Another day, to tell us what we've known To sow the seeds we've sown Would it make a difference Another day, to try and right the wrongs When we've known all along We can't make up the distance Darling, we'll never know what's in store If all we're living for is another day
