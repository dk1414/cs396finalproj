Sometimes you're better off dead There's a gun in your hand, and it's pointing at your head You think you're mad, too unstable Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables In a restaurant in a West End town Call the police, there's a madman around Running down underground to a dive bar In a West End town In a West End town, a dead end world The East End boys and West End girls In a West End town, a dead end world The East End boys and West End girls West End girls Too many shadows, whispering voices Faces on posters, too many choices If, when, why, what How much have you got Have you got it, do you get it, if so, how often And which do you choose, a hard or soft option "Twenty seconds and counting T minus fifteen seconds, guidance is internal"When I look back upon my life It's always with a sense of shame I've always been the one to blame For everything I long to do No matter when or where or who Has one thing in common, too It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin It's a sin Everything I've ever done Everything I ever do Every place I've ever been Everywhere I'm going to It's a sin At school they taught me how to be So pure in thought and word and deed They didn't quite succeed For everything I long to do No matter when or where or who Has one thing in common, tooI've got the brains, you've got the looks Let's make lots of money You've got the brawn, I've got the brains Let's

studied at the Sorbonne Doctored in mathematics I could have been a don I can program a computer Choose the perfect time If you've got the inclination I have got the crimeCome on, come on, come on,

get through I bought you drinks, I brought you flowers I read your books and talked for hours Every day, so many drinks Such pretty flowers, so tell me What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this What have I, what have I, what have I Since you went away, I've been hanging around I've been wondering why I'm feeling down You

what have I done to deserve this I came across a cache of old photos And invitations to teenage parties"Dress in white," one said with quotations From someone's wife, a famous writer In the 1920s When you're young, you find inspiration In anyone who's ever gone And opened up a closing door She said, "We were never feeling bored'Cause we were never being boring We had too much time to find for ourselves And we were never being boring We dressed up and fought, then thought, "Make amends"And we were never holding back or worried that Time would come to an end"When I went, I left from the station With a haversack and some trepidation Someone said, "If you're not careful You'll have nothing left and nothing to care for In the 1970s"But I sat back and looking forward My shoes were high and I had scored I'd bolted through a closing door I would never find myself feeling bored'Cause we were never being boring We had too much time to find for ourselves And we were never being boring We dressed up and fought, then thought, "Make amends"And we were never holding back or worried that Time would come to an end We were always hoping that, looking back You could always rely on a friend Now I sit with different faces In rented rooms and foreign places All the people I was kissing Some are here and some are missing In the 1990s I never dreamt that I would get to be The creature that I always meant to be But I thought in spite of dreams You'd be sitting somewhere here with meMaybe I didn't treat you Quite as good as I should Maybe I didn't love you Quite as often as I could Little things I should have said and done I never took the time You were always on my mind You were always on my mind Maybe I didn't hold you All those lonely lonely times And I guess I never told you I'm so happy that you're mine If I made you feel second best I'm so sorry I was blind You were always on my mind You were always on my mindI don't know why, I don't know how I thought I loved you, but I'm not sure now I've seen you look at strangers too many times The love you want is of a different kind Remember when we felt the sun A love like paradise, how hot it burned A threat of distant thunder, the sky was red And when you walked, you always turned every head Watch them all fall down Domino dancing Watch them all fall downLost in the high street, where the dogs run Roaming suburban boys Mother's got her hairdo to be done She says they're too old for toys Stood by the bus stop with a felt pen In this suburban Hell And in the distance a police car To break the suburban spell Let's take a ride and run with the dogs tonight In suburbia You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight In suburbia Break the window by the town hall Listen, a siren screams There in the distance like a roll call Of all the suburban dreams Let's take a ride and run with the dogs tonight In suburbia You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight In suburbiaLet's get out of this life I'm afraid and alone Paralysed in the purple zone My time goes so slow And I don't know how the show will end I'm losing all my feeling Emotion I pretend So let's get out of this life I'm afraid and alone Paralysed in the purple zone Let's get out of this life I'm afraid and alone Paralysed in the purple zone Paralysed in the purple zone All the fleeting moments of beauty You blinked and then they were gone Now you're sitting there wondering Just where it all went wrong No glory, no glamour, too many confusions Colouring all my delusions Paralysed in the purple zone
