Been a while since I felt this way about someone I'd really, really like to know you more, know you more Oh, your eyes they sing a song to me And I'd really, really like to move to it, oh, groove, oh And I will open my heart And I will only for you Oh, your eyes spinning 'round my head And, oh, this light is on, ooh, yeah, on, ooh, yeah Oh, your eyes spinning 'round my head And, oh, this light is on, ooh, yeah, on, ooh And I will, oh, ah And I will only for you And I just don't know what to do My head has such a cloudy view I'm so tired of trying, ooh And I just don't know what to do My head has such a cloudy view I'm so tired of trying, oohAll you feel and you taste And you wanna go higher so what do you do And so you peek into the mountain where your desire goes Spilled blood on this place It only echoes true all through the days And so you peek into the mountain where your desire goes Oh, havin' the space to know The weight is coming down Take it on down the line Oh, yeah, havin' the space to know The weight is coming down Take it on down the line It's hard to get ahead when the center is bleedin'And you tear out the middle and you send it all away Tasteless lead sittin’ on our tongues And then we have to worry more about the ones we love When you see the smoke, there's fire When you see the smoke, there's fire When you see the smoke, there's fire When you see the smoke, there's fire Oh, havin' the space to know The weight is coming down Take it on down the line Oh, yeah, havin' the space to know The weight is coming down Take it on down the lineMy heart has drifted out into a place I cannot find And the days go by searching all the time I was searching all, searching all the time I looked into the eyes, the eyes of everyone I know And the days go by wondering where to go I was searching all, searching all the time I tell myself these bitter, these bitter days will end You gotta, you just gotta let 'em go And just let go So I stumble and I sway into the room, I fade And I hope my darkest days will be behind me I want to stay out here in the sun a while And I hope my darkest days will be behind me Oh for way too long, these things, they occupy my mind And the things that I, things I left behind Oh, I was searching all, searching all the time Oh my my my these bitter, these bitter days will end You gotta, you just gotta let them go And just let go So I stumble and I sway into the room, I fade And I hope my darkest days will be behind me I want to stay out here in the sun a while And I saw, I saw the wide world, wide old worldI've made a lot of choices Most have not been wise But I have some really good friends I have been fortunate enough to find They get me through the lonely days When I want to stay inside myself Get me out of my shell Out into the world I am a-comin' back, I'm comin' back again I had lost everything and then I got it back again I dug myself so deep, deep into a hole That getting out was so far beyond my control In the past, I've always had trouble on my mind I'm gonna take that feelin' and leave it far behind And as I go down this path, travelin' through my fate Lately I have begun to awake It started out in Jackson and we moved across the land And all the dehydration turned the soil into sand And then one day, they hauled me away And I was out there, out on my own And the thieves, they came and went They took everything in sight And then we got it back again Oh, I had to fightSometimes a silence seems so loud to me And I'm thinkin' out loud and I'm tryin' to keep Too much reflection isn't healthy for me Present and future is where I need to be But I'm stallin' this story I'm gonna fill it with glory'Cause there's no place to go but up And I'm changin' my outlook'Cause lookin' inwards Isn't always a good place to go And I hold my head now With a tear in my eye'Cause I don't really care no more Always so little things That eat at your soul And I'm not gon' worry about them no more I came a long way Came a long way Came a long way Came a long way Day by day, livin' this way, I'm gonna carry on I'm, I'm takin' my time Gonna do things just right I'm gonna carry on, oh, ohAnd the wind, it tore all through the atmosphere And the air, it filled with dust Searching for a connection, I went in every direction Some places I've already been And, oh, with lost love and loneliness So many things have changed And, oh, I just don't look at things the same way now Since we parted ways Out in this space, I'm a long way from home The hum of the wheels, they are carrying me on To a wide open space to breathe in, oh I needed a wide open place to breathe in, oh And the sun went down over this little ghost town Near the valley of the Rio Grande I needed a little bit of whiskey and a little bit of time To ease my troubled mind And, oh, with lost love and loneliness So many things have changed And, oh, I just don't look at things the same way now Since we parted waysStaring out at the city skylights A marathon is going down the street And we're all racing for our own reasons And sometimes in the middle, we all meet On this long race home On this long race home Came into another fork in the road That's where we decided to part And no one said anything for hours We were under the same familiar stars On this long road home On this long road home And we all want to belong To something more than, more than ourselves'Cause you can't always do it alone Sometimes you just need, need a little helpWell, I left my home and started to roam A new beginning here out on my own I'm feeling the sun so warm on my skin Things are turning around again For a long time, I've been on the mend And I don't need no more medicine I'm filled up with hope, my future is bright Give me some sunshine, give me some shine Coming round the mend, coming round the mend Waited so long, waiting so long I'm getting used to being alone I'm getting used to out on my own For a long while, I thought I would break But now I know that it just takes a while I was low low low low low low low low low Low low low low low low low low low low Low low low low low low low low low low Low low low low low low low low low low And I open my arms out, open wide And I swallow my fears I cannot hide And it's been such a long time And it's been such a long time Down round, around the bendAll these places part of me It fills me up and swallows me My emotions wrapped in vines Are reaching for the sun that shines Oh, I must say I adore ya But sometimes I seem to ignore ya That's because I don't deserve ya Have your love for me ever All this time, I wanted you to know That if you're ever, ever feeling low You can always count on, on me To be there whenever you need Since you took my breath again Would you share your oxygen I can breathe one breath of air Intoxicated by your stare Standin' in the middle of the street Oh, please don't run over me I've been tryin', tryin' to finally Reach for a sun that shinesIf I ask you to stay, would you hold me in your arms What a beautiful thing this could be, oh, woah And I'd risk my heart breaking just to see where this could lead What else am I gonna do but wonder my days through You never know unless you let yourself see You never know unless you open up your eyes You never know until you do You never know until you do On this beautiful morning, oh, there's a light in your eyes And I don't know why sometimes, it makes me want to run and hide But I'm getting a little older, getting a little bolder Gеtting a little wiser, getting a littlе brighter Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
