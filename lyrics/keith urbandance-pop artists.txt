up on a couch sun-rise Saw the living room Through these bloodshot eyes of mine, cold sober You didn’t like that I came home late4 A M but it's a Friday, babe And I've been working hard Can't you give me some space 'stead of shouting out, "Oh my God"?Oh-oh, ooh-yeah Oh-oh, ooh-yeah I go out with some new friends But it just makes me miss you more, more I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong I know I'm proud But I've had one too many Come take me homeYou said "I love you" to me And I don't know what that means So I froze on my feet People use it so carelessly And I couldn’t believe That you would dive in so deep And you said perfectly Everything I’ve been feelin' about you It’s time to break the chains that held me back from you So come on and Take a little bit of my Heart tonight No, I literally don't mind Just please don't misplace it Take a little bit of my Heart tonight No, baby be mine now Baby, be mine now Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line Well I was never the type To put it all on the line But I've been changing my mind since you opened my eyes It was the way that the light Picked you out of that night Then you were right by my side Put a soul in my body And now it’s time to close the space between the two of usI hit the highway and I checked the time I see the sunrise and it makes me wanna change my mind Oh I got it bad I stopped for coffee in a no where town A pretty waitress says, hey what's the frown Boy you've got it bad Well so many times you told me before If I don't like it, well there's the door This time I've gone for good and I got it bad I got it badder than a broken heart Badder than the Devil's smile And I can't face bein' apart I guess I'll have to leave but meanwhile Oohh I got it bad Moonlight on the water still looks the same Pretty girl beside me but I don't know her name Guess I got it bad I'm too weak to say no, too lonely to care I'll believe her if she says hey baby I got love to spare Well tomorrow I'll take it like a man Tonight I'm takin' all I can This time I went for good and I got it badThere'll be days your heart don't wanna beat You pray more than you breathe And you just wanna fall to pieces And nights, those 2 A M calls Where dreams become walls And you just need a break Break on me Shatter like glass Come apart in my hands Take as long as it takes, girl Break on me Put your head on my chest Let me help you forget When your heart needs to break Just break on me There'll be times when someone you know Becomes someone you knew But you'd do anything to change it And words you wanna take back But you know you can't When the page just won't turn And it still hurts Break on meLet me carry your burden If somethin' ain’t right, I will let you know Like the paint that's drying on a heart that's broke Let me carry your burden I’ll get you back on a high when you're feeling low When the weight's too heavy, but you won't let go Come to me, my brother, and I will sit with you awhile Pretty soon, I'll see you smile and you know you will No matter how much you're hurting right now You know that everything will change in time So let me carry your burden Let me carry your burden When your mouth's on fire, but your mind is cold And you're fanning flames that won’t keep you warm Come to me, my brother, and I will sit with you a while Pretty soon, I’ll see you smile and you know you will No matter how much you're hurting right now You know that everything will change in time Let me carry your burden, oh brother of mine
