In the suburbs, I I learned to drive And you told me we'd never survive Grab your mother's keys, we're leaving You always seemed so sure That one day we'd be fighting in a suburban war Your part of town against mine I saw you standing on the opposite shore But by the time the first bombs fell We were already bored We were already, already bored Sometimes I can't believe it I'm moving past the feeling Sometimes I can't believe it I'm moving past the feeling again The kids want to be so hard But in my dreams, we're still screaming And running through the yard And all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall And all of the houses they built in the seventies finally fall Meant nothing at all Meant nothing at all, it meant nothingTrapped in a prison, in a prism of light Alone in the darkness, darkness of white We fell in love, alone on a stage In the reflective age Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts If this is heaven I don't know what it’s for If I can’t find you there I don't care I thought I found a way to enter It’s just a Reflektor I thought I found the connector But it’s just a Reflektor Now, the signals we send, are deflected again We're so connected, but are we even friends We fell in love when I was nineteen And now we're staring at a screenTake the makeup Off your eyes I've got to see you Hear your sacred sighs Before the break up Comes the silence I'm talking to you You say you're over it But I know I thought I knew you You thought you knew me But now that you do It's not so easy now That I know You can cry, I won't go You can scream, I won't go Every man that you know Would have run at the word go Little boys with their porno Oh, I know they hurt you so They don't know that we know Never know what we knowAfterlife, oh my God, what an awful word After all the breath, and the dirt, and the fires are burnt And after all this time, and after all the ambulances go And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on to the dead light Of the afterglow I've gotta know Can we work it out We scream and shout ‘til we work it out Can we just work it out Scream and shout ‘til we work it out ‘Til we work it out, ‘til we work it out‘Til we work it out, ‘tilwe work it out Afterlife, I think I saw what happens next Oh, it was just a glimpse of you, like looking through a window Or a shallow sea Could you see me And after all this time It's like nothing else we used to know And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on to the dead light Of the afterglow I've gotta knowSomething filled up My heart with nothing Someone told me not to cry But now that I'm older My heart's colder And I can see that it's a lie Children, wake up Hold your mistake up Before they turn the summer into dust If the children don't grow up Our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up We're just a million little gods causing rain storms Turning every good thing to rust I guess we'll just have to adjust With my lightning bolts a-glowing I can see where I am going to be When the reaper he reaches and touches my hand With my lightning bolts a-glowing I can see where I am going With my lightning bolts a-glowing I can see where I am go-going You better look out below Every inch of sky's got a star And every inch of skin's got a scar I guess that you've got everything now And every inch of space in your head Is filled up with the things that you read I guess that you've got everything now And every film that you've ever seen Fills the spaces up in your dreams That reminds me Everything now!Everything now!Every inch of road's got a sign And every boy uses the same line I pledge allegiance to everything now And every song that I've ever heard Is playing at the same time, it's absurd And it reminds me, we've got everything now We turn the speakers up 'til they break'Cause every time you smile, it's a fake Stop pretending, you've got everything now Some boys hate themselves Spend their lives resenting their fathers Some girls hate their bodies Stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback Saying God, make me famous If You can't, just make it painless Just make it painless Assisted suicide She dreams about dying all the time She told me she came so close Filled up the bathtub and put on our first record God, make me famous If You can't, just make it painless Just make it painless It goes on and on, I don't know what I want On and on, I don't know if I want it On and on, I don't know what I want On and on, I don't know if I want itThey're walking around, head full of sound Acting like we don't exist They walk in the room and stare right through you Talking like we don't exist But we exist Daddy it's true, I'm different from you But tell me why they treat me like this If you turned away, what would I say Not the first betrayed by a kiss Maybe it's true, they're staring at you When you walk in the room Tell 'em it's fine, stare if you like Just let us through, just let us through They're down on their knees, begging us please Praying that we don't exist Daddy it's fine, I'm used to 'em now But tell me why they treat me like this It's ‘cause we do it like this Maybe it's true, they're staring at you When you walk in the room Tell 'em it's fine, stare if you like Just let us through, just let us throughAnd if the snow buries my My neighborhood And if my parents are crying Then I'll dig a tunnel from my window to yours Yeah, a tunnel from my window to yours You climb out the chimney and meet me in the middle The middle of the town And since there's no one else around, we let our hair grow long And forget all we used to know Then our skin gets thicker from living out in the snow You change all the lead, sleeping in my head As the day grows dim, I hear you sing a golden hymn Then we tried to name our babies but we forgot all the names that...The names we used to know But sometimes we remember our bedrooms and our parent's bedrooms And the bedrooms of our friends Then we think of our parents, well, what ever happened to them You change all the lead, sleeping in my head to gold As the day grows dim, I hear you sing a golden hymn It’s the song I’ve been trying to singHey, Orpheus!I'm behind you Don't turn around I can find you Just wait until it's over Wait until it's through And if I call for you Oh, Orpheus!Just sing for me all night We'll wait until it's over Wait until it's through You say it's not me, it's you Hey, Orpheus!De l'autre côté de l'eau Comme un écho Just wait until it's over Wait until it's through And if I shout for you Never doubt Don't turn around too soon Just wait until it's over Wait until it's through
