I saw it open There's a  we can't hear Some newfound fashion Just the latest insult craze Trying to wake up from these days We're waiting We're waiting Here it comes, now Pretty mouth and greener eyes Can't forget to see your selfish light Because it feels good Well, that doesn't make it right Trying to wake up from the sight We're waiting We're waiting Where would you go and get changed Since you're lost, I'm bathed in your words There's so much more you could fake Since you're lost, I'm bathed in your words So now it's real good And you're a beggar on the stage Found my way through all the mess that you made For everything that it's worth now Trying to wake up gets you downToday I found a nickel And I held it in my hand I wished it lots of luck as I Gave it to the homeless man He said God bless you I said God bless us both He smiled and started laughing I guess I told a joke Here and now Ready and willing Touch my heart it is open Kiss my soul if you're willing I am ready to be living Here and now Today I had a notion I had To call up my old friend She said she had a Poem for me And did I hear that She was thinking of leaving I said I will miss you And then I played her my new song We laughed and cried We never said goodbye And when I called again She was gone Here and now Ready and willing Touch my heart it is open Kiss my soul if you're willing I am ready to be living Here and now Today I made a dollar and I'm feeling very rich I earned it with my labor Yes I dug my ditch I'm free from all my worries And I cast away my doubts I am living in this moment And tomorrow's gonna Work itself out Here and now Ready and willing Touch my heart it is open Kiss my soul if you're willing I am ready to be living Here and nowMy strings beats upon the chest My chest beats upon the heart My heart beats upon the blood My blood doesn't flow to my brain I can tell because I'm getting cold I haven't lived and I'm feeling old And when I talked to her she said no My brain beats upon the pillow My pillow beats upon the bed My bed beats upon the ocean As she drifts away from me As I float into the sea As she is fading into the light As day turns into nightI saw it open There's a  we can't hear Some newfound fashion Just the latest insult craze Trying to wake up from these days We're waiting We're waiting Here it comes, now Pretty mouth and greener eyes Can't forget to see your selfish light Because it feels good Well, that doesn't make it right Trying to wake up from the sight We're waiting We're waiting Where would you go and get changed Since you're
