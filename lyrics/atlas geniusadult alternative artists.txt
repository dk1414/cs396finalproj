Take it off, take it in Take off all the thoughts of what we've been Take a look, hesitate Take a picture you could never recreate Write a song, make a note For the lump that sits inside your throat Change the locks, change the scene Change it all, but can't change what we've been Oh, oh Your Trojan's in my head Oh, oh Your Trojan's in my head Your Trojan's in my head It's okay if it's gone The thoughts that you had that it was the one And, oh, what is left For all those times, is that what you get Oh, regardless The walls get painted anyway Oh, you're guarding The gates, but it all got awayWe steal the molecules from the dead We liberate inanimate objects Is this a path of will up ahead Or are we just destined to get what we get Drawn to your face like never before Even the mistakes aren't really mistakes at all I wanna confess that you own me And we don't rest if we're lonely There's innocence in the moment Maybe now's the time to be alive We steal the molecules from the dead We liberate inanimate objects Is this a sign of will in our heads Or are we predestined to get what we get Drawn to your face like never before Even the mistakes aren't really mistakes at allWon a moment, lost a bet Saw a mountain, went to bed Paid a ransom for a ghost For the thing I want the most So I left to find a home For a place to call my own Even if you think we're not We're close to close enough It's an end to end the start We're moving from the ground floor Rising tide Push us up more How we climb As the water's pouring in Like it always should have been We can crawl or we can run Towards the sun Take it all, I'll keep the rest Burn the wheels and pound your chestNow I'm packing to leave you for 63 days And you think I won't miss you in six million ways And the time of your life, spent wondering why I don't call when I promise to Ooh, in the doorway I told you I would race Home when you need me In for the long chase I'll make you believe I told you I would race Home when you need me In for the long chase I'll make you believe Now I know what you need 'cause our fears are the same If we shake down the pretense, it's all a parade'Cause I'm still by your side I'm still wondering why I don't call when I promise to Ooh, in the doorway I told you I would race Home when you need me In for the long chase I'll make you believe I told you I would race Home when you need me In for the long chase I'll make you believeIf there is one, then there's the rest Those who belong and then the guests We've been safe inside what once was the frontier Take a moment to remember that you were here Hold the remote control Across the battle line below Commander wants you on the phone The E TA is drawing close We're losing height but holding on Soft as we can land We're coming in low And way too fast So there is one and there's the rest We're never lost but indirect I wouldn't raise alarm just yet Although we're hanging by a thread Tied to what we might get Hold the remote control Across the battle line below Commander wants you on the phone The E TA is drawing close We're losing height but holding onEverybody's taking what they can But they can't decide And they do what they want to Cause any kind of feeling's alright And don't be talking maybe Your mama's flying high as a kite You're just like the next one Cause we'll be walking lonely tonight Lonely tonight If so, if so We know, we'll be coming If so, if so We know, we'll be coming If so, if so We know, we'll be coming Everyone's faking like they can It makes it alright Tell me what you want to Cause I don't know the wrong from the rightCold backstreet A flicker of a light that I couldn't meet Olfactory Senses breaking down, slowly figures it'd be Old back seat Drunken couple take it too far thinking no one could see Having sex on the street I'll sell you a feeling Oh, whoa I'll sell you a meaning Oh, whoa I'll sell you a feeling Oh, whoa I'll sell you a meaning Oh, whoa Use that door Words like knives that no longer cut The world in flames So small anymore we could fall through the grate We've got time Gonna waste it all, gonna be fine We're complicated But we're as simple as we wanted to beWe were meant to die We were suicide You and I There's bitter in your sweetest Dirty white little lies We give, we take We all imitate We come, we fake We love ’til we hate We give, we take We all imitate We come, we fake We break Tell me you'll stay Whatever it takes Can't be alone tonight Love’s a mistake Everything breaks Can't be alone tonightThere's always time to start over again'Cause if we're done with this, all of this Let's wash away everything that we've been I know you're done with this, all of this It's time to hit the ground So let it fall, and watch it break into shards Of light and gold, a perfect end All eyes fixated on new dreams, cascading Yeah, we got stuck in between The act and just what we need So rally up, gather round It's time to hit the ground So let it fall, and watch it break into shards Of light and gold, a perfect end All eyes fixated on new dreams, cascading It all starts again, cascading Ah, don't wait We'll get it right this time Ah, don't wait We've all been up for daysA heart drops as you motion towards It's not how it's supposed to be And it all moves into one Slow burn the devotion We took turns as stars fell over And it all moves into one The outcome is pseudo bliss Turn hours, somehow, into years And it all rolled into one Moment of these second thoughts Centred on you My conscience all lit up With second thoughts Centred on you Should we all wait up Should we all wait up Should we all wait up Should we all wait up A heart drops as you motion towards It's not how it's supposed to be And it all moves into one
