Full of despair, inside a darkness Self conscious and scared, held prisoner of war Running out of air, buried in a sadness Want a way out of this paralyzing world And the sound of the cries when a family's loved one dies It echoes through a vacant room where a young soul still resides When the night is cold and you feel like no one knows What it's like to be the only one buried in this hole You can make it to the sunrise You can make it to the sunrise Searching for a way to escape the madness A dire need for change as we fight for better days The hurt and the pain cut deep like a razor blade Holding in a cry for love, abandoned and afraid When the night is cold and you feel like no one knows What it's like to be the only one buried in this hole You can make it to the sunrise You can make it to the sunrise When I was lost I was searching for someone to be the light to follow through the dark No one was there I promise you when you're lost, I will save you I wanna be the one to lead you through the dark I'll never leave you I promise you won't be alone Looking back at it, I should've fallen apart I can tell you the story of how I've got these scars I was young, all alone, heart turning to stone No attention, no love, all I heard was "Hold on"It felt more than I can handle I never learned, I never learned from example When I was lost, I was searching for someone to be the light to follow through the dark No one was there I promise you when you're lost, I will save you I wanna be the one to lead you through the dark I'll never leave you I promise you won't be alone I promise you won't be aloneYou're my white tiger Captivated by a perfect view Time stopped and I found my muse Brighter than the morning sun Flames burned until the night was done My faith in love was born again From the clouds you were heaven sent I could tell you were a different breed From the way you looked at me And there's no place that I'd rather be When I feel your teeth sink into me I bleed a color that I've never seen A beauty that makes me complete You're my white tiger, my white tiger The first time I saw you standing there Butterflies, all I could do was stare So flawless and original My heart dropped and I fell for you Everything I was looking for Like a wave crashing on my shore Suddenly I couldn't speak It's like an angel walked into meI know we both want to do the right thing But the needle in our compass is trembling Trapped in the flames as our house burns down Left for dead cause we can't find common ground We can't find common ground so we agree to burn it down We can't let it burn down so we need to find common ground It's so hard to find the truth When the other side wants to bury you, to bury you It's so hard to find the way When the other side wants to play you like a game It's all about who's wrong and who's right Don't wanna learn, we just just wanna fight If different thinkers are enemies Just think of what we could be if our thoughts were in harmony I know we both want to do the right thing But the needle in our compass is trembling Trapped in the flames as our house burns down Left for dead cause we can't find common groundOpen your eyes and it'll make it easier to fight through The dark times, the dark times Hold the light and it'll make it easier to shine through The dark times, the dark times I remember a time when I was young and blind Couldn't take the fall for anything at all I blamed it on everybody else Like the New World Order, the Illuminati, as long as it wasn't me I was afraid of the mirror, of what I would see I didn't wanna see me Open your eyes and it'll make it easier to fight through The dark times, the dark times Hold the light and it'll make it easier to shine through The dark times, the dark times If the sky is always raining black If the world is always stabbing you in the back Open your eyes and you will find that we all live broken lives We all live broken lives I was envious of other peoples love Hung up on why I didn't have their lives I blamed it on everybody else, I blamed it on everybody Like corrupt politicians or the shitty economy As long as it wasn't me One day I lifted my head and looked into the mirror I was staring at meYou've got both ears on me Constantly analyzing Waiting for me to misspeak through Selective hearing Dissected nouns and verbs Every single sound's been searched This is not what I deserve Is it fun to watch me burn Holding my head to the curb Lighting the match with my words This is not what I deserve Is it fun to watch me burn I better watch what I say With pitchforks and torches ablaze You can't wait to turn the world against me I better watch what I say Before you tarnish my name You won't stop until you've got my tongue tied with lies You've got my tongue tiedI've been on the low I been taking my time I feel like I'm out of my mind It feel like my life ain't mine Who can relate I've been on the low I been taking my time I feel like I'm out of my mind It feel like my life ain't mine I don't wanna be alive I don't wanna be alive I just wanna die today I just wanna die I don't wanna be alive I don't wanna be alive I just wanna die And let me tell you why All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it I'm hurting deep down but can’t show it I never had a place to call my own I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone Where you been  Where you at  What's on your mind They say every life precious but nobody care about mineI've been fighting the same old war Against a disease, without a cure Been holding on for so long I've been wishing upon a star, as my universe falls apart I feel so far from the sky, as my dreams are flying by And they say it's a battle that can't be won We need our knives, we need our guns Should I run away and change my name Or should I stay and fight through the night And never close my eyes I'll never close my eyes I've come too far to go back now, to turn into a face in the crowd Been on this road, for so long Convinced there is no way out, my world is turned upside down My sense of direction's been gone And they say it's a battle that can't be won We need our knives, we need our gunsNobody pray for me Even a day for me Waaaaay I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances Finesse a fella with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin' this Parmesan where my accountant lives; in fact, I'm downin’ this D'U SSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods I get way too petty once you let me do the extras Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris A.M  to the P.M., P.M  to the A.M., funk Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk If I quit your B M, I still ride Mercedes, funk If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk My left stroke just went viral Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note It's levels to it, you and I know Bitch, be humble Sit down Be humble Sit down Be humble Bitch, sit down Be humble Sit down Be humble Sit down Be humble Sit down and e humble Bitch, sit down Be humble Sit downShould we believe that human beings are just material things Destined to grasp every little bit of happiness But without a purpose, do we truly know what we are good for Do our philosophies make sense when we truly test them I'm more than just a ghost in the machine Not just a hollow vessel aimlessly sailing It's not easy to believe what our eyes can't see But I am more than just a ghost in the machine Can we battle a crisis of the conscience alone Life is a guilt trip, it was built in to a system that we live with We can't seem to escape it So we worship our idols and expect them to save us I'm more than just a ghost in the machine Not just a hollow vessel aimlessly sailing It's not easy to believe what our eyes can't see But I am more than just a ghost in the machine I can not be explained, no I am no coincidence Take me apart and put me back together again I can not be explained, no I am no coincidence Take me apart and put me back together again
