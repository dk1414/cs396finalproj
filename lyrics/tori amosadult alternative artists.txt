Never was a cornflake girl Thought that was a good solution Hanging with the raisin girls She's gone to the other side Giving us a yo-heave-ho Things are getting kind of gross And I go at sleepy time This is not really, this, a-this This is not really happening You bet your life it is You bet your life it is Oh honey, you bet your life It's a peel out the watchword Just peel out the watchword She knows what's going on Seems we got a cheaper feel now All the sweeteaze are gone Gone to the other side With my encyclopedia They musta paid her a nice price She's putting on her string bean loveSnow can wait, I forgot my mittens Wipe my nose, get my new boots on I get a little warm in my heart when I think of winter I put my hand in my father's glove I run off where the drifts get deeper Sleeping beauty trips me with a frown I hear a voice: "You must learn to stand up For yourself, cause I can't always be around"He says:"When you gonna make up your mind When you gonna love you as much as I do When you gonna make up your mind 'Cause things are gonna change so fast All the white horses are still in bed I tell you that I'll always want you near You say that things change, my dear"Boys get discovered as winter melts Flowers competing for the sun Years go by and I'm here still waiting Withering where some snowman was Mirror mirror, where's the crystal palace But I only can see myself Skating around the truth who I am But I know that the ice is getting thinSlag pit, stag shit Honey bring it close to my lips, yes Don't blow those brains yet We gotta be big, boy, we gotta be big Starfucker just like my daddy, yes Starfucker just like my daddy, yes Selling his baby, yes Just like my daddy, yes Gonna strike a deal Make him feel like a congressman Running in the family It's running a family Rest your shoulders, peaches and cream Everywhere a Judas as far as you can see Beautiful angel calling We got every re-run of Muhammad Ali Prism perfect Honey bring it close to your lips, yes What is termed a landslide of principle proportion, boy It's gotta be big, I said it better be big, hey, heyOh honey bring it close to my Oh honey bring it close to my lips, yeah Oh honey

said it's gotta be big It's gotta be big I said it's gotta be big It's gotta be big I said it's gotta be big It's gotta be big I saidOn my way up north, up on the Ventura I pulled back the hood and I was talking to you And I knew then it would be a lifelong thing But I didn't know that we, we could break a silver lining And I'm so sad like a good book I can't put this day back A sorta fairytale with you A sorta fairytale with you Things you said that day, up on the 101 The girl had come undone, I tried to downplay it With a bet about us, you said that you'd take it As long as I could, I could not erase it And I'm so sad like a good book I can't put this day back A sorta fairytale with you A sorta fairytale with you And I ride alongside And I rode alongside you then And I rode alongside till you lost me there in the open road And I rode alongside till the honey spread itself so thin For me to break your bread, for me to take your word I had to steal itExcuse me, but can I be you for a while My dog won't bite if you sit real still I got the Antichrist in the kitchen yelling at me again Yeah, I can hear that Been saved again by the garbage truck I got something to say, you know but nothing comes Yes I know what you think of me, you never shut up Yeah, I can hear that But what if I'm a mermaid In these jeans of his with her name still on it Hey, but I don't care cause sometimes I said sometimes I hear my voice, and it's been Here, silent all these years So you found a girl who thinks really deep thoughts What's so amazing about really deep thoughts Boy, you best pray that I bleed real soon How's that thought for you My scream got lost in a paper cup You think there's a heaven where some screams have gone I got 25 bucks and a cracker, do you think it's enough To get us there 5 am, Friday morning Thursday night, far from sleep I'm still up and driving Can't go home obviously So I'll just change direction Cause they'll soon know where I live And I wanna live Got a full tank and some chips It was me and a gun And a man on my back And I sang "holy holy"As he buttoned down his pants You can laugh, it's kind of funny Things you think at times like these Like I haven't seen Barbados So I must get out of this Yes I wore a slinky red thing Does that mean I should spread For you, your friends Your father, Mr  Ed Every finger in the room Is pointing at me I wanna spit in their faces Then I get afraid of what that could bring I got a bowling ball in my stomach I got a desert in my mouth Figures that my courage Would choose to sell out now I've been looking for a savior in these dirty streets Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets I've been raising up my hands, drive another nail in Just what God needs: one more victim Why do we crucify ourselves every day I crucify myself, nothing I do is good enough for you I crucify myself every day I crucify myself And my heart is sick of being I said my heart is sick of being in Chains, oh oh oh Chains, oh oh ohCaught a lite sneeze, caught a light breeze Caught a lightweight lightning seed Boys on my left side, boys on my right side Boys in the middle and you're not here I need a big loan From the girl zone Building Tumbling down Didn't know our love was so small Couldn't stand it all Mr  St  John just bring your son The spire is hot and my cells can't feed And you've still got that Belle dragging your foots, yes I'm hiding it well, Sister Ernestine But I still got that Belle dragging my foots, yes Building Tumbling down Didn't know our love was so small Couldn't stand it all Mr  St  John just bring your sonYellow bird flying gets shot in the wing Good year for hunters and Christmas parties And I hate, and I hate And I hate, and I hate Elevator music, the way we fight The way I'm left here silent Oh, these little earthquakes Here we go again Oh, these little earthquakes Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces We danced in graveyards with vampires till dawn We laughed in the faces of kings, never afraid to burn And I hate, and I hate And I hate, and I hate Disintegration, watching us wither Black-winged roses that safely changed their color Oh, these little earthquakes Here we go again Oh, these little earthquakes Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces
