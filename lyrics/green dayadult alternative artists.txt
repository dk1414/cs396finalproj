I walk a lonely road The only one that I have ever known Don't know where it goes But it's home to me, and I walk alone I walk this empty street On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams Where the city sleeps And I'm the only one, and I walk alone I walk alone, I walk alone I walk alone, I walk aâ€”My shadow's the only one that walks beside me My shallow heart's the only thing that's beatin'Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me'Til then, I walk alone Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah I'm walkin' down the line That divides me somewhere in my mind On the borderline Of the edge and where I walk alone Read between the lines What's fucked up, and everything's all right Check my vital signs To know I'm still alive, and I walk aloneDon't wanna be an American idiot Don't want a nation under the new media And can you hear the sound of hysteria The subliminal mind-fuck America Welcome to a new kind of tension All across the alienation Where everything isn't meant to be okay In television dreams of tomorrow We're not the ones who're meant to follow For that's enough to argue Well, maybe I'm the faggot, America I'm not a part of a redneck agenda Now everybody, do the propaganda And sing along to the age of paranoia Welcome to a new kind of tension All across the alienation Where everything isn't meant to be okay In television dreams of tomorrow We're not the ones who're meant to follow For that's enough to argueSay hey!Cha!Hear the sound of the fallin' rain Comin' down like an Armageddon flame The shame, the ones who died without a name Hear the dogs howlin' out of key To a hymn called "Faith and Misery" And bleed, the company lost the war today I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies This is the dawning of the rest of our lives On holiday!Hear the drum poundin' out of time Another protester has crossed the line To find the money's on the other side Can I get another Amen  There's a flag wrapped around a score of men A gag, a plastic bag on a monument I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies This is the dawning of the rest of our lives On holiday  Do you have the time To listen to me whine About nothing and everything all at once I am one of those Melodramatic fools Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it Sometimes, I give myself the creeps Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me It all keeps adding up I think I'm cracking up Am I just paranoid Or am I just stoned And I went to a shrink To analyze my dreams She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down And I went to a whore He said my life's a bore So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down Sometimes, I give myself the creeps Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me It all keeps adding up I think I'm cracking up Am I just paranoid Huh yeah, yeahSummer has come and passed The innocent can never last Wake me up when September ends Like my father's come to pass Seven years has gone so fast Wake me up when September ends Here comes the rain again Falling from the stars Drenched in my pain again Becoming who we are As my memory rests But never forgets what I lost Wake me up when September ends Summer has come and passed The innocent can never last Wake me up when September ends Ring out the bells again Like we did when spring began Wake me up when September ends Here comes the rain again Falling from the stars Drenched in my pain again Becoming who we are As my memory rests But never forgets what I lost Wake me up when September endsFuck...Another turnin' point, a fork stuck in the road Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go So make the best of this test, and don't ask why It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time It's somethin' unpredictable, but in the end is right I hope you had the time of your life So take the photographs and still frames in your mind Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time Tattoos of memories, and dead skin on trial For what it's worth, it was worth all the while It's somethin' unpredictable, but in the end is right I hope you had the time of your life It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right I hope you had the time of your life It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right I hope you had the time of your lifeI'm the son of rage and love The Jesus of Suburbia The bible of "none of the above"On a steady diet of Soda-pop and Ritalin No one ever died for my sins in Hell As far as I can tell'Least the ones I got away with And there's nothin' wrong with me This is how I'm supposed to be In a land of make-believe That don't believe in me Get my television fix Sitting on my crucifix The livin' room, or my private womb While the moms and Brads are away To fall in love and fall in debt To alcohol and cigarettes and Mary Jane To keep me insane Doin' someone else's cocaineDo you know what's worth fightin' for When it's not worth dyin' for Does it take your breath away And you feel yourself suffocatin'?Does the pain weigh out the pride And you look for a place to hide Did someone break your heart inside You're in ruins One, twenty-one guns Lay down your arms and give up the fight One, twenty-one guns Throw up your arms into the sky You and I When you're at the end of the road And you lost all sense of control And your thoughts have taken their toll When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul Your faith walks on broken glass And the hangover doesn't pass Nothin's ever built to last You're in ruinsI'm having trouble trying to sleep I'm counting sheep, but running out As time ticks by, still I try No rest for cross-tops in my mind On my own, here we go My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed Dried up and bulging out my skull My mouth is dry, my face is numb Fucked up and spun out in my room On my own, here we go My mind is set on overdrive The clock is laughing in my face A crooked spine, my senses dulled Past the point of delirium On my own, here we goThis is definitely not the first video to surface of an execution The blue stash of men, they claimed responsibility for the executions Described as severely mentally disturbed It appears to show another hostage executed by the terrorist group Deserve to be annihilated I get my kicks, and I wanna start a rager I wanna dance like I'm on the video I got a fever for the violent behavior I'm sweatin' bullets like a modern Romeo Bang  Bang  Gimme fame!Shoot me up to entertain I am a semi-automatic lonely boy You're dead  I'm well fed!Give me death or gimme head Daddy's little psycho, and Mommy's little soldier I testify like a lullaby of memories Broadcasting live, and it's on my radio I got my photobomb I got my Vietnam I love a lie just like anybody else
