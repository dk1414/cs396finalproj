Following emergencies We might feel the same Only silhouettes are left now Even when we're down You're too early, June You're too early You're too early, June You're too early You're too early, June Following emergencies We might feel the same Only silhouettes are left now Even when we're down You're too early, June I'll always try to move with you I can hardly wait for our second fameI can't find me anymore but I'll breathe faster this time Now that I know you're ahead grabbing me from the flames like drowning quicksand I know you're hiding in this spark Will you stay with me until they're gone We're so close Wait, wait, I'll watch the time We're so close, your spark makes me drive Your spark makes me drive I don't mind waiting for you to say "Hello, hello, hello"I'll breathe faster this time, I'll breathe faster this time I know you can take the day off, will you spend it with me I can't find me anymore, new corridors I can't find me anymore, blank ammo swords But at least I found you At least I found youWill you break me down Will you break me down I'm bulletproof now I'm bulletproof now I can see every word bounce off you And I realized I spoke too soon If I fold, will you take me out If I fold, will you take me down You'll never find your way back I'll never find my way back I'm bulletproof now I'm bulletproof now I'm bulletproof now I can see every word bounce off you And I realized I spoke too soon If I fold, will you take me out If I fold, will you take me down You'll never find your way back I'll never find my way backYou talk out of line Will you take me tragic this time In time you'll try, somehow you brought the ceiling down In time you'll lie, don't let it weigh you down Step outside, divide the shake You're vanishing harder in every way Everyday, everyday Come ride with me out of this scene It's on repeat, you won't feel a thing Come ride with me out of this scene I still want to know How you brought the roof down How you turned the lights out Everyday I want to stay In every way I want to stay Everyday I want to stay In every way I want to stay Everyday I want to stay In every way I want to stay"Remember me", she said, is there any other way I'll wait for her to break me first I'm wondering how I'll be okay I broke again, just said your name I'm always looking back for you Aligned with indecision all the time I'll wait for her to break me first I'll wait for her to wash the lines I will be her last decision, right I will start from luck and then I'll work my way through the punches And show you like the first time I will be the one I will be the one to save you I will be there I will be there For the last time you sing I'll wait for her to break me first I'll wait for her to wash the lines I will be her last decision, right I will be her last decision I'll wait for her to break the lines I'll fade into a story just for herIn my head I know your side But I'm lost in dead divide I'll bear your stares for one last taste I could've been with you In my heart I hide in gray I mistimed, I lost today I feel undressed on this occasion Where we're breaking everything There's no single burn That can drag me back in It's time for me to dream again I'll try to find you a postcard in June In my eyes this round is yours I know you know Stuck like glue, I thought you said You were warming up to ideas of me Now I burn and you burn It's postmarked for another turn The lights are on But I can't believe you said those things to me There's no single burn that can drag me back inYou say this all the time You would come down, you would come down If I stopped asking you for more You're destroying all my words, look at me now You're pulling slow Don't you realize that hurts more That hurts more It's okay to lose control It's okay to lose control Would you come down just for me You're miles away from who I knew I can't reach you even when you're in the room You turn all the time, you turn all the time, one more time Here we go again I won't try to erase you, you're in every last detail But would you just come down You're pulling slow Don't you realize that hurts more That hurts more Maybe it's time Maybe it's time Maybe it's time Maybe it's timeI will be the first to call But then I forget you're still armed I can't see past you this time The battle scars you are I'm dragging in the ocean I'll bring the disappointment I can't hide from it this time Don't look at your false starts Look at all the heart shots you returned Don't look at your false starts And drive out the best part of me The best part is you The best part is you, the best part is you The best part is you if you'd just stick around The best part is you, the best part is you The best part is you if you'd just stick around I'm dragging in the ocean I'll bring the disappointment I can't hide from it this time You can't hide from it this time I can't hide from you this timeWrapped up in how it's framed I still run from every masquerade you made this way I burned the first time out I burned the first time I wasn't mine to save I know this time will hit you hard I think I'll run to the last row I know you're the star here I can't fight against every last piece you throw Picked up where we left off You still run from everything I gave to you We're breaking up for the hundredth time We broke up, so will you be mine  Why can't we let go Why can't we let go, let go I've decided I've turned to stone I'm numb from every last blow, every last throw Stuck on where we can never go We'll break this time, we'll break this time You say you're fine, I'll say I'm fineBattles in your arms, I warned you Lead me into the dark, I'll find you It's time to come apart, you warned me But you're still deciding if I should be the one Well come find me, on your mark, get set, go You release me to the wolves You release me to the wolves, they'll never understand me Don't remind me where we were Then we can part ways for sure Then we can part ways for sure On your mark, get set, go
