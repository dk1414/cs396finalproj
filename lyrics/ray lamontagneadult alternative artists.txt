Tell me what you're feeling I can take the pain Tell me that you mean it That you won't leave again Tell me what your heart wants Such a simple thing My heart is like paper Yours is like a flame I can't make you see If you don't by now I'll get through these changes Somehow, somehow Take it if you want it I'm so tired I just don't care Can't you see how much you hurt me It's like I wasn't there Tell me what your heart wants Such a simple thing My heart is like paper Yours is like a flame My heart is like paper Yours is like a flame I can't make you see If you don't by now I'll get through these chains Somehow, somehowThere comes a time A time in everyone's life When nothing seems to go your way Where nothing seems to turn out right There may come a time You just can't seem to find your place And for every door you open Seems like you get two slammed in your face That's when you need someone Someone that you, you can call When all your faith is gone It feels like you can't go on Let it be me Let it be me If it's a friend you need Let it be me Let it be me When it feels like you're always comin' up last Pockets full of nothin' ain't got no cash No matter where you turn You ain't got no place to stand You reach out for something and they slap your handTrouble Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble Trouble been dogging my soul since the day I was born Worry Worry, worry, worry, worry Worry just will not seem to leave my mind alone Well, I've been Saved by a woman I've been Saved by a woman I've been Saved by a woman She won't let me go She won't let me go, no She won't let me go, no, no...Trouble Oh, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble Feels like every time I get back on my feet she come around and knock me down again Worry Oh, worry, worry, worry, worry Sometimes I swear it feels like this worry Is my only friendCocaine flame in my bloodstream Sold my coat when I hit Spokane Bought myself a hard pack of cigarettes in the early morning rain Lately my hands they don't feel like mine My eyes been stung with dust, I'm blind Held you in my arms one time Lost you just the same Jolene I ain't about to go straight It's too late I found myself face down in the ditch Booze on my hair Blood on my lips A picture of you, holding a picture of me In the pocket of my blue jeans Still don't know what love means Still don't know what love means Jolene Ah, La, La, La, La, La JoleneShe lifts her skirt up to her knees Walks through the garden rows with her bare feet, laughin'I never learned to count my blessings I choose instead to dwell in my disasters I walk on down the hill Through grass, grown tall and brown And still it's hard, somehow, to let go of my pain On past the busted back of that Old and rusted Cadillac That sinks into this field, collecting rain Will I always feel this way So empty, so estranged And of these cutthroat busted sunsets These cold and damp white mornings, I have grown weary If through my cracked and dusty dime-store lips I spoke these words out loud, would no one hear me Lay your blouse across the chair Let fall the flowers from your hair And kiss me with that country mouth, so plain Outside, the rain is tapping on the leaves To me, it sounds like they're applauding us The quiet love we've madeHad our share of the pain Of the clouds and the rain Lean on me and I’ll lean on you And together, we’ll get through We always do We always do I know you’re scared ‘cause you can’t see the light You toss and turn through the night Holding me, and I’m holding you And together, we’ll get through We always do We always do We always do Where do you go when there’s no road to follow Faces look hollow, only strangers to you now Where do you turn when this living starts to burn Through layers that you learned to wrap around your heart somehow I turn to you I always do I turn to youWhen you came to me with your bad dreams and your fears It was easy to see that you'd been crying Seems like everywhere you turn catastrophe reigns But who really profits from the dying I could hold you in my arms I could hold you forever I could hold you in my arms, oh I could hold you forever When you kissed my lips with my mouth so full of questions My worried mind that you quiet Place your hands on my face Close my eyes and say Love is a poor man's food With no proper side I could hold you in my arms I could hold you forever And I could hold you in my arms, oh I could hold you foreverBaby It's been a long day, baby Things ain't been going my way You know I need you here To clear my mind All the time And baby The way you move me, it's crazy It's like you see right through me and make it easier And believe me, you don't even have to try Oh, because You are the best thing You are the best thing You are the best thing That ever happened to me Baby We've come a long way Baby You know I hope and I pray that you believe me When I say this love will never fade away Oh, becauseI hate to see you breaking down I hate to watch you fall apart I want to help you through it all I want to lift you when you fall Anything you want your life to mean it can mean Anything you want your life to mean, to mean This life is full of give and take Be careful of each step you take It doesn't matter lose or win It's all an illusion in the end Anything you want to be you can be Anything you want to be you can be Anything you want your life to mean it can mean Anything you want your life to mean, to mean I hate to see you crumbling You need to know we are your friends This life is full of give and take Be careful of the choice you make I guess you don't need it I guess you don't want me to repeat it But everything I have to give I'll give to you It's not like we planned it You tried to stay, but you could not stand it To see me shut down slow as though it was an easy thing to do Listen when all of this around us will fall over I tell you what we're gonna do Hey You will shelter me, my love And I, I will shelter you I will shelter you I left you heartbroken But not until those very words were spoken Has anybody ever made such a fool outta you It's hard to believe it Even as my eyes do see it The very things that make you live, they're killing you Listen when all of this around us will fall over I tell you what we're gonna do Hey You will shelter me, my love And I, I will shelter you I will shelter you I will shelter you I will shelter you I will shelter you
