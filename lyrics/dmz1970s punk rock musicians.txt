at the world You try your best to tolerate but you can't fucking cope They tell you they'll sell you whatever but you're not ready to buy They'll dig out your corpse from the graveyard and feed you their lies You tell them you had just enough but they're running with seconds Only a dumb ass says no to the offer of V IP passes to heaven Depression eats you away So ask me again who's the bigger man I get to be ridiculed every day The parentals and teachers ask me to stay in school but I won't stay I refuse to waste away!I'm too cool, I know all i'm gonna do is break some rules I'm too square to be unaware of the mind control Sometimes I get deep in it and let it sink in that everything I feel and everything I've seen is so much different than it would've been If they didn't cloud my judgement With all these government approved books and all the jugements Silent and catatonic, in the back of the class you sit, you drool They stare at you dead in the eye They talk to you like a fool treat you like a tool But you know the truth and as do I When they're all alone they look away from the mirror, they cry they're dead inside they can't hide from the pain Their pride has been eating them alive Teachers wearing devil masks cause they've been asked to No one bats an eye or so it seems But the revolution always has been tugging at the curtains to fall down from behind the scenesIt's too much to handle right now But i've been on this road to self destruction I wish there was an out , I'm out of here by now Steer clear of every thought that you don't know, is what they say Figure it out when you're on your way Don't go out to play with satan's children It's laundry day , You can't come out Three rocks off the table, gotta bounce a few around Three bullets through your skull, kid is what you'll go without They bring us up as sinners And they want us all to preach I didn't have an out at all Can't we go out, get sober this time I'm high on victimization and sublime poetry There's thoughts I want to optimize to a certain level of debrisOh oh oh oh is that the way I dont even wanna play the game It's not ok I feel so corrupt Every day i'm running out of light Everyone who knows me, knows I never ever wanna fight My words are my knives but I haven't really sharpened 'em It's been a long while since I picked up a book and read Attend to my needs god I need a cosmic helping hand I've been through black and blue and grey, but it's all turning red again And my mind is my enemy, number one I swear I ain't no sinner I just hide behind Anything i can while my demons hand in hand running around me in a circle Asking me to let them in And then,and then it all goes back to black And I can hear them whisper bout me Don't you ever doubt her she is nothing but a darkling Trust me she a heavy one, she our little baby blue She's the saddest fucking creature that i've ever witnessed She gon' do our bidding, she gon' lose her feelings, she will give us corpses in piles I'll be damned if hell don't rise Kill whatever's in your path, hurt whoevers in your reach Naaa man, satan , don't you ever fucking trust a bitch Kill whatever's in your path, hurt whoevers in your reach Naaa man, satan , don't you ever fucking trust a bitchSay goodnight, Say goodnight to my dead reflexes Say good morning, good morning to my bedhead Am I braindead  my mind weighs a ton I can't move an inch It's so insane, it's like i'm always in this game Always second guessing every single word I sing What is this mess all around me, i'm amazed What is this  verse doing to my fucking brain I don't need your slur words no I don't wanna feel your pain You should fill yourself with emptiness You're hollow like the rain It hurts me when you say Hurts me when you say you're all alone Because i'm right here you used to gaze at me like I was home Say goodbye all this dead weight I wouldn't want you near my casket I'm a basket case Disease, no ease I can't find breeze I rid myself of vanities from west to east I feel so high right now, there's only down from here They're waiting at the bottom, yeah they long to feed On my breaking bones I'm shaking still So I will stay high and I will try to be still I don't even care if you want me to heal Time to kill, kill ,kill I was standing, staring at trees I was stranded, down on my knees Begging for forgiveness and world peace All I was left with are words that I can't speak Broken, beaten down bruised I was hoping it was all just a ruse It's all in front of you don't you see Damnation, quarantine Can you tell  can you help me sail away When you look do you see what they want you to In your head mixing pieces of imagination, twisting them with reality have no fear they are near they aspire to be the voice within your head Hello light, am I your greatest creation No more fight in me We have reached retardation What more, what more can we build Isn't it everything you thought it would be Are you well Kept In the shadows shed your shell You have lost all your mellow and marvel look straight at me Are you happy with your memories Angel vs  devil fighting in my head Making empty promises keeping me undead Angel vs  devil fighting me instead Take your fucking slingshot leave I'll be left for dead Evil gnawing at me I wanna taste fools gold There's nothing out there for me now won't wait 'till
