And with a faint taste of cigarettes you write hallelujah songs Ain't it wonderful feeling alright So I tickle up your backbone And at the break of day you sink into dream, you dreamer And at the break of day you sink into a dream, you dreamer You dreamer, dreamer Oh, you dreamer You dreamer, you dreamer You dreamer, you dreamer You dreamer, you dreamer You dreamer, you dreamer On a date by a chocolate lake, down by the rotary Past town at the edge, looking down at butterflies And at the break of day you sink into a dream, you dreamer And at the break of day you sink into a dream, you dreamer You dreamer You dreamer, you dreamer You dreamer, you dreamer You dreamer, you dreamer You dreamer, you dreamer You dreamer, you dreamer You dreamer, you dreamer You dreamer, you dreamer You dreamer, you dreamer You dreamer, you dreamer You dreamerAnd if I can make it home tonight Don't leave it up to me again To feel fine And if I can make it home alright Give me the day or so to rest my mind But listen baby when you tell me everything's alright I stay up all night And baby when you tell me that it's me this time I don't close my eyes I sacrifice a little peace of mind Is love like this, always Is love like this, always And if I can make it up to you There's nothing that I won't do To make it feel brand new So I'll leave it up to you Baby when you tell me everything's alright Well I stay up all night And baby when you tell me that it's me this time I don't close my eyes I sacrifice a little peace of mindRising up, back on the street Did my time, took my chances Went the distance Now I’m back on my feet Just a man and his will to survive So many times, it happens too fast You trade your passion for glory Don’t lose your grip on the dreams of the past You must fight just to keep them alive It’s the eye of the tiger It’s the thrill of the fight Rising up to the challenge of our rival And the last known survivor Stalks his prey in the night And he’s watching us all with the eye of a tiger Face to face, out in the heat Hanging tough, stayin’ hungry They stack the odds Still we take to thе street For we kill with the skill to survive It’s thе eye of the tiger It’s the thrill of the fightI threw stones Out into the ocean Making wishes for you Just to come on home I've knit five whole sweaters On the couch by the window on my own I was baking shortbread cookies Until they had to cut me open Christmas-time I was listening to Patrick Watson And Gregory Alan Isakov While your heartbeat Was droppin' oxygen Was on the blue white sheet She was drumming Getting stoned and hanging on I've loved you for so long Happy birthday, baby Oooh, happy birthday, baby I picture you as a young man Climbing trees, chopping wood In the summertime Offer someone, say you love them Bring 'em home and I'll tell them about How when your heartbeat was dropping oxygen Was on the blue white sheet Getting stoned and hanging on I've loved for you so longI keep a light on For my baby almost every night I keep a light on Don’t want a crazy fight I keep a light on Even if it’s just the moon shining bright I keep a light on Everything’s gonna be alright I dreamed  I dreamed that you were all that I needed Dreamer, dreaming that you were all that I needed Dreamed that you were all that I needed Oh, shining waters Don’t want these going by Planting clovers I make my wishes at night I keep a light on Even if it’s just the sun in your eyes I keep a light on Everything’s gonna be alright I dreamed  I dreamed that you were all that I needed Dreamer, dreaming that you were all that I needed Dreamed that you were all that I neededLike a bird on the wire Like a drunk in a midnight choir I have tried, in my way, to be free Like a worm on a hook Like a knight from some old-fashioned book I have saved all my ribbons for thee If I, if I have been unkind I hope that you can just let it go by And if I, if I have been untrue I hope you know, it was never to you Like a baby, stillborn Like a beast with its horn I have torn everyone who reached out to me But, I swear by this song And by all that I have done wrong I will make it up to thee I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch Said to me, "Hey babe, you must not ask for so much"And a pretty woman lеaning at her darkened door Shе cried to me, "Why not ask for more "Oh, like a bird on the wire Like a drunk in a midnight choir I have tried, in my way, to be freeI'll be gone for The setting of the sun You'll be too Standing on the shore As the blue turns to me And says you'll, you'll go You'll go far, we know And says you'll, you'll go You'll go far, we know I see it so clearly now Why do you still follow it I've got all these questions, how And why do you still follow it When it doesn't lead us the way It doesn't lead us the way home Home Home Home HomeAnd with a faint taste of cigarettes you write hallelujah songs Ain't it wonderful feeling alright So I tickle up your backbone And at the break
