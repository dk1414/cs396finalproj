Light reflects from your shadow It is more than I thought could exist You move through the room Like breathing was easy If someone believed me They would be as in love with you as I am They would be as in love with you as I am They would be as in love with you as I am They would be in love, love, love And every day I am learning about you The things that no one else sees And the end comes too soon Like dreaming of angels And leaving without them And leaving without them Being as in love with you as I am Being as in love with you as I am Being as in love with you as I am Being as in love, love, love Love, love, love Love, love, loveI don't blame you We got carried away I can't hold on To an empty space Now you've found a new star to orbit It could be love I think you're too soon to call us old When and where did we go cold I thought I had you on hold And every time I let you leave I always saw you coming back to me When and where did we go cold I thought I had you on hold Where does it stop, where does it stop Where do you dare me to ?You've got the body, you've got the body Dare me to, dare me to Where does it stop, where does it stop Where do you dare me to ?You've got the body, you've got the body You've got the body, you've got the body I thought I had you on hold Where does it stop, where does it stop Where do you dare me to ?You've got the body, you've got the body Dare me to, dare me to Where does it stop, where does it stop Where do you dare me to ?You've got the body, you've got the body Dare me to, dare me toI saw you again, it felt like we had never met It's like the sun set in your eyes I never want it to rise And what have you done with the one I love When I look into your eyes, I see no surprise I always thought it was sad The way we act like strangers After all that we had We act like we had never met We make believe I've never seen your face, you neither me Don't catch my eye Don't register a smile You were more than just a friend, oh, but the feeling It never came to an ending, I can't bear you seeing I always thought it was a shame That we have to play these games It felt like you really knew me Now it feels like you see through meI watched you breathe in And I wished you'd stop Only for long enough Long enough It's hard to say Separate or combine I ask you one last time Did I hold you too tight Did I not let enough light in If a feeling appears If your mind should sway It's not a secret you should keep I won't let you slip away We used to be closer than this We used to be closer than this We used to get closer than this Is it something you miss We used to be closer than this We used to be closer than this We used to get closer than this Is it something you miss I'm in love with it Intoxicated I'm in rapture From the inside I can feel that you want to Wake up high on it Feel it suspending I'm enamoured Way up in the sky I can see that you want to I've been a romantic for so long All I've ever heard are love songs Singing oh-oh-oh Go on, I dare you Oh-oh-oh I dare you I get chills Heart's rate multiplies I'm on a different kind of high A rush of blood is not enough I need my feelings set on fire Now I'm deep in it, infatuated Strong attraction Side by side, and I know that you want toFiction when we're not together Mistaken for a vision, something of my own creation I wake up alone, with only daylight between us Last night the world was beneath us, tonight comes, too long We'll be torn apart by the break of day You're more than I can believe Would ever come my way Fiction when we're not together Mistaken for a vision, something of my own creation Come real life, why do I refuse you Cause if my fear's right, I risk to lose you And if I just mind and wake up alone Bring on the night Fiction when we're not together Mistaken for a vision, something of my own creation An uncertain haze, how am I to tell I know your face all too well, still I wake up alone Fiction when we're not togetherYou've applied the pressure To have me crystalised And you've got the faith That I could bring paradise I'll forgive and forget Before I'm paralysed Do I have to keep up the pace To keep you satisfied Things have gotten closer to the sun And I've done things in small doses So don't think that I'm pushing you away When you're the one that I've kept closest Ahh, ahh, ahh Ahh, ahh, ahh Ahh, ahh, ahh Ahh, ahh, ahh You don't move slow Taking steps in my direction The sound resounds, echo Does it lessen your affection  NoBefore it slips away Say something loving I just don't remember the thrill of affection I just don't remember Say something loving I need a reminder, the feeling's escaped me I went looking for it Could have been anyone's kiss Throwing my arms at no one When I gave up, I found love The thought flows through my mind And it's growing all the time I do myself a disservice To feel this weak, to be this nervous You say something loving It's so overwhelming, the thrill of affection Feels so unfamiliar You say something loving Without hesitation it hits me, hits me It feels so unfamiliarAll I have, I will give to you In dark times when no one wants to I will give you me And we'll be Us All I have, I will give to you In dark times when no one wants to I will give you me And we'll be Us And there's no one else Who knows me Like you do What I've done, you've done too The walls I Hide behind You walk through You just walk through Well I know all the words To take you apart You know I know your heart I want to mend your heart You're broke down Why don't you tell me from the start You know I know your heart I want to mend your heartMy heart is beating In a different way Been gone such a long time I don't feel the same My heart is beating In a different way Been gone such a long time Will you miss me When there's nothing to see Tell me, how did this come to be And now there's no hope for you and me My heart is beating In a different way Been gone such a long time I don't feel the same My heart is beating In a different way Been gone such a long time
