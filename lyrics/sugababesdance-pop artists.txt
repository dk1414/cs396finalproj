Push the button Push the button Pu-push the button Push the button I'm busy throwing hints that he keeps missing Don't have to think about it I want a kiss And everything around it but he's too distant I wanna feel his body, I can't resist it I know my hidden looks can be deceiving But how obvious should a girl be I was taken by the early conversation piece And I really like the way that he respect me I've been waiting patiently for him to come and get it I wonder if he knows that he can say it and I'm with it I knew I had my mind made up from the very beginning Catch this opportunity so you and me could feel it 'cause If you're ready for me, boy You'd better push the button and let me know Before I get the wrong idea and go You're gonna miss the freak that I controlIt was so easy that night Should have been strong; yeah, I lied Nobody gets me like you Couldn't keep hold of you then How could I know what you meant There was nothing to compare to I know everything changes All the cities and faces But I know how I feel about you There's a mountain between us But there's one thing I'm sure of That I know how I feel about you Can we bring yesterday back around 'Cause I know how I feel about you now I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down But I know how I feel about you now All that it takes one more chance Don't let our last kiss be our last Give me tonight and I'll show youStrange fear I ain't felt for years The boy's coming and I'm close to tears I can't let go of you now Imagination's playing round for free In my world I take him out for tea Oh my God, can't say no Skipping school, go walk for air I just had to get out of bed I'm on overload in my head Train comes I don't know its destination It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation Train comes I don't know its destination It's a one-way ticket to a madman situation Life in a dream, time does come true And in my sleep I think of you Feather bed by myself Basically probability Says that fate's come side with me It's been so long on my shelf Train comes I don't know its destination It's a one-way ticket to a madman situation Train comes I don't know its destination It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situationRound round baby, round round Spinning out on me I don't need no man, got my kicks for free And we'll ride, still fired on the beat down low I don't need nobody but my honey's when I go Round baby, round round, spinning out on me I don't need no man, got my kicks for free When you stare at my face You're messing with my brain If you try to convince me, then you better think again If you move to the music, the music's got to give If it's too complicated, that's the way I wanna live If you hate me, I will show you How to break me into something new If you want me, run away now If you stop me, then I'll hit the ground And we go, and we go Round round baby, round round Spinning out on me I don't need no man, got my kicks for free And we'll ride, still fired on the beat down low I don't need nobody but my honey's when I goWhen I was seven, they said I was strange I noticed that my eyes and hair weren't the same I asked my parents if I was okay They said you're more beautiful and that's the way They show that they wish that they had your smile So my confidence was up for a while I got real comfortable with my own style I knew that they were only jealous cause People are all the same And we only get judged by what we do Personality reflects name And if I'm ugly then so are you So are you There was a time when I felt like I cared That I was shorter than everyone there People made me feel like life was unfair And I did things that made me ashamed Cause I didn't know my body would change I grew taller than them in more ways But there will always be the one who will say Something bad to make them feel greatLet me lay it on the line I got a little freakiness inside And you know that the man Has got to deal with it I don't care what they say I'm not about to pay nobody's way Cause it's all about the dark in me Mm-hmm I wanna freak in the morning A freak in the evening, just like me I need a roughneck brother That can satisfy me, just for me If you are that kind of man, 'cause I'm that kind of girl I got a freaky secret, everybody sing'Cause we don't give a damn about a thing'Cause I will be a freak, until the day until the dawn And we can pump, pump all through the night till the early morn'Come on and I will take you around the 'hood on a gangsta lean'Cause we can pump, pump Any time of day it's all good for meYou look into my eyes I go out of my mind I can't see anything'Cause this love's got me blind I can't help myself I can't break the spell I can't even try I'm in over my head You got under my skin I got no strength at all In the state that I'm in And my knees are weak And my mouth can't speak Fell too far this time]Baby, I'm too lost in you Caught in you Lost in everything about you So deep, I can't sleep I can't think I just think about the things that you do I'm too lost in you Too lost in youI live my life in chains Got my hands in chains And I can't stick with the cards That I got with a deal Like this I must insist That a girl's got more to do Then be the way you think a woman should I'm taking it into my own hands In this man's land I can understand Why I'm taking command I've had enough of stuff And now it's time to think about me, me yeah And you can easily gamble your life away Second after second And the day by day You play the game or you walk away It's a new turn on a blue day And a cool deal of life for me And it's all good I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier I know that the clubs are weapons of war I know that diamonds mean money for this art But that's not the shape of my heartSeven hours since you went away Eleven coffees, Ricki Lake on play But late at night when I'm feeling blue I'd sell my ass before I think of you Seven hours since you closed the door Started a diet, got a manicure Erased your number from my telephone And if you call me, I won't be at home They say Why you cry-y-y For the guy-y-y Say goodbye Run away Why you cry-y-y For the guy-y-y Say goodbye I said O K, cause Ooh, boy d'you miss me like a hole in the head Because I do boy And it's cool boy And ooh, bet you never thought I'd get out of bed Because of you boy Such a fool boyI'll make it through the rainy days I'll be the one who stands here longer than the rest When my landscape changes, rearranges I'll be stronger than i've ever been No more stillness, more sunlight Everything's gonna be alright I know that there's gonna be a change Better find your way out of your fear If you wanna come with me Then that's the way it's gotta be I'm all alone and finally I'm getting stronger You'll come to see Just what I can be I'm getting stronger Sometimes I feel so down and out Like emotion that's been captured in a maze I had my ups and downs Trials and tribulations I overcome it day by day Feeling good and almost powerful A new me, that's what i'm looking for
