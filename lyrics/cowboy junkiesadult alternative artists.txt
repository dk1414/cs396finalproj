Anyone who's ever had a heart Wouldn't turn around and break it And anyone who's ever played a part Wouldn't turn around and hate it Sweet Jane, sweet Jane Sweet, sweet Jane You're waiting for Jimmy down in the alley Waiting there for him to come back home Waiting down on the corner And thinking of ways to get back home Sweet Jane, sweet Jane Sweet, sweet Jane Anyone who's ever had a dream Anyone who's ever played a part Anyone who's ever been lonely And anyone who's ever split apart Sweet Jane, sweet Jane Sweet, sweet Jane Heavenly wine and roses Seem to whisper to me when you smile Heavenly wine and roses Seem to whisper to me when you smile La la la la, la la la...Sweet Jane Sweet, sweet JaneSun comes up, it's tuesday morning Hits me straight in the eye Guess you forgot to close the blind last night Oh, that's right, I forgot, it was me I sure do miss the smell of black coffee in the morning The sound of water splashing all over the bathroom The kiss that you would give me even though I was sleeping But I kind of like the feel of this extra few feet in my bed Telephone's ringing, but I don't answer it'cause everybody knows that good news always sleeps till noon Guess it's tea and toast for breakfast again Maybe I'll add a little t.v  too No milk  god, how I hate that Guess I'll go to the corner, get breakfast from jenny She's got a black eye this morning, 'jen how'd ya get it  'She says, 'last night, bobby got a little bit out of hand'Lunchtime  I start to dial your number Then I remember so I reach for something to smoke And anyways I'd rather listen to coltrane Than go through all that shit again There's something about an afternoon spent doing nothing Just listening to records and watching the sun fallingI said "Mama, he's crazy and he scares me But I want him by my side Though he's wild and he's bad And sometimes just plain mad I need him to keep me satisfied"I said "Papa, don't cry cause it's alright And I see you in some of his ways Though he might not give me the life that you wanted I'll love him the rest of my days"Misguided angel hangin' over me Heart like a Gabriel, pure and white as ivory Soul like a Lucifer, black and cold like a piece of lead Misguided angel, love you 'til I'm dead I said "Brother, you speak to me of passion You said never to settle for nothing less Well, it's in the way he walks It's in the way he talks His smile, his anger and his kisses"I said "Sister, don't you understand He's all I ever wanted in a man I'm tired of sittin' around the T.V  every night Hoping I'm finding a Mr  Right"Too many years on the rinks of Montreal Too many years in the lofts of old T OToo many nights in the bowels of Avenue B Too many days in the arms of Lady T Or maybe I'm just getting old'Cause, fuck, I hate the cold Too much time in the bed of a petty thief Too much time in the arms of a failed conceit He told me how he love the best about me And then he told me what was best And maybe I'm just getting old But, fuck, I hate the cold Too much fun on the roads of the U SA Too much fun plugging in and starting to play Too much time on this winding trail Of a tale yet to be told Baby, I'm getting old And, fuck, I hate the cold I fucking hate it I hate the cold I fucking hate the coldI only want to say That if there is a way I want my baby back with me'cause he's my true love My only one don't you see And on that fateful day Perhaps in the new sun of May My baby walks back into my arms I'll keep him beside me Forever from harm You see I was afraid To let my baby stray I kept him too tightly by my side And then one sad day He went away and he died Blue Moon, you saw me standing alone Without a dream in my heart Without a love of my own Blue Moon, you knew just what I was there for You heard me saying a prayer for Someone I really could care forWe are miners, miners hard rock miners To the shaft house we must go Bottles on our shoulders We are marching to the slope On the line boys, on the line boys Drill your holes and stand in line'til the shift boss comes to tell you You must drill her out on time Can't you feel the rock dust in your lungs It'll cut down a miner when he is still young Two years and the silicosis takes hold And I feel like I'm dying from mining for gold Yes, I feel like I'm dying from mining for gold, mining for goldI hope that I find what I'm reaching for The way that it is in my mind I hope that I won't be that wrong anymore And maybe to have learned this time Someday I'll get over you I'll live to see it all through But I'll always miss Dreaming my dreams with you But I won't let it change me, not if I can I'd rather believe in love And give it away as much as I can To those that I am fondest of Someday I'll get over you I'll live to see it all through But I'll always miss Dreaming my dreams with you Someday I'll get over you I'll miss dreaming with you Someday I'll get over you I'll miss dreaming with you SomedayHe searched for those wings that he knew That this angel should have at her back And although he can't find them He really don't mind Because he knows they'll grow back And he reached for that halo that he knows That she had when she first caught his eye Although his hand came back empty He's really not worried'cause he knows it still shines I can't promise that I'll grow those wings Or keep this tarnished halo shined But I'll never betray your trust Angel mine I search all the time on the ground For our shadows cast side by side Just to remind me that I haven't gone crazy That you exist and are mine And I know that your skin is as warm and as real As that smile in your eyes But I have to keep touching and smelling And tasting for fear it's all lies I can't promise that I'll grow those wings Or keep this tarnished halo shined But I'll never betray your trust Angel mineA candle burning for everything I've ever wanted A tattoo burned for everything I've ever wanted and lost I had a long list of names that I kept in my back pocket But I've cut it down to one and your name's at the top Won't you share a common disaster Share with me a common disaster A common disaster I found myself a friend but he's crooked as a stick in water So now I'm writing fairy tales to catch the spirit of revenge He's got a plan to steal my little sister But I'm not too concerned 'cause I will get him in the end Won't you share a common disaster Share with me a common disaster A common disaster Going to find me someone to share a common disaster Run away with me from a life so cramped and dull Not worry too much about the happily-ever-after Just keep the Caddy moving 'til we're well beyond that hill Won't you share a common disaster Share with me a common disaster A common disasterBreaking away to the other side I wanna make sense of why we live and die I don't get it, I don't get it I ask my friends if they understand They just laugh at me and watch another band They don't worry, they don't worry Lookin' for a way to lose my load I wanna make it easy to walk this road I can't find it, yeah I can't find it Yeah, I'm looking for answers in so many places I open my mind I don't get it Walkin' this earth and keepin' my peace I do what I want but the price is steep It don't seem right, it don't seem right My mama she told me "One step at a time And sooner or later you'll walk that line"I don't want to, I don't want to Takin' my time to live and die I wanna find a way to do it right And I ease on, and I ease on
