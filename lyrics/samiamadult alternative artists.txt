What the hell have you got to look forward to I don't hear anybody knocking at your door Your life has been a message in a bottle Dumped in the ocean, never reaching any shore At the point where nothing makes you happy These days seem darker than they've ever been before Here it comes again, that old familiar feeling Get sick and leave your troubles on the floor Just when  thought you were breaking down, she found you Just when I thought you were breaking down Just when I thought you were breaking down You're shuttin' people out has become more like a reflex They used to be your friends, but they don't know you anymore Don't mean to hurt you, but it's my only self defense I make myself a mystery, so they don't know who to look for Look at yourself, have you noticed your complexion Looks like you've been spending too much time indoors In the mirror can you see your reflection Or am i the only one who's noticed that you look bored Just when I thought you were breaking down Just when I thought you were breaking down, she found you Just when I thought you were breaking down Just when I thought you were breaking downSitting in the corner i don't know what to think i can't speak i sink a little deeper with every drink i try to sleep i shut my eyes and like a leaky faucet fear floods the room the one that drips away patiently by day it was either lost or it was stolen but it's been missing for too long i woke up one morning and i couldn't see the sunrise i can't recall the exact moment now but it began some time ago and it makes me wonder after all i've done what have i got to show i'm aggravated i'm what you created now don't break meMonday Sunshine So high It's hard to see Through the sunday clouds still lingering How you wound up in the sea Spinning above While burning inside Further you go and deeper you dive Don't mean to deceive But it's they who believe They fall in love with the girl they perceive not you Blind them with kindness Until they are reminding they're lonely and desperate And you have a secret It's something they all think they need Spinning above and burning inside Further you go and deeper you dive Don't mean to deceive But it's they who believe They fall in love with the girl they perceive not you They see what they want in you they Get what they need from you They take advantage of you They would be nothing without youFour hundred of my closest friends Forgotten names that I pretend To know, it hasn't even been that long So how've you been, you look the same Remember when the Doughboys played At Gilman and they broke up on your lawn And I wish it could always be like This is something I've been missing It's not too late to change what you've become The last time I saw everyone We buried our friend and his gun I think he'd be happy here right now So don't be jaded I don't wanna spend another long and lonely weekend by the phone Without anyone to call I've had a lot of time to think and I'm so tired of thinking I know why he put that bullet in his skull I forgot how good it feels To be part of a spinning wheel Supported and supporting, on and onHow do i still want you With everything you've made me do You almost taste like hate And i can't stay away Self destruction, no pain Character reduction, slow fade Lazy reflex, no feeling Hand to mouth, tightly bound Remember when we met Seemed so innocent But i was different then Now i know how the story ends Self destruction, no pain Character reduction, slow fade Lazy reflex, no feeling Hand to mouth, tightly bound I'm the one with the unreached goals Never thought i could sink so low I believed everything i was told Save me from the undertow Big on suckers bets Placed my soul in debt Looks like from where I'm at There's no coming backHow did you get this far, understanding nothing at all You're nothing but small talk, is there anybody home Is there a secret plan that you follow, do you do any thinking of your own Make up your mind, flip a coin or something Just say anything but i don't know You do so much sneaking around, is it some kind of a stupid little game Let's pretend that you're the master mind, and i'm your little blind dope Stay out of my sight, i'll put you out of my mind Don't even want to know you anymore Stay out of my sight, i'll put you out of my mind Out of my mind Don't even want to know you anymore Stay out of my sight, i'll put you out of my mind How did you get this far, understanding nothing at all You're nothing but small talk, is there anybody home Transparent, simple mind Just hold your hands over my eyes Unless you're trying to insult me You'd better work harder on those liesCleaning up the mess that you made Cleaning up the mess that you made Cleaning up the mess that you made of me This is gonna be A better year for me May not believe it but it's true I'm not a scientist Don't follow politics Don't know how i know i just do Cleaning up the mess that you made Cleaning up the mess that you made Cleaning up the mess that you made of me Cleaning up the mess that you made Cleaning up the mess that you made Cleaning up the mess that you made of me I have a tendency Of being my worst enemy But that's all over now I've called a truce Don't know if gods exist Or if they'd give a shit Bet money i'll be better off real soonI'm free He can't touch me Six feet down And there's no sadness Hands and heads full Old and hostile fists are pounding Nothing's simple No respect or meaning Why the screaming When he's gone Burn the house down Too proud to come to me When you were dying Well look at the dash Now you're frying Hands and heads full Old and hostile fists are pounding Nothing's simple No respect or meaning Why the screaming When he's goneShe's always restless She's over-medicated With the kind of emotion that feels out of place Never give your opinion they've got all the answers Follow the leader but remember where you've been..So don't leave, it's not me you know Can't control what goes through my mind So stay, please understand I don't mean all i said tonight Haven't slept for days and my words don't seem to come out right It's just a phase that you're gonna grow out of when you die And it's alright You know, everything's going to be just fine Is it too much to ask for,some kind of ordinary life Two weeks clean a vague reality From a life time clouded Lost details of your dreams The will to eat The pills you need to sleep Are things you never think if till they're always on your mind..So don't leave, it's not me you know Can't control what goes through my mind So stay,please understand I don't mean all i said tonightThis side, I show But which side is me Lost somewhere in between There's a price you pay for living She had a boy Couldn't make him grow Saw the truth in his eyes Filled him full of shit And made him one of her own Young and old We do as we're told You believe it But can't comprehend When your life ends Same way that it began You get what you deserve This man, you see But which man is me Who am I supposed to be I take a piece of everything I'm given She had a boy Couldn't make him grow Saw the truth in his eyes Filled him full of shit And made him one of her own
