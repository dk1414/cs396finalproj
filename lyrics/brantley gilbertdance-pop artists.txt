Well I heard it through the grapevine Good daddy and a husband is a-doing time Said his wife and his kids was in the house Some old boy broke in, man it all went south When he dropped the hammer on his forty five Now he's in the pen; twenty-five to life I hate to say, but if it'd have been me Well, I'd have saidPreacher said he died too young Over there totin' that gun For Uncle Sam and our

learned the words to "Amazing Grace"Never felt the chill of a pew when you lost faith Well, blood, sweat, and tears wouldn't mean a thing If you didn't strike out a couple hundred times If you never hit rock bottom, never cussed the sky You would've never known to ask the good Lord why Or ever changed your life If you never had hard days If you never had a heartbreak Never had more than you can take Or carried the weight Of life on your shoulders Would you feel like you earned it Would you live with a purpose Or ever known your own strength If you never had hard days You wouldn't know what it's like to dance in the rain Never see the silver lining when the skies go gray You wouldn't know a dream come true from a few that don't You'd never find your way on a broken roadI can't go for a ride to clear my head'Cause everything I pass puts you back in it Yeah, we're done, movin' on But you can't be too far gone'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town Every back road we've ever gone down Friday night bleachers, Sunday pews Ain't a county line mile without a memory of you Every whisper, every room I walk in Every time the bartender fills it up again Everybody knows why I'm here, and you ain't around'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town Oh, we said this goodbye was the last I guess I could leave, I could run from the past And from us, and from you But this is where I belong, this is my home too What happens in a small town stays in a small town Every back road we've ever gone down Friday night bleachers, Sunday pews Ain't a county line mile without a memory of you Every whisper, every room I walk in Every time the bartender fills it up again Everybody knows why I'm here, and you ain't around'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small townI'm feelin' last night this mornin'A  train wreck pain in my head But  when I reach for the hair of the dog in the drawer Found a dusty old Bible instead Thought I ain't been to service since my granddaddy passed Finish  my cigarette out there on the front steps And  then slipped in the back by myself You bring on the fire and brimstone Tell  me I'm goin' to hell Yeah, which one of you will throw the first stone I guess I'll see you there You bring on the fire And  then I heard the reverend He said, "Turn and shake your neighbor's hand"One by one saw them all turn around just to stare back at me Like the wretch that I am You bring on the fire and brimstone Tell me I'm goin' to hell Yeah, which one of you will throw the first stone I guess I'll see you there You bring on the fire You bring on the fire Bring it onHey old friend, thanks for callin'It's good to know somebody cares Yeah she's gone, but I don't feel like talkin'It might be just too much to bear To hear somebody say it stops hurting Or to hear somebody say she ain't worth it'Cause you don't know her like I do You'll never understand You don't know we've been through That girl's my best friend And there's no way you're gonna help me She's the only one who can No, you don't know how much I've got to lose You don't know her like I do I can't forget, I'm drowning in these memories It fills my soul with all the little things And I can't cope, it's like a death inside the family It's like she stole my way to breathe So don't try to tell me I'll stop hurting Don't try to tell me she ain't worth itIt's four in the mornin', dirt road in Georgia Blue lights in the rearview Your blue eyes wide open Like boy, what you tryin' to do Think that left turn lost 'em And it's turnin' you on You're climbin' over the console So I'm guessin' it's on Alright, alright You're lovin' this fast lane life Don't lie, don't lie You don't wanna say goodnight I tried to tell ya I was crazy Tried to tell ya that I'd lost my mind Tried to tell ya I was nothin' but trouble, baby Yeah, but baby, you thought I was lyin'Now you got yourself a situation An angel fallin' for a renegade You can't blame me if you try and never change me Yeah, I tried to tell ya I was crazy Middle of the night, I'm outside in your driveway Baby, let's go Didn't call or nothin', just showed up And told you it's time to roll Gotcha head over heels Girl, ain't this a trip It's ride or die for real You're lovin this bad boy sh-Every time I make it to a front door droppin' off a girl any other boy would die for any day I  see your face and I say goodnight And  even if it makes it to the back seat thinkin' I'm finally movin' on, it's on, it's all good It's all wrong'Cause she ain't home'Cause  she ain't home She  don't taste like sweet tea Ain't got a voice that sounds like Dixie Don't  play dashboard drums with her bare feet There ain't no memory, ain't no history like Your little smile from the choir Don't light up a sky like a Friday night She  ain't the girl mama keeps in a frame in the drawer Nah, she ain't home Every time I try to turn a page, I'm seein' words in red I love you, I miss you, I can't keep doin' this And I ain't over it And she ain't done nothin' wrong'Cause she ain't home She don't taste like sweet tea Ain't got a voice that sounds like Dixie Don't play dashboard drums with
