Well, I play an old guitar from nine till half past one I'm just tryin' to make a livin' watching everybody else havin' fun Well, I don't miss much if it happens on a dancehall floor Mercy look what just walked through that door Well, hello T-R-O-U-B-L-E Tell me what in the world You doin' A-L-O-N-E Yeah say hey good L double O-K-I-N-G Well, I smell T-R-O-U-B-L-E I was a little bitty baby when my papa hit the skids Mama had a time tryin' to raise nine kids She told me not to stare cause it was impolite She did the best she could to try to raise me right Cause mama never told me 'bout nothin' like Y-O-U Bet your mama musta been another good lookin' honey too Hey good L double O-K-I-N-G Well, I smell T-R-O-U-B-L-E Well, a sweet talkin', sexy walkin', honky tonkin' baby The men are gonna love ya and the woman gonna hate ya Remindin' them of everything they're never gonna be May be the beginning of a world war threeI got rice cookin' in the microwave Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, hey I'm doin' alright Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth It's neither drink nor drug induced, no I'm just doin' alright And it's a great day to be alive I know the sun's still shining When I close my eyes There's some hard times in the neighborhood But why can't every day be just this good It's been fifteen years since I left home And said good luck to every seed I'd sown Gave it my best and then I left it alone I hope they're doin' alright Now I look in the mirror and what do I see A lone wolf there starin' back at me Long in the tooth but harmless as can be Lord I guess he's doing alrightBaby, close that suitcase you've been packin'Just sit down and talk to me a while I know you tried to tell me what was lackin'But I guess I must have missed it by a mile Well, this time girl I swear to you I'll listen Help me understand where I went wrong It's hard to find myself in this position Scared that I'll go crazy once you're gone Help me hold on to what we had Once our love was strong, it can be again You said it takes two to make love last You were right all along, so help me hold on What have I got to do to make it better What have I got to do to make you see That even though I promised you forever I never knew how hard that would be I realize I took your love for granted But I've learned that love worth havin' don't come free And I'll pay any price it takes to keep you Satisfied and stayin' here with meI can't hide the way I feel about you Anymore I can't hold the hurt inside, keep the pain out of my eyes Anymore My tears no longer waiting My resistance ain't that strong My mind keeps recreating A life with you alone And I'm tired of pretending I don't love you anymore Let me make one last appeal to show you how I feel About you 'Cause there's no one else, I swear, holds a candle anywhere Next to you My heart can't take the beating Not havin' you to hold A small voice keeps repeating Deep inside my soul It says I can't keep pretending I don't love you anymoreShe stayed up all night and cried into her pillow And fought off the urge to just break down and call Last night to find the fault seemed so darn easy But now who's to blame don't matter much at all She thinks if she calls him, it just shows weakness So the hurt goes on with every tear she's cried Ain't it sad to see a good love fall to pieces Chalk another heartbreak up to foolish pride Turn out the lights, the competition's over The stubborn souls are the losers here tonight And while the bridges burn Another hard, hard lesson's learned As in the ashes passion slowly dies And this romance goes down to foolish pride He relives every word they spoke in anger He walks the floor and punches out the wall To apologize to her, would be so simple But instead, he cries, "I'll be damned if I'll crawl"If he loses her, he's lost his best friend And more than just a lover can provide So he wrestles with emotions that defeat him Chalk another love lost up to foolish prideWell, I'm a runnin' down the road, tryin' to loosen my load I've got seven women on my mind:Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me One says she's a friend of mine Take it easy, take it easy Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy Lighten up while you still can, don't even try to understand Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy Well, I'm a standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona And such a fine sight to see:It's a girl, my Lord, in a flat bed Ford Slowin' down to take a look at me Come on, baby, don't say maybe I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me We may lose and we may win though we will never be here again So open up, I'm climbin' in, so take it easy Well, I'm a runnin' down the road, tryin' to loosen my load Got a world of trouble on my mind Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover She's so hard to find Take it easy, take it easy Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy Come on, baby, don't say maybe I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save meYou say you were wrong to ever leave me alone And now you're sorry, you're lonesome and scared And you say you'd be happy if you could just come back home Well, here's a quarter, call someone who cares Call someone who'll listen, and might give a damn Maybe one of your sordid affairs But don't you come around here handin' me none of your lies Here's a quarter, call someone who cares Girl, I thought what we had could never turn bad So your leavin' caught me unaware But the fact is you've run, girl, that can't be undone So here's a quarter, call someone who cares Call someone who'll listen, yeah, or might give a damn Maybe one of your sordid affairs But don't you come around here handing me none of your lies Here's a quarter, call someone who caresDaddies were Daddies and Mamas were saints What preachers were preachin', you could take to the bank Kids played outside up until it turned dark When the world turned slower and you could smoke in a bar Trucks took a beatin', the workin' man too You could turn on the six o'clock and get the whole truth A seatbelt was a backup for Mama's right arm When the world turned slower and you could smoke in a bar My, oh my, how times have changed But man, sometimes, I miss them old days They say we'vе come a long way, but I'd say it's a little bit too far From when thе world turned slower and you could smoke in a bar Neighbors came by and talked on the porch We all said goodnight and never locked the front door Even downtown, you could still see the stars When the world turned slower and you could smoke in a bar My, oh my, how times have changed But man, sometimes, I miss them old days They say we've come a long way, but I'd say it's a little bit too far From when the world turned slower and you could smoke in a barI had big plans for our future Said I'd give you the whole world somehow I tried makin' good on that promise Thought I'd be so much further by now Never could build you a castle Even though you're the queen of my heart But I've had the best of intentions from the start Now some people think I'm a loser'Cause I seldom get things right But you make me feel like a winner When you wrap me in your arms so tight Please tell me you will remember No matter how much I do wrong That I had the best of intentions all along I'd gave you a ring, and I promised you things I always thought we'd do But my best-laid plans slipped right through my hands To show my love for you And if you could read my heart Then you'd know without exception It was all with the best of intentionsWell it's a long way to Richmond Rollin' north on 95 With a redhead ridin' shotgun And a pistol by my side Tearin' down that highway Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde We met at a truckstop Johnson City, Tennessee I was gassin' up my Firebird When I heard her callin' me...mmm hmm Said, 'Which way are you headed, boy Do you need some company'She had me stoppin' at a quick mart Before we made it out of town Next thing she was runnin' at me Tellin' me to lay that hammer down Cause there's a man right behind me Doin' his best to slow me down Yeah and it's a long way to Richmond Rollin' north on 95 With a redhead ridin' shotgun And a pistol by my side Tearin' down that highway Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde
