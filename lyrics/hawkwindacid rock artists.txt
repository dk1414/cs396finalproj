electric line To your Zodiac sign I've got a silver machine I've got a silver machine I've got a silver machine I've got a silver machine It flies Out of a dream It's antiseptically clean You're gonna know where I've been Do you want to ride See yourself going by The other side of the sky I'm in a silver machineI am the centre of this universe The wind of time is blowing through me And it's all moving relative to me It's all a figment of my mind In a world that I've designed I'm charged with cosmic energy Has the world gone mad or is it me I am the creator of this universe And all that it was meant to be So that we might learn to see The foolishness that lives in us And stupidity that we must suss How to banish from our minds And if you call this living I must be blindAssault and Battery Lives of great men all remind us We may make our lives sublime And departing leave behind us Footprints in the sands of time Of hewn stones the sacred circle Where the wizard sages sat Let us try to remember All the times where they were at So your thoughts, they were expecting Assault and battery on the human anatomy Assault and battery on the human anatomy, man Lives of great men all remind us We may make our lives sublime And departing leave behind us Footprints in the sands of time So your thoughts, they were expecting Assault and battery on the human anatomy Assault and battery

I'm a two-tone panther So let's not talk of love and flowers And things that don't explode You know we used up all of our magic powers Time to do it in the road I'm a political bandit And you don't understand it You took my dream and canned it It is not the way I planned it I'm society's destructor I'm a petrol bomb constructor I'm a cosmic light conductor I'm the people's debt collector So watch out Mr  Business Man Your empire's about to blow You know I think you had better listen, man In case you did not knowWell, hurry on sundown See what tomorrow brings Hurry on sundown See what

a cause Embarrassed by a show of love But would stand by the man of the feeble blood This bond meant much more to him Than a kingdom offered by a queen No words for this silent trust As the Sword goes on to sate its lust Moonglum and Elric hunting Theleb K'aarna Myshella now replacing Queen Yishana See them travel through open skies See the amazing steel bird fly Armies stand, soon to fall Sorcery is the tune they call Pitting wit against flesh and gall Timeless searching in timeless halls Wandering out to meet his death To find this was no release Searching for some sort of ease Denying feelings that made him weak Moonglum and Elric hunting Theleb K'aarna Myshella now replacing Queen Yishana See them travel through open skies See the amazing steel bird flyMagnu, horse with golden mane I want your help yet once again Walk not the earth but fly through space As lightning flash or thunders race Swift as the arrow from the bow Come to me so that no one can know Sunbeams are my shafts to kill All men who dare imagine ill Deceit that fears the light of day Fly from the glory of my ray Good minds open and take new light Until diminished by the reign of night Until diminished by the reign of night Until diminished by the reign of night Until diminished by the reign of night A burning brand was seen to fall It lit the darkness of the hall The flying hoofbeats circling in Come to me and let us spin Sunbeams are my shafts to kill All men who dare imagine ill Deceit that fears the light of day Fly from the glory of my ray Good minds open and take new light Until diminished by the reign of night Until diminished by the reign of night Until diminished by the reign of night Until diminished by the reign of night Until diminished by the reign of night Until diminished by the reign of night Reign of night Reign of night Reign of nightQuestions asked but never known The feeling governs which way I'll go Endless circles on my mind Spiralling a downward climb which way I'll go The thoughts are there for you to find But you never know which way I'll go Those flashing lights are warning me But ever bidding voices see You're caught in a web of emptiness The tales told the path you tread Does it lead into your head Or back to a world of emptiness Smiling faces watching me Helping hands just wait and see which way I'll go White walls stretching in the sun Was it here that I began which way I'll go Faintly voices plead with me Ever asking, ever see which way I'll go Those flashing lights are warning me But ever bidding voices see You're caught in a web of emptiness The tales told the path you tread Does it lead into your head Or back to a world of emptiness Think about the things that we should have done before The way things are going the end is about to fall We took the wrong step years ago We took the wrong step years ago We took the wrong step years ago Look around and see the warning close at hand Already weeds are writing their scriptures in the sand We took the wrong step years ago We took the wrong step years ago We took the wrong step years ago The morning sun is rising, casting rays across the land Already nature's calling, take heed of the warning We took the wrong step years ago We took the wrong step years ago We took the wrong step years ago Think about the things that we should have done before The way that things are going the end is about to fall We took the wrong step years ago We took the wrong step years ago We took the wrong step years ago We took the wrong step years agoThe golden void speaks to me Denying my reality I lose my body, lose my mind I blow like wind, I flow like wine Down that corridor of flame Will I fly so high again Is there something wrong with me I cannot hear, I cannot see Down a corridor of flame Down a corridor of flame Down a corridor of flame Down a corridor of flame So you think the time is past The life you lead will always last Chaotic fusions of your soul Down below that rocky knoll Through the clouds an open sky The wind flows through your watering eyes The sounds are pitched to draw you on Your never-ending journey on The edge of time On the edge of time On the edge of time On the edge of time On the edge of time On the edge of time The edge of time
