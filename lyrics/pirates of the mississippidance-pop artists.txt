I'm standing at the crossroads in life, and I don't know where to go You know you've got my heart babe, but my music's got my soul Let me play it one more time, I'll tell the truth and make it rhyme And hope they understand me Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep If I die before I wake, feed Jake, he's been a good dog My best friend right through it all, if I die before I wake Feed Jake Now Broadway's like a sewer, bums and hookers everywhere Wino passed out on the sidewalk, doesn't anybody care Some say he's worthless, just let him be But I for one would have to disagree And so would their mamas Now I lay me down to sleep, and pray the Lord my soul to keep If I die before I wake, feed Jake, he's been a good dog My best friend right through it all, if I die before I wake Feed Jake Now If you get an ear pierced, some will call you gay But if you drive a pick-up, they'll say "No, you must be straight"What we are and what we ain't, what we can and what we can't Does it really matter Paroles de la chanson Honky Tonk Blues :Well, I left my home down on a rural route Told my folks I'm goin' steppin' out To get the honky tonk blues Yeah, the honky tonk blues Oh, Lord I got 'em I got the honky tonk blues I step into every place in town City life's really got me down I got the honky tonk blues Yeah, the honky tonk blues Oh, Lord I got 'em I got the honky tonk blues Instrumental Well, I went out last night, wore out my shoes Woke up this morning wishin' I could lose The jumpin' honky tonk blues Yeah, the honky tonk blues Oh, Lord I got 'em I got the honky tonk blues I'm gonna pack my worries underneath my arm And scatter right back to my pappy's farm And lose the honky tonk blues Yeah, the honky tonk blues Oh, Lord I've got 'em I got the honky tonk bluesChorus Rollin' home, rollin' home Been countin' down every single mile Of this road I'm on I got a sweet little baby that keeeps me Rollin' home Only been twelve days but it seems like a year I've seen America from ear to ear Picked up a load in San Angeline Dropped a transmission down in New Orleans Had the bird dog on dodgin' the scales Eight miles an hour and a step out of jail Quick cup of coffee and I'm back in the seat She told me that she loved me via A T&T Chorus Sometimes it seems like this ain't no life Truck stop showers and burgers and fries But I don't know what else I would do Got my education from Interstate U Gonna meet our friends on Saturday night And go dancin' down at Legion Post forty five Got a quarter acre mansion on the V A plan And we're building on a dream workin' hand and hand Chorus Tag:It's my sweet little that keeps me rollin' homeYa think theres someone else So today you're gonna leave But I went out alone I can't help what you beleive You Can't blame it all on me Chorus Speak of the devil He took me out again last night He got me drunk and he got me in a fight He was chasing women I was just there for the ride Speak of the devil He took me out again last night You say I had my chance And I did'nt change my ways Well It ain't all my fault But I still got hell to pay Well it feels like judgment day Chorus x 2I'm standing at the
