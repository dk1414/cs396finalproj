All that I do is dream Closing my eyes to see All that I do is cry Something inside has died Long Lost Feelings gone Into The ether Where nothing is wrongSo tell me something When did it end Where were you going Were we just friends I meant to tell you I wanted to say I'd really miss you If you went away Fall into nothing Drift into gray I am just wishing My days away I think of your touch Held your hand in mine I think of your lips Kiss me goodbye Send "Another Day" Ringtone to your CellIt's killing me This life that i live I said it's killing me ?  don't get what i ???And nobody said it was going to be so bad But it's killing me It's just driving me mad ?  i must walk you home And always know i won't Ever see your body next to mine Run my hands up and down your spine Feel your lips touching me Knowing what it feels like to be free It's killing me ?  seem so cruel I said it's killing me That you don't want me too And nobody wants to hear about it anymore And it's killing me That i just need ???So i must walk you home And alway know i won't Ever see your body next to mine Run my hands up and down your spine Feel your lips touching me Knowing what it feels like to be free Touching my soul inside Making me feel alive Taking away my pain Giving me a reason to wait For you For you For you For you For you For you For you For youHold me a little bit longer Take me somewhere else Tell me whatever you want to I'm such a fool for you Drive me just a little bit further And whisper what's on your mind Kiss me just a little bit longer Your sweet lips always making it harder To leave you when you know that I've got to go Just touch you now a little bit longer This world we made is full of wonder Take me now wherever you want to goAll that I do is dream Closing my eyes to see All that I do is cry Something inside has died Long Lost Feelings gone Into The ether Where nothing is wrongSo tell me something When did it end Where were you going Were we just friends I meant to tell you I wanted to say I'd really miss you If you went away Fall into nothing Drift into gray I am just wishing My days away I think of your touch Held your hand in mine I think of your lips Kiss me goodbye Send "Another Day" Ringtone to your CellIt's killing me This life that i live I said it's killing me ?  don't get what i ???And nobody said it was going to be so bad But it's killing me It's just driving me mad ?  i must walk you home And always know i won't Ever see your body next to mine Run my hands up and down your spine Feel your lips touching me Knowing what it feels like to be free It's killing me ?  seem so cruel I said it's killing me That you don't want me too And nobody wants to hear about it anymore And it's killing me That i just need ???So i must walk you home And alway know i won't Ever see your body next to mine Run my hands up and down your spine Feel your lips touching me Knowing what it feels like to be free Touching my soul inside Making me feel alive Taking away my pain Giving me a reason to wait For you For you For you For you For you For you For you For youHold me a little bit longer Take me somewhere else Tell me whatever you want to I'm such a fool for you Drive me just a little bit further And whisper what's on your mind Kiss me just a little bit longer Your sweet lips always making it harder To leave you when you know that I've got to go Just touch you now a little bit longer This world we made is full of wonder Take me now wherever you want to goAll that I do is dream Closing my eyes to see All that I do is cry Something inside has died Long Lost Feelings gone Into The ether Where nothing is wrongSo tell me something When did it end Where were you going Were we just friends I meant to tell you I wanted to say I'd really miss you If you went away Fall into nothing Drift into gray I am just wishing My days away I think of your touch Held your hand in mine I think of your lips Kiss me goodbye Send "Another Day" Ringtone to your Cell
