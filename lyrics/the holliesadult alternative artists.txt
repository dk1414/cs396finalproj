Saturday night I was downtown Working for the F BI Sittin' in a nest of bad men Whiskey bottles piling high Bootlegging boozer on the west side Full of people who are doing wrong Just about to call up the D A man When I heard this woman sing a song A pair of 45's made me open my eyes My temperature started to rise She was a long cool woman in a black dress Just-a 5'9, beautiful, tall With just one look I was a bad mess'Cause that long cool woman had it all I saw her heading to the table Like a tall walking big black cat When Charlie said I hope that you're able, boy Cause I'm telling you she knows where it's at Then suddenly we heard the sirens And everybody started to run A-jumping out of doors and tables When I heard somebody shootin' a gunThe road is long With many a winding turn That leads us to who knows where Who knows where But I'm strong Strong enough to carry him He ain't heavy, he's my brother So on we go His welfare is my concern No burden is he to bear We'll get there For I know He would not encumber me He ain't heavy, he's my brother If I'm laden at all I'm laden with sadness That everyone's heart Isn't filled with the gladness Of love for one another It's a long, long road From which there is no return While we're on the way to there Why not share And the load Doesn't weigh me down at all He ain't heavy, he's my brotherIf I could make a wish I think I'd pass Can't think of anythin' I need No cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound Nothing to eat, no books to read Making love with you Has left me peaceful, warm, and tired What more could I ask There's nothing left to be desired Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak So sleep, silent angel Go to sleep Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe And to love you All I need is the air that I breathe Yes, to love you All I need is the air that I breathe Peace came upon me And it leaves me weak So sleep, silent angel Go to sleepBus stop, wet day She's there, I say Please share my umbrella Bus stops, bus goes She stays, love grows Under my umbrella All that summer we enjoyed it Wind and rain and shine That umbrella, we employed it By August she was mine Every morning I would see her Waiting at the stop Sometimes she'd shop And she would show me what she'd bought All the people stared As if we were both quite insane Someday my name and hers Are going to be the same That's the way the whole thing started Silly but it's true Thinking of our sweet romance Beginning in a queue Came the sun The ice was melting No more sheltering now Nice to think that that umbrella Led me to a vowDoo doo doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo Hey, Carrie Anne Hey, Carrie Anne When we were at school, our games were simple I played the janitor, you played a monitor Then you played with older boys and prefects What's the attraction in what they're doing Hey Carrie Anne What's your game now, can anybody play Hey Carrie Anne What's your game now, can anybody play You were always something special to me Quite independent, never caring You lost your charm as you were aging Where is your magic disappearing Hey Carrie Anne What's your game now, can anybody play Hey Carrie Anne What's your game now, can anybody play You're so, so like a woman to me So, so like a woman to me I should be better off without you You take a pride in making me blue I'm telling you my friend It's got to be the end We're through I told you time and time again You told me he was just a friend But I found out some way I've seen him every day With you'Cause you never treat me tenderly You got no reason for leaving me'Cause I can't leave you alone'Cause I knew from the start You'd be tearing me apart Sooner or later'Cause you never treat me tenderly You got no reason for leaving me'Cause I can't leave you alone'Cause I knew from the start You'd be tearing me apart Sooner or laterRiding along on a carousel Trying to catch up to you Riding along on a carousel Will I catch up to you Horses chasing 'cause they're racing So near, yet so far On a carousel On a carousel Nearer, nearer by changing horses Still so far away People fighting for their places Just get in my way Soon you'll leave and then I'll lose you Still, we're going round On a carousel On a carousel{intro}See the girl with cymbals on her fingers Entering through the door Ruby glistening from her navel Shimmering around the floor Bells on feet go, ting a ling a linging Going through my head Sweat is falling just-a-like-a tear drops Running from her head Now she's dancing, going through the movements Swaying to and fro Body moving, bringing back a memory Thoughts of long ago Blood is rushing, temperature is rising Sweating from my brow Like a snake, her body fascinates me I can't look away now Stop, stop, stop all the dancing Give me time to breathe Stop, stop, stop all the dancing Or I'll have to leaveIf you could only see me I know exactly where I am You wouldn't want to be me Oh, I can assure you of that I'm not the guy to run with'Cause I'll throw you off the line I'll break you and destroy you Given time He's King Midas with a curse He's King Midas in reverse He's King Midas with a curse He's King Midas in reverse It's plain to see it's hopeless Going on the way we are So even though I'd lose you You'd be better off by farLook through any window, yeah What do you see Smilin' faces all around Rushin' through the busy town Movin' on their way Walkin' down the highways and the byways Movin' on their way People with their shy ways and their sly ways Oh, you can see the little children all around Oh, you can see the little ladies in their gowns when you Look through any window, yeah Any time of day See the drivers on the roads Pullin' down their heavy loads Movin' on their way Drivin' down highways and the byways Movin' on their way Drivers with their shy ways and their sly ways
