Yo, remember back on the Bully When cats used to harmonize like Yo, yo, my men and my women Don't forget about the deen Sirat al-Mustaqeem Yo, it's about a thing, uh, yo, yo If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air And lick two shots in the atmosphere!It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend The one you let hit it and never called you again'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins You act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend Like you wasn't down and you called him again Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem Baby girl, respect is just a minimum Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em Now, Lauryn is only human Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans Fake nails done by Koreans Come againYo, y-yo, yo, y-yo Yo, uh, yo, y-yo, yo, y-yo It could all be so simple But you'd rather make it hard Loving you is like a battle And we both end up with scars Tell me who I have to be To get some reciprocity See, no one loves you more than me And no one ever will Is this just a silly game That forces you to act this way  Forces you to scream my name Then pretend that you can't stay Tell me, who I have to be To get some reciprocity See, no one loves you more than me And no one ever willOne day, you're gonna understand Zion Unsure of what the balance held I touched my belly overwhelmed By what I had been chosen to perform But then an angel came one day Told me to kneel down and pray For unto me a man-child would be born Woe this crazy circumstance I knew his life deserved a chance But everybody told me to be smart"Look at your career," they said"Lauryn, baby use your head"But instead I chose to use my heart Now the joy of my world Is in Zion  Now the joy of my world Is in Zion  How beautiful if nothing more Than to wait at Zion's door I've never been in love like this before Now let me pray to keep you from The perils that will surely come See life for you, my prince has just begun And I thank you for choosing me To come through unto life to be A beautiful reflection of His grace See I know that a gift so great Is only one God could create And I'm reminded every time I see your faceIt's funny how money change a situation Miscommunication lead to complication My emancipation don't fit your equation I was on the humble, you on every station Some wan' play young Lauryn like she dumb But remember not a game new under the sun Everything you did has already been done I know all the tricks from Bricks to Kingston My ting done made your kingdom wan' run Now understand, L-Boogie, non-violent But if a thing test me, run for mi gun Can't take a threat to mi new born son L been this way since creation A groupie call, you fall from temptation Now you wanna bawl over separation Tarnish my image in the conversation Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion You might win some but you just lost one You might win some but you

You'd be like heaven to touch I wanna hold you so much At long last, love has arrived And I thank God I'm alive You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you Pardon the way that I stare There's nothing else to compare The sight of you leaves me weak There are no words left to speak But if you feel like I feel Please let me know that it's real You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you I need you, baby, and if it's quite alright I need you, baby, to warm a lonely night I love you, baby, trust in me when I say, "It's okay"Oh, pretty baby, don't let me

Tell him I love him And it'll be alright And tell him Tell him I need him Tell him I love him It'll be alright Now I may have faith  to make mountains fall But if I lack love, then I am nothin' at all I can give away  everything I possess But left without love then I have no happiness I know I'm imperfect , and not without sin But now that I'm older, all childish things end And tell him Oh, oh, oh Mmm, yeah, yeah Oh, oh Oh-oh, oh Oh yeah Oh, oh Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, oh, oh, oh Now the skies could fall Not even if my boss should call The world, it seems so very small'Cause nothing even matters at all See, nothing even matters See, nothing even matters at all Nothing even matters Nothing even matters at all See, I don't need no alcohol Your love make me feel ten feet tall Without it, I'd go through withdrawal'Cause nothing even matters at all Nothing even matters Nothing even matters at all Nothing even matters Nothing matters at allEverything is everything What is meant to be will be After winter must come spring Change, it comes eventually Everything is everything What is meant to be will be After winter must come spring Change, it comes eventually I wrote these words  for everyone who struggles in their youth Who won't accept deception in, instead of what is truth It seems we lose the game Before we even start to play Who made these rules  We're so confused Easily led astray Let me tell ya that...Everything is everything Everything is everything Everything is everything After winter must come spring Everything is everythingMy world, it moves so fast today The past, it seems so far away And life squeezes so tight that I can't breathe And every time I've tried to be what someone else has thought of me So caught up, I wasn't able to achieve But deep in my heart, the answer, it was in me And I made up my mind to define my own destiny I look at my environment And wonder where the fire went What happened to everything we used to be I hear so many cry for help Searching outside of themselves Now I know that His strength is within me And deep in my heart, the answer, it was in me And I made up my mind to define my own destiny And deep in my heart, the answer, it was in me And I made up my mind to define my own destinyIt's the mystery of iniquity Said it's the misery of Inequity Said it's the history of Inequity When it all, all falls down Telling you all, it all falls down Children, eat your bread Little children, eat your bread'Cause it all, all falls down Telling you all, it all falls down Yo  Y'all can't handle the truth in a courtroom of lies Perjures the jurors, witness despised Crooked lawyers, false indictments publicized It's entertainment, the arraignments, the subpoenas High profile gladiators in bloodthirsty arenas Enter the Dragon, black-robe crooked-balance Souls bought and sold and paroled for thirty talents Court reporter catch the circus on the paper File it in the system not acknowledged by the Maker Swearing by the bible blatantly blasphemous Publicly perpetrating that "In God We Trust"Cross-examined by a master manipulator The faster intimidator receiving the judge's favor Deceiving sabers doing injury to their neighbors For status, gratis, apparatus and legal waivers See the bailiff representing security Holding the word of God soliciting perjury The prosecution, political prostitution The more money you pay, the further away solution Legal actors, Babylon's benefactors Masquerading as the agency for the clients Hypocritical giants, morally non-compliant Orally armed to do bodily harm Polluted, recruited and suited judicial charm And the defense isn't making any sense Faking the confidence of escaping the consequence That a defendant is depending on the system Totally void of judgment purposely made to twist 'em Emotional victim blackmailed by the henchmen Framed by intentions Inventions whereby they lynch men Enter the false witness slandering the accused Planting the seed openly showing he's being used To discredit, edit, headed for the alleged Smearing the individual fearing the unsuspected Expert witness Made a priority to deceive the majority Of disinterested peers, dodging duty for years Hating the process, waiting to be returning to their careers Do we expect the system made for the elect To possibly judge correct  Properly serve and protect Materially corrupt, spiritually amuck Oblivious to the cause, prosperously bankrupt Blind leading the blind, guilty never defined Filthy as swine, a generation purin it's own mind Legal extortion, blown out of proportion In vein deceit, the truth is obsolete Only two positions: victimizer or victim Both end up in destruction trusting this crooked system Mafia with diplomas keeping us in a coma Trying to own a piece of the "American Corona"The Revolving Door, insanity every floor Skyscraping, paper chasing, what are we working for Empty traditions, reaching social positions Teaching ambition to support the family superstition When the Son of Perdition is Commander in Chief The standard is Thief; brethren, can we candidly speak Woe to the men, trusted in the chariots dem'Leaning on horses, they run their intellectual sources Counterfeit wisdom creating the illusion of freedom Confusion consumes them Every word they speak it turns them outwardly white Internally they absent of light Trapped in the night and bonded to the Cain of the night Under the curse, evil men waxing more worse Faxing the first, angelic being cast to the earth It's time for rebirth, burnin up the branch and the root The empty pursuits of every tree bearing the wrong fruit Turn and be healed, let him who stole, no longer steal Oh it's real, surrender for Jehovah is real How long will you sleep, troubled by the thoughts that Y OU keep The idols Y OU heap, causing the destruction you reap Judgment has come, find it and return to the One Abandon the flesh, self-interest: Broadway to death Pride and the Greed, hide and subdividing the seed The knowledge of Good and Evil is what caused us to lie Caused us to die, let your emotions be crucified Renounce all your thoughts Repent and let your mind be re-taught You'll find what you sought Was based on the deception you bought A perception of naught where the majority remains caught Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die
