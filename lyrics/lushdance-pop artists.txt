Here we go, I'm hanging out in Camden Drinking with my girlfriends on a Saturday night This guy says, "Come and meet my girlfriend"She's sitting in the corner looking rather uptight So I say hello and I try to be nice But I see he's feeling itchy Trying to play us off each other"Girls, girls, please don't fight"Hey you, the muscles and the long hair Telling me that women are superior to men Most guys just don't appreciate this You just try convincing me you're better than them So he talks for hours about his sensitive soul And his favourite subject is sex I don't even think he really wanted it But Christ, this guy's too much I'm as human as the next girl I like a bit of flattery But I don't need your practised lines Your school of charm mentality So save your breath for someone else And credit me with something more When it comes to men like you I know the score, I've heard it all beforeYou were a bridge, I didn't wanna burn There goes that bridge, I had to watch it burn Wish you had done what you said would, ooh But I sleep easy knowing that I did all that I could You didn’t 'preciate me The only one there You didn't ’preciate me No matter how much I care I couldn't save you from yourself There's moments I hate you I still don't want no one else I couldn't save you, ohh-ohh, oh no I couldn't save you, ohh-ohh'Cause you couldn't save yourself, mhm, hmm I don’t stop myself when I’m thinkin' about ya You put me through hell just to keep me thinking ’bout ya My vision's getting blurry but I still want to see you Why did you make me promise that I would never leave you You didn't 'preciate me The only one there You didn’t 'preciate me No matter how much I care I couldn't save you from yourself There's moments I hate you I still don't want no one else I couldn't save you, ooh-ooh, oh no I couldn't save you, ooh-ooh'Cause you couldn't save yourself, ohh-oh-ohRemember when we were young Breakin' every rule they made I'll never change what we've done It made us who we are today I've takin' every chance I get To make it so you won't forget Who we are, who we are This is what we started This is what we started They can't hold us down They'll never be, never be Never be, never be us This is what we started Remember we used to run To the corner of 69th Yeah, they would come chasin' us We found a new place to hide How makin' our plans to break out Give me your hand and they They will know who we areTake it slowly'Cause it feels like time has got something to show me Through a crowded room, look at me like you know me Ain't it funny how a second lasts forever When we're together And I-I-I might get enough one day But I-I-I won't let this feeling fade away I know it won't stop if we turn our love up Why should we change  We were amazing yesterday Remove the pressure and if it's meant forever I'll make you stay, don't let this feeling fade away Won't let this feeling fade away Don't you hurry I will show you all the treasures that I buried Try to hide but you just always see right through me Sometimes I feel like giving up but you're the reason That I'm not leavin'Pretty little girl, she shines Knowing she is young, she smiles Happy just to be a prize Happy just to see his smile Silly little girl, she tries Thinking she is good and wise Doesn't recognise the lies Pouring from her lips, she sighs This is so real It's what I feel I look in your eyes And lose myself Silly little girl denies Ever understanding why Her face is full of sad surprise Every time she hears him cry What do you feel When you're with me I look in your eyes And see myselfHere we go, I'm hanging out in Camden Drinking with my girlfriends on a Saturday night This guy says, "Come and meet my girlfriend"She's sitting in the corner looking rather uptight So I say
