All day Starin' at the ceilin', makin'Friends with shadows on my wall All night Hearin' voices tellin' me That I should get some sleep Because tomorrow might be good for somethin'Hold on Feelin' like I'm headed for a Breakdown And I don't know why But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell I know right now you can't tell But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see A different side of me I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired I know right now you don't care But soon enough you're gonna think of me And how I used to be Me I'm talkin' to myself in public And dodgin' glances on the train And I know I know they've all been talkin' 'bout me I can hear them whisper And it makes me think there must be somethin' wrongShe said, "It's cold outside" and she hands me a raincoat She's always worried about things like that She said, "It's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault"And she only sleeps when it`s raining And she screams, and her voice is straining And she says, "Baby, it's three A M, I must be lonely"And she says, "Baby, well, I can't help But be scared of it all sometimes And the rain's gonna wash away, I believe this"She's got a little bit of something, God, it's better than nothing And in her color portrait world she believes that she's got it all She swears that the moon don't hang quite as high as it used to And she only sleeps when it's raining And she screams and her voice is straining And she says, "Baby, when it's three A M I must be lonely"Well, heaven she says, "Baby, well, I can't help But be scared of it all sometimes And the rain's gonna wash away, I believe this" I don't know if I've ever been good enough I'm a little bit rusty, and I think my head is caving in And I don't know if I've ever been really loved By a hand that's touched me, well I feel like something's Gonna give And i'm a little bit angry, well This ain't over, no not here, not while I still need you Around You don't owe me, we might change Yeah we just might feel good I wanna push you around, I will, I will I wanna push you down, I will, I will I wanna take you for granted, I wanna take you for granted I will I don't know why you ever would lie to me Like I'm a little untrusting when I think that the truth is Gonna hurt ya And I don't know why you couldn't just stay with me You couldn't stand to be near me When my face don't seem to want to shine'Cause it's a little bit dirty, wellHello, hello, hello I'm waking up at the start of the end of the world But its feeling just like every other morning before Now I wonder what my life is going to mean if it's gone The cars are moving like a half a mile an hour at that I started staring at the passengers who're waving goodbye Can you tell me what was ever really special about me all this time But I believe the world is burning to the ground Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out Let's see how far we've come Let's see how far we've come Well I, believe, it all, is coming to an end Oh well, I guess, we're gonna pretend Let's see how far we've come Let's see how far we've come I think it turned ten o'clock but I don't really know Then I can't remember caring for an hour or so Started crying and I couldn't stop myself I started running but there's no where to run to I sat down on the street and took a look at myself Said where you going man you know the world is headed for hell Say your goodbyes if you've got someone you can say goodbye toI think I've already lost you I think you're already gone I think I'm finally scared now You think I'm weak, I think you're wrong I think you're already leavin'Feels like your hand is on the door I thought this place was an empire Now I'm relaxed, I can't be sure And I think you're so mean, I think we should try I think I could need this in my life and I think I'm scared, I think too much I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealin'If you're gone Maybe it's time to come home There's an awful lot of breathin' room But I can hardly move If you're gone Baby, you need to come home, come home There's a little bit of somethin' me In everything in youWell I wonder what it's like to be a rainmaker I wonder what it's like to know that I made the rain I'd store it in boxes with little yellow tags on every one You can come and see them when I'm ..  done When I'm done I wonder what it's like to be a superhero I wonder where I'd go if I could fly around downtown, yeah From some other planet, I'd get this funky high on a yellow sun Boy, I bet my friends will all be ..  stunned They're stunned Yeah!Straight up, what did you hope to learn about here If I was someone else would it all fall apart Strange, where were you when we started this gig I wish the real world would just stop hassling me Do you Do you And meIt's nothing, it's so normal You just stand there I could say so much But I don't go there because I don't want to I was thinking if you were lonely Maybe we could leave here and no one would know At least not to the point that we would think so Everyone here, knows everyone here is thinking about Somebody else Well, it's best if we all keep this under our heads I couldn't tell, if anyone here was feeling the way I do But I'm lonely now And I don't know how To get it back to good This don't mean that, you own me, well This ain't no good, in fact it's phony as hell Yeah, but things worked out just like you wanted too If you see me out, you don't know me Try to turn your head, try to give me some room Oh, to figure out just what I'm going to doAnd if I fall along the way Pick me up and dust me off And if I get too tired to make it Be my breath so I can walk And if I need some other love, then Give me more than I can stand And when my smile gets old and faded Wait around, I'll smile again Shouldn't be so complicated Just hold me and then Oh, just hold me again Can you help me I'm bent I'm so scared that I'll never Get put back together Keep breaking me in And this is how we will end With you and me bent And if I couldn't sleep, could you sleep Could you paint me better off And could you sympathize with my needs I know you think I need a lotI kn-kn-know a girl, she gets what she wants all the time Cause she's fine But for an angel, she's a hot hot mess Make you so blind, but you don't mind Cause she's an uptown, get-around, anything-goes girl, girl She's a hardcore, candy-store,

she wrote That I can't bring myself to throw away And also Reach, she said, for no one else but you'Cause you won't turn away When someone else is gone I'm sorry about the attitude I need to give when I'm with you But no one else'll take this shit from me And I'm so terrified of no one else but me I'm here all the time I won't go away Yeah, hey, it's me Yeah, well, I can't get myself to go away
