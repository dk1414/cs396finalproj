Cruel, cruel world, must I go on Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on I've been living too fast And I've been living too wrong Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone This big ol' world sure got me running 'round I heard a voice that said, "Just settle down"And with the moonlight as my guide And with this feeling deep inside I know now that I am homeward bound Cruel, cruel world, must I go on Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on I've been living too fast And I've been living too wrong Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone Desert roads, desert plains I have seen so much pain Now I see into the eyes of a girl No more, no more, cruel worldOne two One two three four On the road again Just can't wait to get on the road again The life I love is making music with my friends And I can't wait to get on the road again On the road again Goin' places that I've never been Seein' things that I may never see again And I can't wait to get on the road again On the road again Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway We're the best of friends Insisting that the world keep turning our way And our way Is on the road again I just can't wait to get on the road again The life I love is makin' music with my friends And I can't wait to get on the road againLiving on the road, my friend Was gonna keep you free and clean And now you wear your skin like iron Your breath as hard as kerosene You weren't your momma's only boy But her favorite one, it seems She began to cry when you said goodbye And sank into your dreams Pancho was a bandit boy His horse was fast as polished steel He wore his gun outside his pants For all the honest world to feel Pancho met his match, you know On the deserts down in Mexico Nobody heard his dying words But that's the way it goes All the Federales say They could've had him any day They only let him slip away Out of kindness, I suppose Lefty, he can't sing the blues All night long like he used to The dust that Pancho bit down South Ended up in Lefty's mouth The day they laid poor Pancho low Lefty split for Ohio Where he got the bread to go There ain't nobody knowsNow, many, many years ago when I was twenty-three I was married to a widow who was pretty as could be This widow had a grown-up daughter, had hair of red My father fell in love with her and soon the two were wed This made my dad my son-in-law and changed my very life My daughter was my mother 'cause she was my father's wife To complicate the matter, even though it brought me joy I soon became the father of a bouncing baby boy My little baby then became the brother-in-law to Dad And so became my uncle though it made me very sad For if he was my uncle, that also made him the brother Of the widow's grown-up daughter who of course was my step-mother I'm my own grandpa I'm my own grandpa It sounds funny, I know, but it really is so For I'm my own grandpa My father's wife then had a son that kept him on the run And he became my grandchild for he was my daughter's son My wife is now my mother's mother and it makes me blue Because she is my wife, she's my grandmother tooCowboys ain't easy to love And they're harder to hold They'd rather give you a song Than diamonds or gold Lonestar belt buckles and old faded Levis And each night begins a new day If you don't understand him and he don't die young He'll probably just ride away Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys'Cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone Even with someone they love Cowboys like smoky old pool rooms And clear mountain mornings Little warm puppies and children And girls of the night Them that don't know him Won't like him and them that do Sometimes won't know how to take him He ain't wrong, he's just different But his pride won't let him Do things to make you think he's rightMaybe I didn't love you Quite as often as I could have Maybe I didn't treat you Quite as good as I should have If I made you feel second best Girl, I'm sorry I was blind You were always on my mind You were always on my mind And maybe I didn't hold you All those lonely, lonely times And I guess I never told you I'm so happy that you're mine Little things I should have said and done I just never took the time And you were always on my mind You were always on my mind Tell me, tell me that your Sweet love hasn't died And give me Give me one more chance To keep you satisfied Keep you satisfiedIn the twilight glow I see them Blue eyes crying in the rain When we kissed goodbye and parted I knew we'd never meet again Love is like a dying ember And only memories remain And through the ages I'll remember Blue eyes crying in the rain Some day when we meet up yonder We'll stroll hand-in-hand again In a land that knows no parting Blue eyes crying in the rain Now my hair has turned to silver All my life I've loved in vain I can see her star in heaven Blue eyes crying in the rainLaugh with me, buddy, jest with me, buddy Don't let her get the best of me, buddy Don't ever let me start feeling lonely If I ever needed you, buddy You know now I really do, buddy Don't ever let me start feeling lonely I cry at the least, little thing, buddy And I'll die if you mention her name, buddy Talk to me, buddy, stay with me, buddy Let's don't let her get away with it, buddy Don't ever let me start feeling lonely Let's talk about things as they were, buddy Before I got mixed up with her, buddy Laugh with me, buddy, jest with me, buddy Let's don't let her get the best of me, buddy Don't ever let me start feeling lonelyWell, it’s all going to pot Whether we like it or not Best  I can tell The world’s gone to hell And we’re sure gonna miss it a lot All

land under starry skies above Don't fence me in Let me ride through the wide open country that I love Don't fence me in Let me be by myself in the evening breeze Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees Oh give me land lots of land under starry skies above Don't fence me in Let me ride through the wide open country that I love Don't fence me in Just turn me loose let me straddle my old saddle Underneath the western skies On my cayuse let me wander over yonder'Till I see the mountains rise I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences Gaze at the moon until I lose my senses Oh give me land lots of land under starry skies above Don't fence me in Let me ride through the wide open country that I love Don't fence me in
