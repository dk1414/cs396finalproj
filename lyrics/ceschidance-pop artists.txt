For every bicycle in China there's a Cryogenically frozen embryo That will Wake up in a cold sweat Run around the veteran's hospital Wondering what gave birth to it Then we'll sing the national anthem While the government rounds up zygotes In the latest titanium nets So they will keep their baby mouths shut And suck down freedom with the other runts But I'm an impostor here I feel it in my bones And in the way that I have never cared About American hope Yes, you're an anomaly just like me So let's fuck in the street To show them what it's like to be free You'll give birth on a highway With fifty frozen babies on all sides Curled up in their ice cube wombs Sweet, closed eyed We'll come up with their names one by one Till every letter's used And they've thawed out in the sun"Say something meaningful please"It's been 3 years of stagnation, court dates, and fees Wondering if I will go free Nothing will satisfy me Even if I burn this whole planet down it seems Won't learn a thing I'll die from risking I've got friends who would rather end society Because there's no way of fixing these flaws And that's starting to make far more sense to me now Cause we're lazy and used to what's wrong It's been embedded inside us since our first breaths We're destroying the world where we live But I'm sitting here watching a T.V  in bed Wondering why I lack happiness Oh disappointing mouth Say something more than Another word about How's your life's difficult Now!La la la la la la Every single breath that I've taken has created me Endless thank you's to the women who raised me Try to keep my head cool though life keeps burning me Sorry that I never learned how to respect authority, forgive me Mother I swear that I'm a grown man You taught me how to walk holding my pinky in your hand30 years later, bearded, ready for whatever They can hold me down for now but this won't last forever Promise I'll be back and better Fallen 40 stories only bled Been trampled down and beaten, left for dead Gambled and I lost Gambled and I won Don't think that i would ever take those bets back, none From the bottom of my heart I believe in what we're doing And don't care if it's unattainable I'll still pursue it Oh my God I'm sorry for the sins that I was born with But a life without a single sin is simply boring Forgive me Any minute now all could be gone But I know together we're strong Any minute now all could be gone Stay strong Stay strongYeah Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall Some will fight for survival Very few will stand tall Yeah yeah Nothing lasts too long I'm not advanced I'm no Kurzweil Just a man And I'm flawed Let's play pretend Bend Move it on beyond your body transcend I am just a broken version of the perfect person searching for some type of affordable plastic surgeon to solder these wires properly Honestly, I bought a million vitamins in the hopes that they might mend my endless flaws Amino acid concoctions That claimed that they would make me calm I wish I could've been a better person When it actually meant something Not now These retrospective reflections won't reverse my errors Just an endless apology follows me stuck on repeatYou swear you've heard it before as it slowly rambles on No need in bringing it back cause' they've never really gone I met this girl named Araceli In her car and on her celly a sullen girl Always jealous of Kelly And Kelly her sister Behind that building I kissed her But I couldn't get her Out of her kelly green sweater Besides I like my baby Barb from feather Even though my baby Betty Was better in bed Helen and Evelyn Would be at Seven-Eleven at around Eleven With her friend Gwendelyn Gwendelyn looks like Glenda without the melanin And more like Marilyn From the University of Maryland She's a Terrapin Her and Tara are friends And Tara's a ten But she's terribly into trends And trendy's not the way to be If it were Wendy I took her to Wendy's When it's windy And we pretend we And we loan each other fetty' but she never seem to pay me back it don't offend me Let me tell you bout' the time I dated Emmy We went to the Emmy's And we were faded off of Remy They gave a Emmy To Jennifer playing Penny And another one to Michael Mc Kean for playing Lenny And let me end this off by saying women drive me insane From Ryan finding and crying up on me in the rain I'm sorry I'll try my best to maintain my sanity afterwards if you look like a He apologized to the folks in the back row who got splattered in blood at the last show He apologized for the spit and sweat that dripped off of his skin and his chest, but none the less He should have apologized for things that he never did when he should, and things that he did when he shouldn't Of all those sins that gathered up to form a fifty foot dragon sleeping in a labyrinth inside of his brain cavity stagnant GG Allin threatened to blow out his brains on the stage, but when death day came it was quiet and tame And there's the one about the girl in Berlin who jumped out a window when her people convinced her suicide was performance Bad jokes about bad people in bad bars make the bad worse and make the good crash cars So have you heard the one about the one man band I heard he sang like an angel before he hanged So have you heard the one about the one man band, yes the one man band Yeah, I heard it...But it's too soon to laugh about his follies in the past About the way that he got fat and couldn't keep it in his pants And I remember lies about five figure record deals Headlining bills and lines when he tried to convince me everything was real But it was a crying shame seeing him lye in pain after realizing the way he wasted time and again They dangled the prize in front of his tired eyes like arcade toy cranes with no claws to play He used to sing, "god damn another one of God's bad jokes"When he stabs and pokes at her last hopes We were young once, we wrote songs about not giving a fuck, acting like we had some guts Laughing on a bar stool dumb, drunk, his one hand fiddled with some nuts while the other held the mug And every crease in his face was a fault line that looked like it had been drawn there at the beginning of time But he was only 45 when he died with no family left behind, just instruments and a mic And the story goes that he cried like a baby as he tied the noose waiting for someone to come and save himOn the road again -That was a reference to Cormac Mc Carthy Thirty-three, still singing "Fuck the Police"While the mark of the beast Surrounds me through targeted marketing Awfully ominous, aren't we I'ma be honest with all of these zombies Making a mockery out of humanity Thinking that a meme is a revolutionary strategy Please try to dream Bigger than a five inch screen And I'll fight and scream Even if they don't hear me Never wanted to be anything better than anybody Only want to think up possibilities for everybody Getting a little more free But we're still trapped in a prison of debt Because of corporate greed That's gangster shit Keep most poor while the few stay rich They tell me, "That's how it is"But I want to believe in more than this Been a captain of a slow sinking ship Got locked up 'cause a motherfucker never snitched Life can change so quick Grandpas gone, little brother had a kid Still singing these songs Don't know how to quit They tell me that I got a Peter Pan complex Heading to my middle age, not grown yet If growing up means settling for the least evil in a race between rats I don't know about that I don't know about thatI'll spend this lifetime fighting something Even if I have no idea what I want to prove Keep wasting all your precious moments Working hard to not work at all just for a fantasy Even if every goal is impossible And even if freedom's not feasible I break these bones hoping to find it There's no logic here It is wild, it is grimy Fight like hell Whether in prison or with our dying breath Don't snitch and don't tell Fight like hell, fight like hell Fight like hell Be realistic, kill your delusions Grow up or get married, buy life insurance And without illusions there's no dreaming Only sensory input and smug self-assurance Like any of us could let go of the feeling That common decency might lead us all straight into prison Or to death Like anybody else in the world has a better waste of breath You better have my money when I come to collectI am a product of catholic school ruler beatings Suspensions and foolish cheating If I mention the ascension of Christ in a sentence I'm probably kidding This is a song about confronting my demons And leading them back into undeveloped regions of my brain So the sequences stop repeating On the phone Abuela tells me "dios te bendiga"But I feel like God took back his blessings Ever since the moment I started breathing And seeing the lack of validity surrounding all this mythology fed to me Fuck it, even if I wanted to believe I could never make a false god into my centerpiece When I was an altar boy I saw Father Pat drinking wine out of bottles in the back I saw that fucker Brother Rich get fired for touching little kids during after school class And when i heard that Father Conrad died of A ID S in 1990 I started realizing that I couldn't trust my church entirely Mother Superior jumped the gun In the name of the Father, the Holy Ghost and the Son I present a toast to the nuns Falling in bad jokes like that one What's black and white and red all over Hope is all doneBright light Incesticide Forgiveness is powerful There’s a bright light States they Crucify Believers in something bigger That bright light Back in the day the sun it shone brightly2018 feel like Sans Soleil We’re facing mistakes Remember to pump breaks Wash all the gun taste From out of our mouths I used to walk like a samurai Was taught that I had to die Now I’m drunk on the floor In Austin As Awesome As fantasized In vibe with the morning star I’ve seen the greatest of minds violently torn apart silently Dynasties died Grinding the ivories I pine to be Reminded of minor chords Rewound too far Now we dine with the dinosaurs Was tight Till we noticed The buttons broke Now I'm stuck on this boat And I don't fuck with coke
