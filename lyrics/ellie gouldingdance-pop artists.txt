the first time Running all the red lights The middle finger was our peace sign, yeah We were sipping on emotions Smoking and inhaling every moment It was reckless and we owned it, yeah, yeah We were high and we were sober We were on and we were over We were young and now I'm older But I'd do it all again Getting drunk on a train track Way back, when we tried our first cigarettes Ten dollars was a fat stack I'd do it all again Bomber jacket and a snapback Your dad's black Honda was a Maybach "Re: Stacks" on the playback I'd do it all again We were lovers on a wild ride Speeding for the finish line Come until the end of our time, yeah Started off as a wildfire Burning down the bridges to our empire Our love was something they could admire, yeah, yeahEven though we both know we're liars And we start each other's fires We just know that we'll be alright Even though we're kicked out the party'Cause we both hate everybody We're the ones they wanna be like So don't let me down Keep me in trouble Born to be wild Out in the jungle And I don't wanna be somebody without your body Close to me And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody Close to me 'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al like Animal like you And I don't wanna be somebody without your body Close to me You can never come too close for comfort I had to cut my bitch off, she bein' stubborn I make it known I fuck with you, not undercover And when I jump in, I'm burnin' rubber Iced out body, didn't go to college Price tag poppin', then you on a private Don't say sorry, everyone's watchin' When you're where I am, everything's timeless We We don't have to worry 'bout nothing'Cause we got the fire And we're burning one hell of a something They They're gonna see us from outer space, outer space Light it up Like we're the stars of the human race, human race When the light started out They don't know what they heard Strike the match, play it loud Giving love to the world We'll be raising our hands Shinin' up to the sky'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire And we're gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn We're gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn We're gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burnI had a way then Losin' it all on my own I had a heart then But the queen has been overthrown And I'm not sleepin' now The dark is too hard to beat And I'm not keepin' up The strength I need to push me You show the lights that stop me turn to stone You shine it when I'm alone And so I tell myself that I'll be strong And dreaming when they're gone'Cause they're callin', callin', callin' me home Callin', callin', callin' home You show the lights that stop me turn to stone You shine it when I'm alone Noises, I play within my head Touch my own skin And hope that I'm still breathin'And I think back to when My brother and my sister slept In an unlocked place The only time I feel safeFire and ice This love is like fire and ice This love is like rain and blue skies This love is like sun on the rise This love got me rolling the dice Don't let me lose Still falling for you Still falling for you Beautiful mind Your heart got a story with mine Your heart got me hurting at times Your heart gave me new kind of highs Your heart got me feeling so fine So what to do Still falling for you Still falling for you It took us a while With every breath a new day With love on the line We've had our share of mistakes But all your flaws and scars are mine Still falling for you Still falling for youMm Mm How long will I love you As long as stars are above you And longer if I can How long will I need you As long as the seasons need to Follow their plan How long will I be with you As long as the sea is bound to Wash up on the sand How long will I want you As long as you want me to And longer by far How long will I hold you As long as your father told you As long as you canI know that I've been messed up You never let me give up All the nights and the fights And the blood and the breakups You're always there to call up I'm a pain, I'm a child, I'm afraid But yeah, you understand Yeah like no one can I know that we don't look like much But no one fucks it up like us16 and you never even judged me Matter of fact I always thought you were too cool for me Sitting there in the caravan All the nights we've been drunk on the floor And yeah you understand Yeah like no one can We both know what they say about us But they don't stand a chance because When I'm with you When I'm with you I'm standing with an army I'm standing with an army When I'm with you When I'm with you I'm standing with an army Standing with an army
