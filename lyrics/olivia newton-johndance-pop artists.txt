for you But baby, can't you see There's nothing else for me to do I'm hopelessly devoted to you But now there's nowhere to hide Since you pushed my love aside I'm out of my head Hopelessly devoted to you Hopelessly devoted to you Hopelessly devoted to you My head is saying, "Fool, forget him"My heart is saying, "Don't let go Hold on 'til the end"And that's what I intend to do I'm hopelessly devoted to youWe go together like Ramma lamma lamma ka dinga da dinga dong Remembered forever as Shoo-wop sha whada whadda yippidy boom da boom Chang chang, changity chang shoo bop That's the way it should be Wah-ooo, yeah!We're one of a kind Like dip da dip da dip do wop di dooby do Our names are signed Like boogy boogy boogy boogy shooby do wop she bop Chang chang, changity chang shoo bop We'll always be like one Wa-wa-wa-one When we go out a night And stars are shining bright Up in the skies above Or at the high school dance Where you can find romance Maybe it might be lo-uh-uh-uh-uh-veLook at me, there has to be Something more than what they see Wholesome and pure Oh so scared and unsure A poor man's Sandra Dee Sandy, you must start anew Don't you know what you must do Hold your head high Take a deep breath and sigh"Goodbye to Sandra Dee..."Wherever you go Wherever you may wander in your life Surely you know I'll always wanna be there Holding your hand And standing by to catch you when you fall Seeing you through In everything you do Let me be there in your morning Let me be there in your night Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right Let me take you through that wonderland That only two can share All I ask you is let me be there Watching you grow And going through the changes in your life That's how I know I'll always wanna be there Whenever you feel you need a friend to lean on, here I am Whenever you call, you know I'll be thereA place where nobody dared to go The love that we came to know They call it Xanadu And now, open your eyes and see What we have made is real We are in Xanadu A million lights are dancing And there you are, a shooting star An everlasting world And you're here with me, eternally Xanadu Xanadu In Xanadu Xanadu Xanadu In Xanadu Xanadu, your neon lights will shine For you, XanaduCome take my hand You should know me I've always been in your mind You know I will be kind I'll be guiding you Building your dream Has to start now There's no other road to take You won't make a mistake I'll be guiding you You have to believe we are magic Nothin' can stand in our way You have to believe we are magic Don't let your aim ever stray And if all your hopes survive Destiny will arrive I'll bring all your dreams alive For you I'll bring all your dreams alive For youDo we deserve a second chance How did we fall into this circumstance We weren't so straight and narrow This is much more than we deserve A higher voice has called the tune Two hearts that lost the beat will now resume The gift of life extension By divine intervention Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh It's gotta be a strange twist of fate Telling me that heaven can wait Telling me to get it right this time Life doesn't mean a thing Without the love you bring Love is what we've found The second time around Don't understand what's going on Woke up this morning, all the hurt was gone This is a new beginning I'm back in the land of the living
