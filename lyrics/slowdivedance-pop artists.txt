hits, she'll be waiting With her cool things and her heaven Hey hey, lover, you still burn me You're a sun, yeah There's a blizzard of gulls They're drumming in the wind Only lovers alive Running in the dark Anna rolled away Said we never wanted much Just a rollercoast'Our love was never number one Sugar for the pill You know it's just the way things are Can't abide the sun This jealousy will break the whole Cut across the sky And move a little closer now Lying in a bed of greed You know I had the strangest dream Anna rolled away Said we never wanted much Just a rollercoast'Our love was never number one Sugar for the pill You know it's just the way things are Can't abide the sun This jealousy will break the wholeListen close and don't be stoned I'll be here in the morning'Cause I'm just floating Your cigarette still burns Your messed-up world will thrill me Alison, I'm lost"Alison," I said, "We're sinking"There's nothing here but that's okay Outside your room, your sister's spinning But she lies, tells me she's just fine I guess she's out there somewhere And the sailors, they strike poses TV covered walls End so slowly With your talking and your pills Your messed-up life still thrills me Alison, I'm lostSee you walking and I know she's my friend again Just the weight of the water drags me down again Guess I'll think of the water, it's my friend, oh yeah It's just the way that the water makes me feel again Son of Sheba, I saw him drown Son of yellow, I saw him down It's all I need, yeah See you walking and I know she's my friend again Just the weight of the water drags me down again Guess I'll think of the water, it's my friend, oh yeah It's just the way that the water makes me feel again Son of Sheba, I saw him drown Son of yellow, I saw him down It's all I need, yeahClosed doors Brings open minds See you smile Inside Faces And I've fallen Wonder why I'm here now In asylum Don't you see In asylum Don't you see Doors close And feelings flow Through my mind I feel his Pictures And I've fallen Wonder why I'm here nowYou give me your love, it's a curious love You give me your heart, it's a curious thing Our lady of the shipwreck is running through the storm With her skirts blown back Hands to the fore My love and I go, it's a curious woe Like dreamers at dawn, awake but not yet You gimme your heart, it's a curious thing Gimme your love, it's a curious love It burns and it slides It's a curious ride Gimme your heart, yeah Gimme your heart My love and I go, yeah, it's a curious ride We're younger than clouds Younger than cloudsThe sunshine girl is sleeping She falls and dreams alone And me, I am her dagger Too numb to feel her pain The world is full of noise, here I hear it all the time And me, I am your dagger You know I am your wound I thought I heard you whisper It happens all the time I thought I heard you whisper It happens all the time She whispers while I'm sleeping:"I love you when you smile"I didn't really lose you I just lost it for a while The world is full of noise, yeah I hear it all the time You know I am your dagger You know I am your wound I thought I heard you whisper It happens all the time I thought I heard you whisper It happens all the timeI can see you laughing Through dreams of perfect sleep Sleep away from me You know what's in my mind When you go I'm crying Dream, dream away from me Let the Lord embrace you Bow down and spare the reed When I close my eyes Your fate shall be free When I see you drowning I'll dream, dream away from youGive it away now, girl Can't hold down tonight Every black and white Secret's a blinking light Emma flies a kite Said she's feeling love for everyone tonight Although possible Said she's feeling good, said she's feeling good Smiling beautiful She says I make it best For everyone to hide Twisting around my girl Nothing left to lose Nothing left to fight Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Ooh, oohForty days and I miss you I'm so high that I've lost my mind It's the summer I'm thinking of Forty days and I'm blown away If I saw something new I guess I wouldn't worry If I saw something new I guess I wouldn't care You said you're always sleeping But if so, I'll be leaving It's just that I'm always falling And it makes me feel bad, yeah If I saw something new I guess I wouldn't worry If I saw something new I guess I wouldn't care Just to try and watch you Said I love the way that you smile I don't know Makes me try and watch you I said I love the way that you smile I don't know Smile whenever I watch you I said I love the way that you smile I don't know Smile whenever I watch you I said I love the way that you smile I don't know
