sword Sharp to East Her magnitude That made the table In an infinite tangle And then the darkness came And wrapped on velvet feet And here through the window I saw a quickening eye Reflecting time In the blowing night And pulled the shade To a clear green game And from the visions Riding heavy sea And from the visions Riding heavy sea That cast the ships Into a sink as man And burn the ringing
