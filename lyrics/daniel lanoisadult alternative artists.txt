The many miles we walked The many things we learned The building of a shrine Only just to burn May the wind be at your back Good fortune touch your hand May the cards lay out a straight All from your command That's the way it is That’s the way it is That's the way it is That's the way it is Blue heron leaves the northern sky Trusts the journey to new heights What’s the meaning of the scar If we don't know how to heal Should we ever be apart Then how does it feel That's the way it is That's the way it is That's the way it is That's the way it isI'm going to where the sun burns And the heat stays in command Come and lay by my side Right here To where the river turns to dust And God is never rushed Come and lay by my side Right here Red, I love you and the world It seemed to make sense When Brother Santo said One more run be enough Going to be enough Money for everything Silver-toed boots and kerosene Come and lay by my side Right here Red, I love you and the worldOh, oh deep water Black and cold like the night I stand with arms wide open I've run a twisted line I'm a stranger In the eyes of the maker I could not see for the fog in my eyes I could not feel for the fear in my life And from across the great divide In the distance I saw a light Jean Baptiste Walking to me with the maker My body is bent and broken By a long and dangerous sleep I can't work the Fields of Abraham And turn my head away I'm not a stranger In the hands of the maker Brother John Have you seen the homeless daughters Standing there with broken wings I have seen the flaming swords There over east of Eden Burning in the eyes of the maker Burning in the eyes of the maker Burning in the eyes of the maker Burning in the eyes of the makerEvery chip from every cup Every promise given up Every reason that's not enough Is falling, falling at your feet Every band elastic limit Every race when there's nothing in it Every winner that's lost a ticket Is falling, falling at your feet I've come crawling, falling at your feet Everyone who needs a friend Every life that has no end Every knee not ready to bend Is falling, falling at your feet I've come crawling, now I'm falling at your feet All fall down All fall down All fall down All fall down Every teenager with acne Every face that's spoiled by beauty Every adult tamed by duty They're all falling at your feetSad eyes, sad eyes Where you going with that confidence Sad eyes, sad eyes Where you going with that confidence I'm going to where the boats go by Calidonia river flow so wide I'm going to where the boats go by Calidonia river flow so wide Still water, laying over Still water, laying over Still water, laying over Calidonia river oh so wide Wild eyes in the wilderness Where you going with the devil in hand Wild eyes in the wilderness Where you going with the devil in hand I'm going to build the bridges high For working money, for working money I'm going to climb the bridges high Calidonia brother far away Still water, I'm laying over Still water, lay my body down over Still water, laying over Calidonia river far awayY a quelqu'un qui appelle mon nom Y a quelqu'un qui appelle mon nom On travail aujourd'hui, on
