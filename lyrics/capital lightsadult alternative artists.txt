He met her up in Delaware in 1937 She was wearing red lipstick To match her pretty dress December 24 at a quarter till 11:00's When he finally gained the courage To ask her to dance It was the night before Christmas It was love at first sight The carolers sang as they danced through the night She was a small town girl He was a traveling guy He never caught her name before they said their goodbyes A couple years later He was out on the road Having Christmas dinner in a diner alone When he saw a young waiteress with a gleam in her eye Her favorite day of the year She showed her spirits were high She said, "Sir, can you shed a little holiday cheer "A simple Christmas story's all she wanted to hear He looked prepared with a smile as he started to say"Here's my favorite Christmas story 'bout a girl with no name."On an empty stomach again, hard to eat with no appetite Well I've never been one to spill my guts so, I got a lot bottled inside Behind this face is a wasted space, wanna kiss this brain goodbye So, I'm pretty eager to share my thoughts, let me give you a piece of my mind There's a jungle in my head I admit that I'm scared, scared to commit But if it's love you seek, don't give up on me just yet Don't drop dead, Juliet, keep a stiff upper lip Blow a kiss so hard it awakens love in the soul of this heartbreak kid Stand still Juliet, no one's fairer than I When you fell for me you swore it'd be for life Well I'm not dead yet, Juliet In my eyes the big picture is vague, I'm narrow sighted and colorblind You differentiate distinctions like night and day when you see in only black and white But there's a hazy gray area in every situation that to me never quite stands out So, if I tell you that we're over and I'm acting off-color, give me the benefit of a doubt There's an ocean in my head Your devotion's in the air, I'm holding my breath If I start to drown in my emotions, don't abandon shipI’ve got the rhythm; she’s got the moves All tight fits in all the right grooves She’ll cut the rug if I cut her loose I got the rhythm; she’s got the moves Every sugar rush ends in a crash Every week’s got a flavor but it never lasts Mmm, bad taste, I’m guilty of that, I know Well I’ve never been a Class A act I’m an over-achiever with my courtesy laughs But I can fake a mean heart attack when I’m losing control Yeah, I know what I like I know where I stand, 3 steps behind a girl I once had I took 2 steps right, I got 1 step left She’ll weaken my knees until I can’t stand I’ve got the rhythm; she’s got the moves All tight fits in all the right grooves She’ll cut the rug if I cut her loose I got the rhythm; she’s got the moves But she moves on oh so fast Slithered on by like a snake in tall grass I couldn’t keep up my front with no backbone Well this time it wasn’t an act I threw a pity party, gave myself a pat on the back Cause pure integrity is something I lack when I’m losing controlIn this world, it's all about who you know And I know someone that's out of this world So all my doubts and worries that could bring me down Are in His hands, so mine are still You've gotta have love - love, love, love And you'll find life - la, la, life And once you've lived - live, live, lived It'll go to show, it's not about who you are but all about who you know And I know Him  And He is love In this world, true love rarely shows What we lack is something real We live through dreams, infatuated feelings, and fantasies Yeah, boys will be boys and girls will be girls We're all lost and lonely; we're all walking blind In a world manipulating our heart and soul and mind We live in deprivation of what is true in life Too numb on medication to feel that we're deprived Deep down there's something missing; our empty hearts won't heal Until You come in and fill that spot that only You can fill Our callused eyes will open; our natured minds will close And we'll see truth in life and all because of lovePretty girl, when you're tossed, you turn And all I needed was a way to learn Mm-hm, one day at a time You wanted years you could later recall You shake and tremble with the aftershock Oh-ho, one day at a time What's left of a prize possession We'll cash out in another dimension Only banking on the world still spinning high In the palm of my hand And I'll fly, get about in my getaway van And we're fine, hear me out, I'm a miracle man And I won't say anything, I'll keep a secret till I die And we'll fly, I'll re-live it one day at a time A stranger guided me into the night A revelation turned black to white Mm-hm, one day at a time You were falling for the words he wrote But I was busy looking out below Oh-ho, one day at a time An opportunity, a valuable lesson For what I'm worth at a dime a dozen The wedding bells more appealing on the second chime Play an opening song and I'll keep it up, keep it up, keep it up We'll fly, get about in my getaway van And we're fine, hear me out, I'm a miracle man And I won't say anything, I'll keep a secret till I die And we'll fly, I'll re-live it one day at a timeYou've told another lie this time You stood up but your legs aren't moving again It's your call but it better be the last try You hold ransom for tuition that I've already spent So give it up, give it up, it's time They're auditioning new roles, hoping we don't catch 'em pulling our legs Don't go the audience from last night Spread the word and the new crowd's showing up Throw the dirt and leave the path beat covered up so we don't know you're there Hold your breath until your heart stops beating Hold your breath until your heart stops beating so fast Once more, the story of your whole life For you it's all just a game, but the game never ends Your hiding in the closet while your one night stand's waiting with his eyes closed counting to ten Now gather around, gather around, hats off While they're tossing in their quarters might as well give all the people a show Don't cry, I'm not so good at goodbyes You're moving on at the same pace I'm giving up Throw the dirt and leave the path beat covered up so we don't know you're there Hold your breath until your heart stops beating Hold your breath until your heart stops beating so fast Giving orders from the back seat while the passengers are all unaware Hold your breath until your heart stops beating Hold your breath until your heart stops beating so fastI'll take the blame for you for taking one Chance away from me at getting over this And what you were to me, your work is done I'm laughing, after all we're getting too old for this And what a pretty night, what a pretty night You finally fit into my shoes, I'm never dressed for the occasional Invasion of surprises, I don't get surprised You think your secret's safe with you I'll catch it swinging through the grapevine It's time I let you go And here's looking at you, kid Your last word comes out Slower than you thought it would It's all you ever wanted But you couldn't see me coming with the lights out You're gonna find out I'll leave you raining on your own parade Gung ho, you let your guard down You're nothing but a write-out I'll leave you raining on your own parade I'm taking shame with you for taking 2 Too many years that could have lasted, now, we'll never get back But tonight the moon will set the mood I'm a train routed off course just to keep on track and What a petty crime, what a petty crime How could you be anything but greedy when it's all that you know Give another try, give another try But if you're one for the money than you're too good to show On time I let you down And here's looking at you, kid Now that I found And caught you red handed I'm the last man standingWell, situated from beginning but I'm ending appalled Live to tell overrated short stories of the lady you loved Once upon a time, fairytales took hold Manipulating when the readers threw the writers a bone Well, situated from beginning but I'm ending appalled I'm changing on my own I think I'm out of control, I think I'm out of control A pretty boy state of mind only got me alone I think I'm out of control, I think I'm out of control I fancy falling apart before I'm falling in love We only started, we only started too late Now we're parting our ways to be one of a kind I'll take you back if you're feeling alive I'll take you back if you're feeling alive Babe, I'm all you need to survive I'll take you back if you're feeling alive"Hey," said the lady with a bittersweet look in her eye"What a beautiful day," she pretended as her voice disappeared in a cry I'll write you out of the story like you knew that I would Living happily ever after never happens for good Well, you're only getting what you want cause you're getting a rise I'm just along for the rideCaroline, yeah, was my kind of girl Then she up and fell in love with herself Thinks she's gotta be some celebrity I just gotta know, is she leaving me I called her on her cell phone She got no reception Sounded like a dead zone Cutting out like ah ah ah Like a game show I bombard her with questions Like a caught off guard contestant She's stuttering like ah ah ah She must be dreaming Oh, she must be dreaming Sounds like she's going out out out out Out of her mind, sounds like she's going Rock star, swaggers like a hotshot Caroline, whoa Hollywood took the girl She'll be fine, whoa Living on top of the world Caroline, whoa Hollywood took the girl She'll be fine, whoa Living on top of the worldLet down when you're on top, you don't stop Gotta let the little lady talk One round says you both drop, you don't stop You don't stop the lovers hanging on Well, welcome home, midnight till dawn Light the battle fields, we'll tear the walls down The girl pulls her own, heads start to fall See the shock of a citywide blackout She takes the cake to the podium top I got nothing left now but to carry on, I'll carry on Well, welcome home, midnight till dawn Light the battle fields and let her carry you on Hey, so make your best wishes I like to watch them all circle around Let down when you're on top, you don't stop Gotta let the little lady talk One round says you both drop, the last call On the house where the lovers hanging on Back down, get on the wall, you don't stop You gotta let the little lady talk One round says you both drop, you don't stop You don't stop the lovers hanging on
