Far over the Misty Mountains rise Leave us standing upon the height What was before we see once more Is our kingdom a distant light Fiery mountain beneath the moon The words unspoken, we'll be there soon For home a song that echoes on And all who find us will know the tune Some folk we never forget Some kind we never forgive Haven't seen the back of us yet We'll fight as long as we live All eyes on the hidden door To the Lonely Mountain borne We'll ride in the gathering storm Until we get our long forgotten gold We lay under the Misty Mountains cold In slumbers deep, and dreams of gold We must awake, our lives to make And in the darkness a torch we hold From long ago when lanterns burned Until this day our hearts have yearned Her fate unknown, the Arkenstone What was stolen must be returnedA face in the crowd is watching me Don’t you forget That love cannot be taken for granted You’ll have to believe it That’s all right But I never seem to work out how it ends And I think it’s almost never making sense And it’s hard to control Cause love is emotional Inside the walls of monasteries Men make their rounds And knowledge is their friend Written down reminding us that Love is a concept the road to redemption That’s all right But I never seem to work out what they meant And I think it’s almost never making sense But it’s out of control Cause love is emotional I feel like a lone star Out there on the edge of the universe Kids sleeping with their headphones All crying in the car on the way home Mom’s crying in the front seat Now they’re playing our song on the radioShe’ll be the Queen of the bees with a worker divine She’ll be the buzz that you heard in the back of your mind Show me the birth of a legend that can’t be controlled Waking us up with a song that can never grow old He’s on a vespa He wears a hair net A tattoo arrow heart to wrap your arms around See him leaning around the corner He is a sensitive guy In love That could be dangerous He is a lighting rod to love That comes from the sky above He is a man to trust in love Just when you think every thing is lost Give me a world that the travelers have never laid eyes on I wonder if love can discover the natural high How many days should you waste as you wake up you mind Thinking now that the knowledge that every one dies He’s on a vespa He wears a hair net A tattoo arrow heart to wrap your arms around See him leaning around the corner He is a sensitive guy"I might be old but I'm someone new," she said"I'm so sore that I could cry always In the night lay your tired arms"And she will have her way Somehow, I will still believe her She's the life I've been frightened of Seems like deathly silence and especially the dark Feels like I am heavy, and my spirit has died She will have her way Somehow, I will still believe her She will have her way One day I will come back, yeah'N' doot 'n' doo doo'N' doot 'n' doo doo'N' doot 'n' doo doo'N' doot 'n' doo doo Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ahCruel shape Oh what have I done Punching a wall Nearly broke my thumb It’s harder than you think Not that it matters If I show myself to you Come on I know you will That must be how The music is meant to be played A rush of blood Then it’s gone as fast as it came Chameleon days And your anger is red Envy is green But if you have a choice You can always be blue Shall I show myself to you Come on I know you will That must be how The music is meant to be played The colours change In our lives We all have our own Chameleon daysSee it anyone got my eyes got my face Sing it everyone got my nose got my blood Conscience plays upon me now Safe until my luck runs out Cuckoos call, pendulum swings I thought you knew everything Lift my hands, make the cross Sinner, I have never learned Beginner, I cannot return Forever, I must walk this earth Like some forgotten soldier These things, I should keep to myself But I feel somehow strangely compelled Under moonlight, I stood wild and naked Felt no shame just my spirit awakened Sinner Seein' everything Got my eyes got my face Fireball drop from the sky All my dreams have come to pass Where's my faith, is it lost Can't see it 'til you cast it offAs it was in the beginning So it will be in the end You have to keep on guessing The world will never change I’m sending you a message From a million miles away Are you aware you are controlled By forces still unknown There will be no sunset When the rain is falling It’s hard to hear thunder When the river keeps roaring Then one day it’s over Like it never happened Disappear without a trace On Independence Day We are use to thinking Our plans were set in stone You're giving me an update You think every one has to know I guess I am an accomplice To the true original sin So let me take your suffering Let me take you inHere on Welbeck Street The body must move on Twirling my umbrella Stepping lightly past the throng Lonely as a child That lives among old men Lonely as the body Left behind when souls have fled Left behind when souls have fled Alone Alone Alone Alone Through the streets of London I once called you home Alone Alone Alone Alone City made of gray Blood shot with busses Carry them away To old familiar placesMake it level Don’t misunderstand Make it level On the other hand Every age is a different color Deeper for the memory of the sun If you want to take your place Find a present every day If you want to answer yes We won’t have to double guess And there is more than one of you But only one of them is true Make it level When you take a breath Make it level There is enough time left If you want to take your place Find a present every day If you want to answer yes She’ll follow you right into bed Well there is more than one of you But only one of them is trueI went up to Widow’s Peak To run my dog Had to get him up to speed And catch my breath The sky and the earth turned red And the daylight fled Hail son of ancient war like beast Finding trails in the mud You can smell the blood Buried under my feet I went up to Widow’s Peak I went up to Widow’s Peak Feeling dread Laid down my jangling nerves on a make shift bed Then I got so tired and I wanted just to sleep But I could not close my eyes for fear of what I might see Hail son of ancient war like beast Follow trails in the mud You can smell the blood Buried under my feet
