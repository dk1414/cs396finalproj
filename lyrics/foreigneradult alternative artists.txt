I've gotta take a little time A little time to think things over I better read between the lines In case I need it when I'm older Now, this mountain, I must climb Feels like a world upon my shoulders Through the clouds, I see love shine It keeps me warm as life grows colder In my life, there's been heartache and pain I don't know if I can face it again Can't stop now, I've traveled so far To change this lonely life I wanna know what love is I want you to show me I wanna feel what love is I know you can show me Oh I'm gonna take a little time A little time to look around me I've got nowhere left to hide It looks like love has finally found meStanding in the rain, with his head hung low Couldn't get a ticket, it was a sold out show Heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene Put his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream He heard one guitar, just blew him away He saw stars in his eyes, and the very next day Bought a beat up six string in a secondhand store Didn't know how to play it, but he knew for sure That one guitar felt good in his hands Didn't take long to understand Just one guitar, slung way down low Was a one way ticket, only one way to go So he started rocking He is never going to stop Got to keep on rocking Someday he's going to make it to the top And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes He's a juke box hero He took one guitar, Juke box hero, , he'll come alive tonight, In a town without a name, in a heavy downpour Thought he passed his own shadow, by the backstage door Like a trip through the past, to that day in the rain And that one guitar made his whole life changeSo long I've been lookin' too hard, I've been waiting too long Sometimes I don't know what I will find I only know it's a matter of time When you love someone When you love someone It feels so right, so warm and true I need to know if you feel it too Maybe I'm wrong Won't you tell me if I'm comin' on too strong This heart of mine has been hurt before This time I want to be sure I've been waiting for a girl like you To come into my life I've been waiting for a girl like you A love that will survive I've been waiting for someone new To make me feel alive Yeah, waiting for a girl like you To come into my lifeYou're as cold as ice You're willing to sacrifice our love You never take advice Some day, you'll pay the price I know I've seen it before, it happens all the time You're closing the door, you leave the world behind You're digging for gold, you're throwing away A fortune in feelings but, some day, you'll pay You're as cold as ice You're willing to sacrifice our love You want paradise But some day, you'll pay the price I know I've seen it before, it happens all the time You're closing the door, you leave the world behind You're digging for gold, you're throwing away A fortune in feelings but, some day, you'll payI would climb any mountain Sail across a stormy sea If that's what it takes me, baby To show you how much you mean to me And I guess it's just the woman in you That brings out the man in me I know I can't help myself You're all in the world to me I have waited a lifetime Spent my time so foolishly But now that I've found you Together we'll make history And I know that it must be the woman in you That brings out the man in me I know I can't help myself You're all that my eyes can seeYou're not shy, you get around You want to fly, don't want your feet on the ground You stay up, you won't come down You want to live, you want to move to the sound Got fire in your veins Burning hot, but you don't feel the pain Your desire is insane You can't stop until you do it again But sometimes I wonder as I look in your eyes Maybe you're thinking of some other guy But I know, yes I know, how to treat you right That's why you call me in the middle of the night You say it's urgent So urgent, so oh-oh urgent Just wait and see How urgent my love can be It's urgent You play tricks on my mind You're everywhere but you're so hard to find You're not warm or sentimental You're so extreme, you can be so temperamentalI've gotta take a little time A little time to think things over I better read between the lines In case I need it when I'm older Now, this mountain, I must climb Feels like a world upon my shoulders Through the clouds, I see love shine It keeps me warm as life grows colder In my life, there's
