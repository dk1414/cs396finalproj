The skag is set-up threatened to slap his head off Come on come on some fun He pulls a blade on the blade Turns tail and needs to run to see more rises than sets There ain't nothing that he regrets Was a has-been now's an am-is the kid laughs"I don't need no pig stomping on my buzz"All alone but when he wants to be He hangs out with the sparse company If she thaws he withdraws The bastard stands and he says"I don't need no pig stomping on my buzz."Black light poster child Is your face too tired to smile Bazooka head police cop dreams in black and white Living black days under white light What became of the chicks you knew Or the man that you hanged The tales got taller your hair did too When no one listen you got nothing to do Poster child your scars I've seen But what are they supposed to mean If you've seen it all if you're so wise Tell me what goes on between those eyes Living in the cellar no windows to see Under a black light no images free A unicorn or harley from hell Only paper pals to smell your smells Little black light poster child Is your face too tired to smile Bazooka head police cop dreams in black and white Living black days under white light Poster child your scars I've seen But what are they supposed to mean If you've seen it all if you're so wise Tell me what goes on between those eyesWho's that coming down the road A sailor from the sea He looks a lot like me I'd know him anywhere, had to stare Feathers at his fingertips A halo 'round his spine He must have lost his mind He should be put away, right away In the corner of the night He handed me his water pipe His eyes were searching Deep inside my head, here's what he said Sorry, I can't stop and talk now I'm in kind of a hurry anyhow But I'll send you a tape from California New York City has exploded And it's crashed upon my head I dove beneath the bed Fighting, biting nails, turning pale The landlord's at my window And the burglar's at my door I can't take it anymore I guess I'll have to fly, it's worth a tryI prepare with the same old thoughts The cackling of whores as they laugh and speak Arched backs bounce on peak faces covered with hair Show concentration and a stare Yeah I thirst and I slake It's my gift to you and you decide and you subside It's history now And as flesh is on both ears those old hands force it near I come to attention and make my decision to leaveJust as the old captain returns to the docks So must Virgil Make his way to the chopping block His fingers are bones And he's puffed with gout He's stewing souse with what they left out He takes the parts nobody wants And simmers them down with love But the deed is not appreciated When the odor wafts to the floors above He's a good guy He doesn't understand why hooves, snouts, and tails Fire up no demand But he's back to the slaughter Yeah Life in the bigs Cursed be the higher-ups Who would part him from his pigs All hail Virgil and his return He's a craftsman You see a mold that they burned Hunh Short straw always wins Like the cockroach crows There are things I don't want to know Lights are on ain't nobody home Giggle now and laugh last Eyes are open Think fast Skid marks mark the spot There's no point in asking why You paid me off too long ago Cross my palm hope to die Lights are on ain't nobody home Giggle now, laugh last Eyes are open Think fast Seventy miles on a ninety degree turn The hard way's the best to learn Short straw always wins Like the cockroach crows Skid marks mark the spot There's no point in asking why You paid me off too long ago Cross my palm hope to dieIt's a harsh toke buddy But you're messing with your life When the sun's shining hot The devil's beating your wife You can take to the window to see where she's at You can do all this and kick the cat I was feeling too good it wasn't right at all And it smelled like gasoline And it smelled like exhaust I need to get my head on straight So I can screw it up all the better next time The heap the home the bed Whatever you'd say it's been It hold the smell and you won't soon slide back In you can take to the roof to see where she's at You can do all this and kick the catRose Island Road YeahI feel the power of the sun on my back So good That heat's good That light has a mind to take it away Take it away...Let something go If it comes back it's a good thing A good life A good feeling But it has a mind to take it away Take it away...Take it away and it's gone I feel the power of the sun on my back So good...that heat's good That light has a mind to take it away Take it away...Take it away and it's goneThe skag is set-up threatened to slap his head off Come on come on some fun He pulls a blade on the blade Turns tail and needs to run to see more rises than sets There ain't nothing that he
