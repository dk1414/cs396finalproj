Shadow forces, back to the front Walks like the Prince, the Saiyan's stomp Rage is on, anger is a gift Breakdown weapon to kill you with one riff Step by step we move forward Tenshimato technique, unbreakable guard Hard is the mission but I trust my faction Mystical ambition needs lyrical possession BO OM Watch your back the dope boys are back BO OM Dark mentor the Knight of the night BO OM Five soldiers still dressed in black BO OM One Emperor, undefeated might Lurks in my shadow, hate waits its time Like Gaara and his mother, untouchable rhyme Crime after crime he consumes my soul Day after day I lose control I try to react, fight back kick back He tries to confront, attacks by night The worst is coming, reality's ghost This is the cost when you become the host Humanity's lost, birth of the beast At last the dark demon will be unleashed Fist in the air, the story is on Weapon of destruction, I don't come aloneHell, yeah, coming at you once again, guess who's back The one original band in this sanitized scene comes to kill this track Like Bejita, I come back stronger And more vicious, sharp like Shura Motherfucking industry cocksucker You've sold out your wide-opened ass Make me laugh, make me cry, let you die When I see what your band wants and tries I'm of another caliber, all together Contracts torn to pieces like Mecha-Freezer Get the fuck off, motherfucker Back the fuck off, fucking hustler What the fuck  What the fuck I don't wanna, I don't need ya Watch the fire of the Saiya Get the fuck off, motherfucker Back the fuck off, fucking hustler What the fuck  What the fuck I don't wanna, I don't need ya Watch the fire of the Saiya This first album is a victory, created, composed and paid by ourselves Dedicated to all our friends, supporters and sadly, our dead onesTimes are hard today for me and I I miss them since the beginning guy And all this hate tires me, real This life shakes me up, puts me in the ordeal Headbutt, kickback, mother fucking chop But I won't become a slave of my troubles, I get up Pop Pop Saiya's way'll push me up I've lost my marks but maybe it's my trump Challenge your fears Never look back Keep walking Fight for your dreams Respect your childhood dreams'Cuz you'd never been closer to yourself than at this age Teen, you learn and seek But sometimes you get lost and fall At this moment rise up and take control Chose the good way, hard way, find a goal Fight till you die, protect your ideas And walk all the way with the Saiya spirit Challenge your fears Never look back Keep walking Fight for your dreamsShadow forces, back to the front Walks like the Prince, the Saiyan's stomp Rage is on, anger is a gift Breakdown weapon to kill you with one riff Step by step we move forward Tenshimato
