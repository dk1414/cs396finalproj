I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors I screamed his name 'til the neighbors called the cops I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver Don't know what I did next, all I know I couldn't stop Word got around to the barflies and the baptists My mama's phone started ringin' off the hook I can hear her now, sayin' she ain't gonna have it Don't matter how you feel, it only matters how you look Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together Even when you fall apart But this ain't my mama's broken heart I wish I could be just a little less dramatic Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames Leave it to me to be holding the matches When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make My mama came from a softer generation Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little faceHey there, Mr  Tin Man You don't know how lucky you are You shouldn't spend your whole life wishin'For something bound to fall apart Every time you're feeling empty Better thank your lucky stars If you ever felt one breaking You'd never want a heart Hey there, Mr  Tin Man You don't know how lucky you are I've been on the road that you're on It didn't get me very far You ain't missing nothing'Cause love is so damn hard Take it from me, darling You don't want a heart Hey there, Mr  Tin Man I'm glad we talked this out You can take mine if you want it It's in pieces now By the way there, Mr  Tin Man If you don't mind the scars You give me your armor And you can have my heartSting of the needle dropping on a vinyl Neon singer with a jukebox title full of heartbreak33, 45, 78 When it hurts this good you gotta play it twice Another vice All dressed up in a pretty black label Sweet salvation on a dining room table Waiting on me Where the numb meets the lonely It's gone before it ever melts the ice Another vice, another call Another bed I shouldn't crawl out of At 7 A M with shoes in my hand Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again And I know I'll be back tomorrow night, oh I wear a town like a leather jacket When the new wears off, I don't even pack it If you need me I'll be where my reputation don't precede me Maybe I'm addicted to goodbyesYou only love me for my big sunglasses And my Tony Lamas And my Dodge Dart Classic You said "I'll be Johnny and you'll be June I'll ride with you to the moon"But guess what You can't ride in my little red wagon The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'You can't step to this backyard swagger You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like Ohhhh Ahhhh Ohhhh Ahh Oh, heaven help me I been sowwin' wildflower seeds And chasin' tumbleweeds But that's just who I be And you're just tryin' to slow this rolling stone But I'm on to you babe So guess what Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen Pulled up to the church but I got so nervous Had to back it on up, couldn't make it to the service Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress Rolled down a window Where you headed to next Said I'm heading to the bar with my money out of the mattress Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing Wake up in the morning, don't know what happened Whoa..  somethin' bad Whoa..  somethin' bad Now me and that girl that I met on the street We're rollin' down the road, down to New Orleans Got a full tank of gas and the money out of the mattress Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happenOoh Ooh Yeah,  I'm a turner I turn pages all the time Don't like where I'm at34  was bad, so I just turn to 35 Yeah,  I'm a keeper I keep digging down for the deep Like  the records I'm playing They might keep you waiting But you know I'm only playing for keeps And if the house just keeps on winning I  got a wildcard up my sleeve And if love keeps giving me lemons I'll just mix 'em in my drink And if the whole wide world stops singing And all the stars go dark I'll keep a light on in my soul Keep a bluebird in my heart Ooh OohWeather man said, it’s gonna snow By now I should, be used to the cold Mid-February shouldn’t be so scary It was only December I still remember the presents, the tree, you and me But you went away How dare you I miss you They say I’ll be O KBut I’m not going to ever get over you Living alone, here in this place I think of you, and I’m not afraid Your favorite records make me feel better Cause you sing along With every song I know you didn’t mean to give them to meI know they say, "You can’t go home again"I just had to come back one last time Ma'am, I know you don't know me from Adam But these hand prints on the front steps are mine Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar And I bet you didn't know under that live oak My favorite dog is buried in the yard I thought if I could touch this place or feel it This brokenness inside me might start healing Out here it’s like I'm someone else I thought that maybe I could find myself If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave Won't take nothing but a memory From the house that built me Mama cut out pictures of houses for years From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazine Plans were drawn and concrete poured Nail by nail and board by board Daddy gave life to Mama's dreamThere's trouble where I'm going But I'm gonna go there anyway I hate Sunday mornings'Cause they always seem to start this way I'm looking for a lighter I already bought the cigarettes Guess I picked me up a habit On my way out of Lafayette Eastbound and down I turn it up 'cause that's sure how I feel My mind is racing through the pines My hands are shaky on the steering wheel I'm going North on 59 but I know good and well I'm headed South'Cause me and Birmingham Don't have a history of working out What I lost in Louisiana I found back in Alabama But nobody ever taught me how to stay It ain't love that I'm chasing But I'm running just in case I ain't unpacked my suitcase Since the day that I turned twenty one It's been a long ten years since then It's getting kinda cumbersome The first one and the last one And the one that's got my name in ink The smoker and the fighter And the one in every song I singShould I give up sunsets for marigold mornings Should I look for rainbows or wait for the rain Is happiness on the highway  Or is it parked in the driveway Should I lean on you, babe  Or should you lean on me Am I looking for comfort  Am I looking for an escape Am I looking for you  Am I looking the other way I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon Caravan and an empty kitchen Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds One heart goin' both directions One love and a couple of questions Am I settlin' up or settlin' down Am I settlin' up or settlin' down I could plant a pretty garden or just send myself flowers Be a jet-set Friday or a Sunday hometown girl I could stay a little lonely or let you get to know me Yeah, I could love a picket fence if it wrapped around the world I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon Caravan and an empty kitchen Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds I'm one heart goin' both directions One love and a couple of questions Am I settlin' up or settlin' down
