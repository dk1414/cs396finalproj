One, two, three, four, tell me that you love me more Sleepless long nights, that is what my youth was for Old teenage hopes are alive at your door Left you with nothing, but they want some more Oh, oh-oh, you're changin' your heart Oh, oh-oh, you know who you are Sweetheart, bitter heart, now I can't tell you apart Cozy and cold, put the horse before the cart Those teenage hopes who have tears in their eyes Too scared to own up to one little lie Oh, oh-oh, you're changin' your heart Oh, oh-oh, you know who you are One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten Money can't buy you back the love that you had then One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten Money can't buy you back the love that you had thenGet what I want And still it's a mysterious thing that I want So when I get it I make sense of a mysterious thing'Cause I've taken flight on such a serious wing I, and you are the same and Either fiction or dreaming We know enough to admit We know enough to admit We know enough to admit It's my pleasure And your pleasure It's my pleasure And your pleasure Oh, an echo calls up the line An indication of time Our togetherness That is how we evolved We became our needs Ages up inside Escaping similar pain Dreaming safe and secure Generations in line Old and then the youth Come to meet or fade A chromosomal raid Built by what we got built for As much as what we avoid So the mystery liftsMy moon, my man, so changeable and Such a loveable lamb to me My care, my coat leave on a high note There's nowhere to go but on Heart on my sleeve, not where it should be The song's out of key again My moon's white face, what day and what phase It's the calendar page again Take it slow, take it easy on me And shed some light, shed some light on me please Take it slow, take it easy on me And shed some light, shed some light on me please My moon and me, not as good as we've been It's the dirtiest clean I know My care, my coat leave on a high note There's nowhere to go There's nowhere to go Take it slow, take it easy on me And shed some light, shed some light on me please Take it slow, take it easy on me And shed some light, shed some light on me pleaseI'm sorry Two words I always think After you're gone When I realize, I was acting all wrong So selfish Two words that could describe Oh, actions of mine When patience is in short supply We don't need to say goodbye We don't need to fight and cry Oh, we, we could Hold each other tight, tonight We're so helpless We're slaves to our impulses We're afraid of our emotions And no one knows where the shore is We're divided by the oceans And the only thing I know is That the answer isn't for us No, the answer isn't for usTry to find a way to talk about it I’m also in the mind to just let it go How to reach out my mind if I can’t think straight With the goodness so gone I feel to isolate You called me baby, I called you one too Until you spoke to me with another voice You sent in spiders to fight for you I was so disappointed I didn’t know what to do I wish I didn’t miss you I wish I didn’t miss you I wish I didn’t miss you I wish I didn’t miss you Wasting so many hours away So many ways to waste a day In this same city I hope you’re not'Cause the town has shrunk to the size of my thoughts It was so mystifying to see you so changed I felt some certainty you must have died Because how could I live if you’re still alive I wish I didn’t miss you I wish I didn’t miss you I wish I didn’t miss you I wish I didn’t miss youHelping the kids out of their coats But wait the babies haven't been bor-or-or-or-or-orn, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Unpacking the bags and setting up And planting lilacs and buttercu-u-u-u-u-u-ups, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh But in the meantime I've got it hard Second-floor living without a yard It may be years until the day My dreams will match up with my pay O-o-o-o-o-o-old dirt road Knee-e-e-e-e-e-e deep snow Watching the fire as we grow O-o-o-o-o-o-old I've got a man to stick it out And make a home from a rented hou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ouse, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh And we'll collect the moments one by one I guess that's how the future's do-o-o-o-o-o-one, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh How many acres, how much light Tucked in the woods and out of sight Talk to the neighbours and tip my cap On a little road barely on the mapI feel it all I feel it all I feel it all I feel it all The wings are wide the wings are wide Wild card inside wild card inside Oh I'll be the one who'll break my heart I'll be the one to hold the gun I know more than I knew before I know more than I knew before I didn't rest I didn't stop Did we fight or did we talk Oh I'll be the one who'll break my heart I'll be the one to hold the gun I love you more I love you more I don't know what I knew before But now I know I wanna win the warLet it die and get out of my mind We don't see eye to eye Or hear ear to ear Don't you wish that we could forget that kiss And see this for what it is That we're not in love The saddest part of a broken heart Isn't the ending so much as the start It was hard to tell just how I felt To not recognize myself I started to fade And after all it won't take long to fall Now I know what I don't want I learned that with you The saddest part of a broken heart Isn't the ending so much as the start The tragedy starts from the very first spark Losing your mind for the sake of your heart The saddest part of a broken heart Isn't the ending so much as the startTravelling north, travelling north to find you Train wheels beating, the wind in my eyes Don't even know what I'll find when I get to you Call out your name, love, don't be surprised It's so many miles and so long since I've left you Don't even know what I'll find when I get to you But suddenly now, I know where I belong It's many hundred miles, and it won't be long Nothing at all, in my head, to say to you Only the beat of the train I'm on Nothing I've learned all my life on the way to you One day our love was over and gone It's so many miles and so long since I've met you Don't even know what I'll say when I get to you But suddenly now, I know where I belong It's many hundred miles, and it won't be long What will I do if there's someone there with you Maybe someone you've always known How do I know I can come and give to you Love with no warning and find you alone Clouds part Just to give us a little sun There's a limit to your love Like a waterfall in slow motion Like a map with no ocean There's a limit to your love Your love, your love, your love There's a limit to you care So carelessly there Is it truth or dare There's a limit to your care I love, I love, I love This dream of going upstream I love, I love, I love The trouble that you give me I know, I know, I know That only I can save me I'll go, I'll go, I'll go Right down the road
