as he appeared, he spoke about the future"We're not going to make it," he explained how the end will come"You and me were never meant to be part of the future"All we have is now All we've ever had is now All we have is now All we'll ever have is now I noticed that he had a watch and hat that looked familiar He was me, from a dimension torn free of the future"We're not going to make it," he explained how the end will come"You and me were never meant to be part of the future"All we have is now All we've ever had is now All we have is now All we'll ever have is nowAnd though they were sad They rescued everyone They lifted up the sun A spoonful weighs a ton Giving more than they had The process had begun A million came from one The limits now were none Being drunk on their plan, they lifted up the sun Forcing it off with their hands The trapdoor came undone Above our heads it swung The privilege had been won Being drunk on their plan, they lifted up the sun Yelling as hard as they can The doubters all were stunned Heard louder than a gun The sound they made was love
