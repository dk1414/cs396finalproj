Walking on a dream How can I explain Talking to myself Will I see again We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it On and on and on we are calling out, out again Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me Is it real now Two people become one I can feel it Two people become one Thought I'd never see The love you found in me Now it's changing all the time Living in a rhythm where the minute's working over time We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it On and on and on we are calling out, out again Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of meDays go by my window World slows down as it goes Goodbye to last night Lost my eyesight Can't you help me see Loving every minute 'cause you make me feel so alive, alive Loving every minute 'cause you make me feel so alive, alive Alive, alive Waking in the snow Tracing steps with you Swimming through the smoke Wrapped in velvet gold Can't you help me see Loving every minute 'cause you make me feel so alive, alive Loving every minute 'cause you make me feel so alive, alive Alive, aliveNow we are running in a pack to the place you don't know And I want you to know that I'll always be around Down where the summer and the late nights last forever There's a house on the hill and we can't travel now Alice D, you're on your way up Way up Way up I feel both sides, babe, high and low If I had my way, never let you go I feel both sides, babe, high and low If I had my way, never let you go Let's get together and forget all the troubles and just float I don't want you to go I need to be closer to now Alice D, you're on your way up Way up Way upWe can remember swimmin' in December Headin' for the city lights in 1975 We're sharin' each other, nearer than farther The scent of a lemon drips from your eyes We are the people that rule the world A force running in every boy and girl All rejoicing in the world Take me now, we can try We lived an adventure, love in the summer Followed the sun 'til night, reminiscing other times of life For each every other the feeling was stronger The shock hit eleven, we got lost in your eyes I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave me But I know I try Are you gonna leave me now Can't you be believin' now I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave me But I know I try Are you gonna leave me now Can't you be believin' now Surfing the snow Are you ready for A revolution to show the way Seven more weeks until the day Because heartbreak's coming to bend us the wrong way Praise us, memory will change it into old things Doesn't matter what's tripping you out, there's ways to go This is where we get carried away enough to start again While hearts beat It's nothing like before Dreaming is the home of the brave Future is the healing of pain Because heartbreak's coming to bend us the wrong way Praise us, memory will change it into old things Doesn't matter what's tripping you out, there's ways to go This is where we get carried away enough to start again Doesn't matter what's tripping you out, there's ways to go This is where we get carried away enough to start againOh, didn't matter where we lie Back in spring of '79 There were no rules to feel sublime Let's trek down the path We slept to the radio Gentle as my heart beats now Turn up the fuse all over again, my friend Rewind, we were D NA Don't wanna fade away Rewind, there's no yesterday It's our discovery Dreamtime, it's a special place Let's keep each other awake Our hearts, now they beat the same There is a thread that runs along The seam of all the paths we've crossed A colour wheel that spins around Weave all into one The price of getting setting suns We're running to the beat of the drum We are the creatures, rays and larks RelaxWhen I was young The feeling was there It is still there Unweaving in me As I recollect Take me back to the stems of it To the airs of the bear stone I’ll listen to them So I made up my mind I’ll be around for a while You can bet on your life I’ll be around for a while Call out my name, when you call I’ll be there I’m always runnin chasing fleas on a dep Come back in that light, come on darling shine Call out my name, when you call I’ll be there So I made up my mind I’ll be around for a while You can bet on your life I’ll be around for a whileCome on now can we talk about it like we used to talk about Hotel in the hills with a carousel Farmhouse in the front a tractor in the lounge Oh oh oh honey I need you round I know I know Listen now can we talk in love and walk the town Be easy now, go hiking through the hills in a summer gown Raise the kids, peace within and make our sound Hear me now, I'm down on knees and praying Though my faith is weak Without you so please baby please give us a chance Make amends and I will stand until the end A million times a trillion more Oh oh oh honey I need you round I know I know Smile baby don't cry I will only fly with you by my side Baby I'm cornered now Baby don't push me out Lately I walk in doubt Maybe it's crashing down Baby can you save it nowStraight down the line I watch you disappear Before my eyes saw through solid air They said you're fine That I shouldn't even care But I got wise Sought to find you there Sliding doors and the thirteenth floor It shifts and I don't wind up Dimensions rising out of my head And you never looked this good Never looked this good No one ever said that you'd be right here Now I gotta be scared of my friend No one ever said that you'd be right here Now I gotta be scared of my friend Way down the crime The second that you left Score some spice And tap another share Pay back the ride And I couldn't shake the fear While they climb high Look what's really thereWe got the best years ahead We know we do We reach for love It meets us on the headway Blind to the upcoming eye Caught in the fuss above Right in the prime of your life Struck by the force of us And all because we trust two vines Slowly growing right into your ears Show me all the life Lead us in your wind tonight Two vines Two vines We're going out Tonight, won't you come along We'll wake the dawn Not replaying memories Fly to the sky up above Caught into all of us Right in the prime of our lives Struck by the course of love
