I know I got a bad reputation And it isn't just talk, talk, talk If I could only give you everything You know I haven't got I couldn't have one conversation If it wasn't for the lies, lies, lies And still I want to tell you everything'Til I close my eyes Suddenly I'm on the street Seven years disappear below my feet Been breaking down Do you want me now Do you want me now Suddenly I'm down in Herald Square Looking in the crowd, your face is everywhere Been turning 'round Do you want me now Do you want me now Don't try to be an inspiration Just wasting your time, time, time You know about the best I'll ever be See it in your eyesWalking from the bus stop Couldn't wait to get off I know I am the lucky one Walking through the twilight Cold Nevada twilight I know I am the lucky one On the wheels, on the tabletop On the handles with my shirt off On the floor, on my heels again I know I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one Standing on the corner If I could find a dollar I know I'd be the lucky one Standing in the last light Artificial daylight I know I am the lucky one On the wheels, on the tabletop On the handles with my shirt off On the floor, on my heels again I know I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the oneCan you hear me Now the wind is dead You fell from the cloud In the frozen mud Can you see me And my idiot son Down in golden light Thrown out of the dark You came down down down down on a midnight storm You came down down down down on a midnight flash We've all been looking at you I must know, is it true Can you fly Can you fly Can you fly Can you hear the wind Now the light is dead You flew from your bed Woke up on the floor Can you fly tonight From my pointless fence Back up to the cloud Up into the windGet your red dress on, we'll go out tonight Where the blue light's right, we will shine, we will shine Get your red dress on, we'll go out tonight We will shine, we will shine We will shine like the stars Winding down with the hours I will shave in my sleep I will dream in my shower I brought you here But you don't complain And I find you crying on your birthday Get your red dress on, we'll go out tonight We will shine, we will shine, we will shine When I met you when Down on what's that street How you knew my name Why I wake up there sometimes still Now I'm five days tired And I'm twenty years poor And I'm sorry about your flowers I guess I slammed them in the door Well I brought you here But you don't complain And I find you crying on your birthdayWell I sold the dirt to feed the band Falling right through my hands Yes I sold the map up to the sky Falling down always Trying to wake up in your head Trying to cry with the red light on Trying to tell you I don't know Well I sold the dirt and bought the road Let me tell you right where we're going Yes I sold the house where I Iearned to walk Falling down always Fifty bucks to use the van Trying to find your city Trying to get back my guitars Trying to tell you I don't know Well I sold the dirt for a song Bleeding on every note Yes I sold the map up to the sky Falling down always Trying to sing what I can't say Trying to throw my head away Trying to cry with the red light on Trying to tell you I don't knowShe has gone to New York City That old suitcase holds no funny stories I packed it once on her first birthday Now that wasted shame has grown up with her The streets are slick with dew and motor oil A girl walks in and out of the morning sun A barred window reflects the cloudless sky No blue reaches those eyes She has gone to New York City Through that arch on a summer night I went there once on her first birthday Lay my burning head on the cool stone Its raining blossoms down in the concrete park A girl walks in and out of the evening shade A broken angel weeps through her spray paint smile No tears can reach me while I know I'm not responsible I know I'm not responsible I know I'm not responsible I know I'm not responsibleHigh off the roof we rise Flying to a hand up in the sky All the bells in the city ring I'm doing my California thing It was a la, a la, a la It was a lie, a lie, a lie I'm doing my California thing It's happening My house down on the rocks The waves stood up and began to walk All the bells in the valley sing I'm doing my California thingKnock it down Take it away We've got work tearin' down this place Take it away, Take it away, Take it away Here's the room where they laid awake through a complicated night He was starin' at the wall and she cried and cried and cried Under a roof that held the real rain out and covered up the sound He built her every wall and we have to tear it down Knock it down Take it away We've got work tearin' down this place Built for a ghost Haunted by love Left to decay Knock it down Take it away We've got work tearin' down this place Take it away, Take it away, Take it awayDown inside I feel the morning, still too dark to see Down in love I know they're wakin'No more dreams for me Down to the street with an early shakin' Down to the park but the park ain't open Down so far you must be jokin' No more dreams for me The day breaks down and cries a river, sucks me to my heart Down in love I know they're laughing, tearing us apart Down to the docks where the wind is blowing Down in the rain the cold and soaking Down so far you can't be broken No more dreams for me No more dreams for me Down to the street with an early shakin' Down to the park but the park ain't open Down so far you must be jokin' No more dreams for meMister can you tell me where I've come from Looked like hell to me, took so long And it's a frustration Like I really need one And the man at the station wouldn't help me at all Help me at all They think the Yank is just a jerk Well this clown hocked his golden gloves He ran out all ripped apart Holding that solid gold heart He paid the witch for a virgin's skinny arms The warmth of her tiny voice A little choice she won't recall A thin veil she would not lift I am sincere Mister can you tell me wat to call this place I've been cheated like I've never been And it's a frustration Like I really need one And the man at the hotel's been breaking my balls Breaking my balls They think the Yank is just a jerk Well this clown hocked his golden gloves He ran out all ripped apart Holding that solid gold heart
