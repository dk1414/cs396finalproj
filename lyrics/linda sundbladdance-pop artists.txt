baby who loves me Ten years and my dog died And my father was crying-94 my brother came into my world And all I wished for was a girl And now I understand what destiny has done to me And it was all good I could never imagine a boy would love me I could never imagine a boy would love me But I found a baby, a baby who loves me I could never imagine a boy would love me But I found out lately, when I found my baby Sixteen and still a virgin And that was all that mattered What was the future when I didn't even know myself I just lived in a fantasy And now I understand what destiny has done to me It was all good And I could never imagine a boy would love me I could never imagine a boy would love me But I found a baby, a baby who loves me I could never imagine a boy would love me But I found out lately, when I found my babyKomplett men täckt med sorg Jag fattar hur du mår Som en betongfasad Skrämmande underbar Knappast ett undantag Du gjorde rätt jag dog Spring nu allt vad du har Med benen på ryggen Benen på ryggen Ingen idé att stanna kvar När tårarna rinner Tårarna rinner Trasig Du klipper mig i bitar Spränger mig itu Du är trasig Lösa skruvar i din konstruktion Vitala andetag, klappande hjärtslag Du invaderar mig Nu torkar tårkanalen Du lämnar mig kvar Fortsätt att döda migVers 1 I see you look me up and down I bet you think I'm out of reach but I'm here right now And then I look into your eyes And you look down but peak back up To find I'm still around I feel a thing I never felt before How could this happen  I was so secure And you don't have a clue Just what I'm 'bout to do Guess who won the lottery Lucky, lucky you I'm about to hit you up Lucky, lucky you I'm about to fill your cup I'll let you dive and swim in my ocean Tonight, tonight my heart is wide open Lucky, lucky you I'm about to hit you up Lucky, lucky you Lucky, lucky me Lucky you Vers 2 But wait a minute, Am l aloud to feel this way And if it's all inside my head Then I am sorry, but I'll think I gotta tell you straightWell I woke up this morning Feeling closer than ever to God Wish he'd sent me a warning but he forgot Now I feel so bad Can you keep it, this dirty secret Can you feel me, oh tell me you do Can you heal me, cos I'm a believer And I'll be waiting here till you do Oh father I've been having these thoughts and I'm sorry Say a prayer you know what I need Oh father I've been touching myself and I'm worried Is heaven still open for me It was not my intention Thought he was from heaven sent So here's my confession I know I made a fool of myself Can you do it, can you forgive me Can you make it, make it undone Can you heal me, cos I'm a believer And I'll be waiting here till you do Oh father I've been having these thoughts and I'm sorry Say a prayer you know what I need Oh father I've been touching myself and I'm worried Is heaven still open for meKomplett men täckt med sorg Jag fattar hur du mår Som en betongfasad Skrämmande underbar Knappast ett undantag Du gjorde rätt jag dog Spring nu allt vad du har Med benen på ryggen Benen på ryggen Ingen idé att stanna kvar När tårarna rinner Tårarna rinner Trasig Du klipper mig i bitar Spränger mig itu Du är trasig Lösa skruvar i din konstruktion Vitala andetag, klappande hjärtslag Du invaderar mig Nu torkar tårkanalen Du lämnar mig kvar Fortsätt att döda migPounding heart on a Saturday night Sneaking peeks down my velvet skirt Cutie talk not to witty or bright But your beauty was the kind that could hurt L could tell from the look in your eyes L was trigging your insanity L just knew l could see it That l would lose you That l will lose u That l will lose you right from the start That l will lose u That l will lose you right from the start Blushing cheeks and kisses so sweet And that song on the radio Getting wet from the steam and the heat L was dripping from my head to my feet Made a stop at the end of the road Closed my eyes took a final breath Right there and then l just knew it That l would loose you That l will lose u That l will lose you right from the start That l will lose u That l will lose you right from the start That I will lose u Flowers and the seeds are flying Mama come get me l'm dying Am l in heaven Ooh Am I in heaven Ooh Am I in heaven Ooh Am I in heaven Ooh That l will lose u That l will lose you right from the start That l will lose u That l will lose you right from the start That I will lose u That I will lose u That I will lose you right from the start That I will lose you right from the start That I will lose uYou used to say when we girls were kids
