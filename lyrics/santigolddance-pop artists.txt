Don’t look ahead there’s stormy weather Another road block in our way But if we go, we go together Our hands are tied here if we stay Oh, we said our dreams will carry us And if they don’t fly we will run Now we push right past to find out How to win what they all lost Oh-ah, Oh-ah We know now we want more Oh-ah, Oh-ah A life worth fighting for Oh-ah, Oh-ah We know that we want more Oh-ah, Oh-ah A life worth fighting for So let them say we can’t do better Lay out the rules that we can’t break They want to sit and watch it wither Their legacy’s too hard to take Oh, we said our dreams will carry us And if they don’t fly we will run Now we push right past to find out How to win what they all lost360, 5 left, I’m counting it to the day I’m thinking if I did everything I said, or if the year got the best of me One thing about time, it waits for nobody, you told me, isn’t that what they say Been batting ‘gainst it and getting nowhere, just racin’ got nothing to say to nobody Little lady you better get in line, now I’m talking this to myself Better get in on down with the program, don’t sell your lot for an old broke dream they been sellin’ ya Free fallin like Tom Petty, waitin’ on this rodeo to haul I break my own rules, steal my way home, and guard the still there like a beast We race the globe The shakers and the fools We trouble you know You’ll find us where we fall, we chasing shadows And I can’t have it, have it any other way And I can’t have it, have it any other way I’m not gon’ have it, have it any other way And I can’t have it, have it any other way Always knew I’d be international No fear of flying Limousines, big people, their parties But I’m on an island Watching through a window The flashing light on the bed Neon sign goes red“You Are Here” it says Well, at least someone knows where I amOooh woah oh oooh, oooh I can’t get enough of myself If I wasn’t me I can be sure I’d want to be I’m pretty major And I’ll say it out loud Living a living a fantasy Live
