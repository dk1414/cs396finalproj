Desert you Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh Hurt you We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it Inside, we both know what's been going on We know the game, and we're gonna play itIf there's anything you need All you have to do is say You know you satisfy everything in me We shouldn't waste a single day So don't stop me falling, it's destiny calling A power I just can't deny It's never changing, can't you hear me, I'm saying I want you for the rest of my life Together forever and never to part Together forever we're two And don't you know I would move heaven and earth To be together forever with you If they ever get you down There's always something I can do Because I wouldn't ever wanna see you frown I'll always do what's best for youGod walks home through the local park Meets the devil with a broken heart He says"I've been let down by the armies of darkness Oh my whole life's a mess"And God says"I got the cure I'm holding on to something pure I got the cure for you All you gotta do is dance Pick your feet up All you gotta do is dance Feel the beat, love All you've gotta do is dance Dance with me"Now the devil thanks God and he's on his way Skip in his stride, what a beautiful day And then along comes a slacker with some fun in his hand Beelzebub knows he's got to save this man And the devil saysWhen I was a boy I saw my daddy crying at the steering wheel And oh, it made me feel so scared Then there was joy From my religion, swimming in a choir of voices And oh, I knew that I'd been spared That I'd be saved some sunny day Saved from throwing my life away That I'd be saved some sunny day From throwing my life, throwing my life away Keep singing, woah, I keep singing Praising to the heavens with my voice ringing Keep singing, woah, I keep singing Clap to the beat till my hands are stinging And I'd be saved some sunny day From throwing my life, throwing my life away And now I understand I'm a wide-eyed father, and blessed are the children Oh, our greatest reward And with these hands I'll move a mountain, build a castle to keep you safe Of this you know you can be sureI'll bring my love to you I'll bring my love to you I've been stood up and messed around and taken for a fool But next time 'round, I'm gonna change the rules And I don't care about things that people say It's you I think about each and every day It's much too late for you to change your ways I can't keep holding on expecting you to stay When you're all alone and if you're feeling down Call me, I'll be around Whenever you need somebody I'll bring my love to you You don't have to say you love me I just wanna be with you Lost inside your love is where I wanna be I'm just asking you to spend some time with me Time and time you say you wanna be free And you can have some fun, that's okay with me You will never know just how good I feel The joy inside of me makes me feel so real When you're all alone and if you're feeling down Call me, and I'll be aroundSometimes I just don't feel like waking up Wanna stay inside my dreams Sometimes I feel like I am breaking up Do you know just how that feels Hope is for the hopeful It's a dream that never dies Faith is for the faithful I see it in your eyes And I got angels on my side I got angels flying high And everything will be alright'cause I got angels on my side I need the people that I really love To only give me truth Don't fake, I can't take it My heart is close to breaking It reminds me of my youth Hope is for the hopeful It's a dream that never fades Faith is for the faithful And I will not be swayedShe's taken my time Convinced me she's fine But when she leaves I'm not so sure It's always the same She's playing her game And when she goes I feel to blame Why won't she say she needs me I know she's not as strong as she seems Why don't I see her cry for help Why don't I feel her cry for help Why don't I hear her cry for help I wandered around The streets of this town Trying to find sense in it all The rain on my face It covers the trace Of all the tears I've had to wasteI don't know if I can make it But I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try I don't know if I can make it But just watch me try, watch me try When it feels like all my chances End in empty sighs I remember that the only thing That I can lose is pride You know I got to try Even though my heart is on the line Even if I'm broken on the inside There's nothing I won't do to make it right You know, you know I got to try All I know is nothing certain So I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try It's only myself that I'm hurting If I don't try, if I don't try When it feels like all my hopes and dreams Are shattered into dust I remember that the only thing I have to do is trustYou know I love you, but you don't know how much You know I need you, I need your touch You know I love you but you don't know how much No you don't, no you don't, no you don't But we can find a better way Have to find a better way We can find a better way To prove it, prove it, prove it It's a beautiful life if you give it a chance It will make you dance It's a beautiful life, alright, alright Do you feel it, with your feet on the ground Do you hear it, it makes no sound Do you feel it, the world is turning No you don't, no you don't, no you don't We can find a better way Have to find a better way We can find a better way To prove it, prove it, prove it It's a beautiful life if you give it a chance It will make you dance It's a beautiful life, alright, alrightDesert you Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh Hurt you We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I A
