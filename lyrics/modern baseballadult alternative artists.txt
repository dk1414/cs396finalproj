It's been three whole years of me thinking 'bout you every day Sometimes for hours, sometimes in passing Saw you from the bottom of the staircase Stood out for hours as you complained About how you haven't seen your friends yet That you're too drunk to stand and You not knowing if you can love him forever Bullshit, you fucking miss me!There, I said it  I guess I'll talk to you in a few months Sitting drunk on the sidewalk I guess I'll get up, I guess I'll go for a walk Press my shoes against the pavement I swear, this has gotta be the hundredth time I've thought of You tonight You weren't the only one who thought of us that way I spend most nights awake, wide awake I never thought that I, oh, I would see the day Where I'd just let you go, let you walk away Where I let you walk away Used to call you a crook, called you a bandit There ain't no other good damn reason why My heart, it would go missing For so many months, so I was wishing that you That you would stop pretending Remember all those countless nights When I told you I loved you And to never forget it  Oh, just forget it When I was just a boy We'll call it fifteen or so I found myself annoyed By a syndrome of sorts in my bones That girl who's next to me She found herself bored to tears She realized if she wanted conversation She's out of luck for three more years When I moved away from home One hundred miles or so I knew a change had grown Inside my awkwardly long limbs and bones That girl who's next to me She's friendly and thoughtful and quite awfully pretty But all she has to say Is a meathead-themed monologue on why Brad ran away She said, "All I can hope for is for me to get better'Cause all I can take is no more I'll win him back again, we'll be lovers, best friends He won't need no other woman Like he did way back when he was with me He needed more than me I'm friendly and thoughtful and quite awfully pretty But he needed more than me"I hate worrying about the future'Cause all my current problems are based around the past And I hate when you call me late at night Just to check in to make sure I got nothing to be sad about But it's all right, and I'm okay I won't need your help, anyway, ah, well I hate having to think about my future When all I wanna do is worry about everyone but me I'm so tired, or maybe just bored I can't really tell the difference whenever I'm talking to you And I know that you just adore Starting off with me, that way That there's no way that I'll assume That you're wasting all of my time To vent about your problems Like how your Instagram stopped working And how your friends bailed on you, but it was funny'Cause it was the day you were supposed to hang with me I'm guilty as charged for leading you on A lie that I know is easy to see But it's crucial to blot out any Signs that I might have feelings This way, you don't ask me, "How am I "This way you won't force me to proceed With actually having to tell you my worries With actually having you give a damn about me You giving a damn about.. I wanna start from the top Maybe like a do-over Replace the voices in my head With blind innocence I want a complete re-do Maybe change my name Report the losses, grab the claim"It's a shame, it's such a shame"We're pissing away our time'Cause we're pissing away these beers No monumental moment ever came from saying"Come on, dude, just take one more shot"Try to, try to forget That your bones will dismantle And the dreams you had They'll collide with time Your unrequited love for life will surely Halt that, I'm thinking way too much at night Maybe I could just move away Or go extinct like triceratops But I love loving watching movies Sitting back, and also breathing My family and friends would be crushed But is it enough  Oh, the future freaks me out, but I guess I could just Curl up in a ball and thinkThough I seem cool, calm, and collected Making my way to hipster with glasses Was a little more than just nerve wrackin'Kinda just counted on her to turn me into goo Praise whatever, it ended with a smile Cause for a bit, a tad, a little while I expected you two, to save the day with sly remarks Like "he's so cute" and "whatever you want"s Though the white jacket didn't fit The friends I came with did, perfectly Snugged right to my body Like sad movies and late-night drinks Could’ve guessed by the end of the hour There was more than just a little smile on my face Covered in custard and cookies and cream Pissed off I had to leave But all has to end You got a smile that could light this town And we might need it Cause it gets dark around here Real dark around here Most of my old friends I can only stand for the weekend But that doesn't apply here Doesn't apply hereDidn’t watch your ex’s set I just left and thought about you Like when your teeth graze those lips When you begin to smile Later, you took my hand You lead us to the doorway But you let go of me Once you saw all your friends And I’ve known you forever At least that’s what I tell Jake When I’m too drunk to walk home When your brother is away You suggested I write a song about the first time we met But I can’t seem to remember where or when Couldn’t watch your ex’s set Instead,​ I wrote this song about you Thought, "would you show your kids If you found the time was right ”You’d tell them where and when You never thought I’d leave the east coast We were young and full of sin And I too dumb to understandI saw you from the bottom of the stairs Before you knew I was coming And though nervous and scared I lingered on I heard most things break By the ends of these types of nights So I'll force upon Every word I brushed up on Since knowing we won't speak like this again You've got a certain who-knows-what about you And I've got a small amount of time To figure out what it is exactly and to whom does it apply But I know for a fact that these are broken nights Covered in bottles with the stench of loss of life And I know that it's quite Heartbreaking we won't speak like this againIs he here  Are you making out I can you hear you guys on the couch Shut up, make out, do something already, I'm waiting After reading that text from your friends I start losing all my confidence So I'll stay tired, I know soon I'll be bailing Then, you—you ask if I gotta leave And I wish that I could say no My head is on the verge of exploding No amount of aspirin or pizza could help this from hurting And now, I'm turning to you, scared shitless Hoping this song goes well Can we highlight the fact that My mouth smells like coffee and garlic The five cups I had this morning are getting to me I gotta go—I got the worst fucking spins Then, you—you ask if I gotta leave And I wish that I could say no But we’re so caught up in the moment And I just need a second to catch my goddamn breathShe said, "Let's start from the top Just rid of everything Like the notes in your pockets, the texts you're always locking And if it's all the same, forget all of those lines Where you mention my smile You got a lot of nerve complimenting me Through choruses and rhyme But I know how you get From time to time'We'll do this and that, oh, travel the map'And maybe just for a while I thought you were my re-do You thought you could change my name I could tell by the look on your face Whenever I would say—"But that when I stopped To listen or care About anything other than a plan of attack To get me back to where You are my re-do Or at least a pair of eyes that would notice when I Couldn't conjure words 'cause I thought about it too longThe fossils of my footsteps Will be unearthed at a far-off date unknown Impressed in concrete from walking home alone After walking you home And the mops of greasy hair Will romanticize my despair But they won't know That I didn't care I liked the silence I liked the empty streets Crawl down 'em on hands and knees in a heartbeat If I had to I owe them that, at the very least The map had faded out But I could've sworn I noted every stride I guess the rain hit before the ink could dry And where I thought I'd be Was not what I perceived Assessing the progress From beneath your sheets
