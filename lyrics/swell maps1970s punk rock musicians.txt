I don't wanna go because I know And all of those toys that crawl, they just reach for doors I don't wanna go because I know And I've seen you, you're crying above the ship You just stuck out hiding from the trees You just lost your fame inside the shop I don't wanna go because I know Oh  I can't see the pictures that you lost I don't wanna go because I know The only way out is to wait for it again You just stuck out hiding from the trees You just lost your fame inside the shop I don't wanna go because I know And I just bought a ship it's made of brass I don't wanna go because I know You're falling from the target like a toy You just stuck out hiding from the trees You just lost your fame inside the shop I don't wanna go because I know And I don't wanna ever see your face again, no more Oh  I don't wanna go because I know You pick it up and keep it like a toyNo more pushing, let's go and build a car We're ready for the fly-past, another slow film Waiting for a minor change, at last the scenery Always saving up to listen to some fiction Try to buy a castle But there's no windows left I don't mind a breakout But there's never enough time Whatever you are saving for At least know what you're waiting for Don't try pushing We'd rather buy a car Just waiting for the pictures in some line It's an easy catch in a courtyard When you're trying too hard Always waiting up in case the patterns break Try to catch that look That the others left I don't mind a breakout But there's never enough timeRead about Seymour yesterday In the news that found it’s way To where I sleep and seek to be Where I am, I hear, I see Read about Seymour in my mind Window stacks across the blinds The lightning tower on Pyre Hill I wonder where I’ll find my fill Don’t look out!Don’t look out!Don’t look out!Don’t look out!Read about Seymour, look my way Feel him near day after day All cutlass and alone, alas The spirit sank like mourning glass Read about Seymour yesterday In the news that found it’s way To where I sleep and seek to be Where I am, I hate to see Don’t look out!Don’t look out!Don’t look out!Don’t look out Say, that's a swell map Are you intent on making it Maybe even faking it Then you'll see the real me Then you'll see what we can do Maybe someday we'll get it down And make the talking linger on Hoping it'll lead us there Then you'll see what we can do Do you believe in art Do you believe in art Do you believe in art If you can see right through the chance And never take the fun away Hoping it will lead us there Then you'll see what we can do Do you believe in art Do you believe in art Do you believe in art Cake shop girls grow fingernails Dead long and rather sharp They paint them glace cherry red And yellow marzipan Scoring lines upon the backs Of tender chocolate mice I would like to buy a wedding cake for you and me!You've always been a cake shop girl as far as I recall Ballroom dancer minatures alongside cherokees Cake shop girl, oh cake shop girl I'd fall on bended knees I should like to buy a wedding cake for you and me Confectioners don't eat a thing That's made inside their shops Bottles of crushed beetle Can be bought to turn things red Window front displays are made For only perfect things I should like to substitute a cake for you and me Written by Jowe HeadSolid in those waters You were shattered and you lost your name Cutting lines you shot the channel Pushing out the galleons In a midget submarine Midget submarine So much like escape Sleeping in a moving train With ammunition and the other guns Diving out of games With all those stens and always so amazed In a midget submarine Midget submarine It's all escape Sitting there in fashion Just so pretty, so real, amazed Cases of the cargo All in canvas with galleons and tanks In a midget submarine Midget submarine It's all escapeWhy's our little one taking so long In the shower tonight It might just have been something to do With turning off the light She said something about Wanting to jump and shout She gets a real charge From the radio Why's our little one taking so long On the stairs tonight She told me it was far too late To put things right She said something about Wanting to jump and shout She gets a real charge From the radio Why's our little one taking so long In the bath tonight It might just have been something to do With turning off the light I always understood That we knew where we stood You get no leeway You get no time to change your waysGot a Rolls Royce It's driving me wild I never thought about it Got a space Between my eyes And I never knew about it No more ways To excavate you There's no two ways about it I think that's all There is to say Nothing more, oh, oh no Go away and play Little boys today, go HoorayI wanna spend some time with you Not now, but just another day It's much more fun just playing games With someone else's face No one waiting for my show It's still the second game No commitment, token drifting Round and round, still E-T-C I wanna live my life with you Not really, just sounds good A word to say to pass the time'Til all the trains have gone Just to spend some time with you Not now, but just another day No more waiting, you can't control it But everything is really great This is just another song I guess, it's rather long This is just another song And now it's gonna stopI got a full moon I got a full moon I got a full moon in my tail light I got a full moon in my port sight I got a full moon in my port sight I got a full moon in my tail light I got a full moon I got a full moon
