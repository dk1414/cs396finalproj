You're the direction I follow to get home When I feel like I can't go on, you tell me to go And it's like I can't feel a thing without you around And don't mind me if I get weak in the knees'Cause you have that effect on me, you do Everything you say Every time we kiss I can't think straight But I'm okay And I can't think of anybody else Who I hate to miss As much as I hate missing you Months going strong now and no goodbye Unconditional, unoriginal, always by my side Meant to be together, meant for no one but each other You love me, I love you harder so Everything you say Every time we kiss I can't think straight But I'm okay And I can't think of anybody else Who I hate to miss As much as I hate missing youYou were talkin' to her But messin' with me It's finally clear You're blurring the lines Are you disturbed Oh, now you care Why do you race through my red lights Can't understand I'll slow it down for you Tell me, how can you sleep How can you breathe Baby, tell me how How you love me now Tell me, how can you sleep How can you breathe I hate when you say How you love me now Homecoming, I'm coming, my sweet mistake Summer's over, hope it's not too late I'm pacing, impatient, up in my head Taken back to the sidewalk where we met And carved out our names Do you remember that I'm coming home, I'm coming home Did you take off while I was gone I missed it all, I messed you up, I missed you I'm coming home, I wanna know When all the leaves begin to fall If I'm falling, falling apart for you Descending, I'm spinning, lost all defense How could you swallow me again I left you, I meant to, couldn't let you in Never mind a single word I said Carve out your name Do you remember that I'm coming home, I'm coming home Did you take off while I was gone I missed it all, I messed you up, I missed you I'm coming home, I wanna know When all the leaves begin to fall If I'm falling, falling apartI am restless and I keep trembling Everyone watch me as I descend Into a feeling that's overwhelming me I finally stopped, stopped making sense I can't stop talking to myself I'm a desperate cry for help Run, don't walk, the sky is falling through Don't talk tonight, I'm so confused, I'm lost, I'm lost with you I don't care where we are or where we're headed to But I know I'm lost, I'm lost with you, with you Your mouth keeps moving, but I've lost focus now Clock keeps ticking, time's running out Where we're headed, there is no heading back Tripping ugly, I'm losing ground I can't stop talking to myself I'm a desperate cry for help Run, don't walk, the sky is falling through Don't talk tonight, I'm so confused, I'm lost, I'm lost with you I don't care where we are or where we're headed to But I know I'm lost, I'm lost with you, with youThe power lines went out And I am all alone But I don't really care at all Not answering my phone All the games you played The promises you made Couldn't finish what you started Only darkness still remains Lost sight Couldn't see When it was you and me Blow the candles out Looks like a solo tonight I'm beginning to see the light Blow the candles out Looks like a solo tonight But I think I'll be alright Been black and blue before There's no need to explain I am not the jaded kind Playback's such a waste You're invisible Invisible to me My wish is coming true Erase the memory of your faceYou, you hit with me a break And now you’re back for more Your song’s the same Leave me with all the blame I don’t have time for another game I don't wanna dance So don't you ask me, babe I don't wanna dance You blew your chance To rock my night away I want some fun Boy, you’re so not the one I don’t wanna dance So let it go You'll never take me home Take me home Take me home Talk to me without a sound'Cause you were such a tool Who's sorry now You, you're shaking on the floor Watch me walking out the doorLet's make a mess, steal a kiss in the moment You and me, everything that it could be Touch don't go, stay as long as you like Let's get reckless, dance with our hands to the beat Don't let this slip through our fingers It feels insane, don't you put up a fight Let's rough it up 'til they shut it down It's oh-oh-obvious right here's where the party starts With you and me, all alone No one has to know It's oh-oh-obvious to me How it's gonna be Oh-oh-obvious when you come close to me Let's make a scene like movies in our dreams Make me scream, take me down, no one's watching Close your eyes, play it back and rewind So surreal as the story unfolds on the screen Stop stalling the credits are rolling Hold me now before we run out of time Let's rough it up 'til the end of the nightO-o-oh-ooooh-oh O-o-oh-ooooh-oh Here's my heart in a postcard, darling Just one step from the edge Sleep alone and it's so hard, darling You're next to me in my head But it's too late, too late to call Are you out there Too late, too much to say Wish you were here Wish you well If you'd only share this hell But you leave, and stains are left on me I wish you, I wish you were here I wish you, I wish you were here O-o-oh-ooooh-oh O-o-oh-ooooh-ohOh  Oh  Shouts out to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino!Homecoming, I'm coming, my sweet mistake Summer's over, hope it's not too late I'm pacing, impatient, up in my head Taken back to the sidewalk where we met And carved out our names Do you remember that I'm coming home, I'm coming home Did you take off while I was gone I missed it all, I messed you up I missed you I'm coming home, I wanna know When all the leaves begin to fall If I'm falling, falling Apart for you It's Decaydance Records, suckers Hit me out of nowhere like a car crash on the street Suddenly colliding into me Now I'm broken, bruised and beat up Tangled in my sheets How can this feel so bad when you seemed so good for me Oh my god, what's wrong with my head Sweating with the chills, still in my bed Tell me how I'll ever make it through It's the short hellos and the long goodbyes The shake in my lip from the look in your eyes Makes me wanna die I've got the worst hangover from you Ooh, whoa, oh Ooh, whoa, oh Ooh, whoa, oh Swimming in the deep, tryna keep from turning blue Danger, danger, hoping not to drown Sinking in the quicksand just to walk right up to you You're so easy to pick up and so hard to put down
