One day you're up and the next day you're down You can't face the world with your head to the ground The grass is always greener on the other side, they say So don't worry, boys, life will be sweet some day Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh We made enough mistakes But you know we got what it takes Oh, we ain't got nothin' yet No, we ain't got nothin' yet Nothin' can hold us and nothin' can keep us down And someday our names will be spread all over town We can get in while the getting is good So make it on your own, yeah, you know that you could Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh We got to make the break'Cause we got too much at stake Oh, we ain't got nothin' yet No, we ain't got nothin' yet We made enough mistakes But you know we got what it takes Oh, we ain't got nothin' yet No, we ain't got nothin' yetSometimes I think about Old folks back home That 12 mile road that I used to roam Sometimes I think about That girl named Willie Jean Wondering if she made it down To New Orleans Whenever I think about The folks back there You know I wonder If they still have that old county fair Sometimes I think about That girl named Willie Jean Wondering if she made it down To New Orleans We used to watch river boats From a grassy bank Drinking hot water From a railroad filling tank Sometimes I think about That girl named Willie Jean Wondering if she made it down To New OrleansI'm looking for loving And I'd like to stay I'm hoping you'll want me And show me the way Touch me and give me sight You are the queen of my night It's evening, it's morning I walk out her sun Enchanted we wonder Now that we've begun As you come to me You are the painter of my dreams As you cling to me You are the keeper of the keys My searching is over I can tell by your sighs And then there is laughter Of dawn in your eyes Touch me and give me sight You are the queen of my nightThere's something about the way you walk that drives me insane There's something about the way you talk that gets to my brain But let me tell you baby Although you turn me on Come tomorrow night You must be gone She's coming home She's coming home She's coming home She's been my woman for so long And I've been a man To leave her now would be so wrong Can't you understand You know I owe that woman more than just goodbye So little girl now you gotta step aside She's coming home She's coming home She's coming home When I was down with no where to turn She kept me from going astray Now that I can make it alone It ain't right to throw her away I'm asking you to give me time to tell her we're through I can't let her come home and find that I'm here with youWrinkles on my face A grey hair's taking place It's hard to believe this is me Remembering the time When youth was a mine And I was fancy-free Well, you're getting old So I've been told Sit back and don't be afraid Another day goes by And you still wonder why You're getting closer to the grave Time bends your back And makes you look at The young and their carefree ways Well, you're getting old So I've been told Sit back and don't be afraid Another day goes by And you still wonder why You're getting closer to your graveIt's gonna take a lot more than magic To break this spell I know I'm gonna be in for a lot of trouble I can tell'Cause they gave you more than a girl should have You're feeling so good, I never felt so bad Gotta get away I wanna be free Gotta get away It's gonna take more than a doctor To ease this pain I know I better make up my mind to split babe Before I go insane'cause I'm getting addicted to your brand of love I'm getting so weak, I better hurry up Gotta get away I wanna be free Gotta get away Save me, before it's too late I said save me somebody, I got to get away'Cause they gave you more than a girl should have You're feeling so good, I never felt so bad Gotta get away I wanna be free Gotta get away I wanna be free Gotta get away I gotta get freeThat's all, folks I was born hot Sunday on Monday afternoon Into rigid rocks and lollipops Of a new moon unblue I can move a mountain yes I can I can move a mountain yes I can I grew stronger one day when my Sunday turned to you All your climbing rides replaced my tides Of crystal top and blue I can move a mountain yes I can I can move a mountain yes I can There's a lantern somewhere That you and I must find And no splintered tears or icy fears Could melt into my mind I can move a mountain yes I can I can move a mountain yes I can I can move a mountain yes I can I can move a mountain yes I can I can move a mountain yes I can I can move a mountain yes I canWell, I went downtown And I got back late Found another way and she said"Darling, I can't wait"Well, let's get together, baby See what we can do I ain't worried 'bout nobody Only worry 'bout you I know my belle told me She said, "Darling, listen Better come on home to me You don't what you're missing"We can get together, baby See what we can do I ain't worried 'bout nobody Only worry 'bout you And we can get together, baby See what we can do I, I, I ain't worried 'bout nobody Only worry 'bout you Well, I went downtown And I got back late Found another way  and she said Darling, I can't waitRain, rain from the sky In my magic land It isn't rain or rain at all Though all is coming down All that's coming from the sky Is tons and tons of frum This may seem mighty strange And comical to boot Life is just a Cher O' Bowlies Life is just a Cher O' Bowlies What's the use of singing this song Some of you aren't even listening Life is just a Cher O' Bowlies Life is just a Cher O' Bowlies Thank you
