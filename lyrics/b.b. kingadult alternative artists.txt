in the morning sleeping She's little and she loves me to my lucky day Hummingbird, don't fly away When I'm feeling wild and lonesome, she knows the words to say And she gives me a little understanding in her special way And I just have to say, in my life I loved a woman Because she's more than I deserve and she gets me where I live I'll give all I have to give, I'm talking about that hummingbird

and I got well paid I blew it all at the penny arcade A hundred dollars on a Kewpie doll No pretty chick is going to make me crawl Get on a T WA to the promised land Every woman, child and man Gets a Cadillac and a great big diamond ring Don't you know you're riding with the king He's on a mission of mercy to the new frontier He's going to check us all on out of here Up to that mansion on a hill Where you can get your prescription filled Get on a T WA to the promised land Everybody, everybody clap your hands And don't you doubt, love, the way that he sings Don't you know you're riding with the king Riding with the king Don't you know you're riding with the king A tuxedo and a shiny 335 You can see it in his face, the blues never lie Tonight everybody's getting their angel wings And don't you know we're riding with the king Give me that old time religion Give me that old time religion Give me that old time religion It is good enough for me It was good for my old mother It was

another one of those crazy dreams Oh, nothing is going right this morning The whole world is wrong it seems Oh, I guess it's the chain that binds me I can't shake it loose, these chains and things Got to work this morning Seems like everything is lost I got a gold-hearted, wrong-doing woman And a slave-driving ball I can't loosen these chains that bind me Can't shake them loose, these chains and things Just can't loosen these chains and things Well, you talk about hard luck and trouble Seems to be my middle name All the odds are against me Yes, I can only play a losing game These chains that bind me Can't loosen these chains and things Just can't loosen these chains and things Oh I would pack up and leave today, people But I ain't got nowhere to go Ain't got money to buy a ticket And I don't feel like walking anymore These chains that bind me I can't lose, I can't lose these chains and thingsThe thrill is gone The thrill is gone away The thrill is gone, baby The thrill is gone away You know you done me wrong, baby And you'll be sorry someday The thrill is gone It's gone away from me The thrill is gone, baby The thrill is gone away from me Although I'll still live on But so lonely I'll be The thrill is gone It's gone away for good Oh, the thrill is gone, baby It's gone away for good Someday, I know I'll be over it all, baby Just like I know a man shouldI've been down
