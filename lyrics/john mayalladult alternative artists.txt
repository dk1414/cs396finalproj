So many roads so many trains to ride So many roads so many trains to ride I've got to find my baby before I'll be satisfied I was standing by my window when I heard that whistle blow I was standing by my window when I heard that whistle blow You know I thought it was a streamline but it was a b and o It was a mean old fireman and a cruel old engineer It was a mean old fireman and a cruel old

so bad My mind's been broken my heart feels so sad Evil people well I can't even walk out of my door I ain't different from nobody and I just can't take no more I've got to leave where I'm going I don't know I've got to leave where I'm going I just don't know And I've had so much trouble I'm out of reach I can't take no moreI'm sittin' out here in the rain baby Under that old green tree I'm sittin' out here in the rain baby Under that old green tree I'm sittin' out here in the rain baby Wonderin' why you don't come back to me I got a blister on my heel baby Splinter run right thru my heart I got a blister on my heel baby Splinter run right thru my heart And I'm sittin' out here in the rain baby Wonderin' why you and me we had to part I'm so sorry baby we're not allowed to be Said I'm so sorry baby we're not allowed to be Gonna lock you in my arms baby, before I throw away the key I'm sittin' out here in the rain baby Under that old green tree I'm sittin' out here in the rain baby Under that old green tree Wonderin' why you don't come back to meMay seem peculiar How I think o'you If you want me, darlin'Here's what you must do You gotta give me'cause I can't give the best Unless I got room to move If you want me darlin'Take me how you can I'll be circulating'cause that's the way I am You gotta give me'cause I can't give the best Unless I got room to moveEach and every morning When the sun is high I hunt around the Canyon Till I find a place to lie Oh, oh, it's so beautiful to be alone Got the sun and trees and silence I'm in my Laurel Canyon home Looking back a century I look at where I stand It must have looked the same as when Apaches roamed the land Now the sun is sinking It's time to reminisce Here's a way of living That I will sorely missI'm waiting For the right time If we meet Wonder what I'll find It's all in my head But I wish she could be mine, yeah Hiding, all the love inside It's hell to know She doesn't know But I want to tell you She drives me out of my mind I'm waiting For love to come my way So I wrote her a letter the other day So many things that I wanted to say to her Maybe now the pain will go away It's hell to know She doesn't know But I want to tell you She drives me out of my mind I'm waiting How long is it gonna be A face in a crowd Does she ever noticed me We never met, so wish she a fantasy How can I know, I'll have to wait and seeI let a life slip through my fingers Where am I gonna turn I'm the causing of the trouble And it makes my poor heart burn I been tryin' to tell you people That the blues hit me in my life You know I was born for trouble And it's a hard road till I die I've loved and lost so many women The cause of many broken heart Drank and drifted through the years And watched my family fall apart I'm gonna pack up my suitcase Put my misery inside Throw in a bit of pain and trouble And that's the road I'll ride
