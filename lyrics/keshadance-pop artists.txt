and play along with me tonight I'd forgot how to daydream So consumed with the wrong things But in the dark, I realized this life is short And deep down, I'm still a child Playful eyes, wide and wild I can't lose hope, what's left of my heart's still made of goldBeen a prisoner of the past Had a bitterness when I looked back Was telling everyone it's not that bad’Til all my shit hit the fan I know I'm always like Telling everybody, "You don't gotta be a victim"Life ain’t always fair, but hell is living in resentment Choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you I think it's time to practice what I preach Exorcise the demons inside me Whoa, gotta learn to let it go The past can't haunt me if I don't let it Live and learn and never forget it Whoa, gotta learn to let it go Had a boogeyman under my bed Putting crazy thoughts inside my head Always whispering, "It's all your fault"He was telling me, "No, you're not that strong"There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free-for-all When they—When the dark of the night Comes around, that's the time That the animal comes alive Lookin' for somethin' wild And now we lookin' like pimps in my gold Trans Am Got a water bottle full of whiskey in my handbag Got my drunk text on, I'll regret it in the mornin'But tonight, I don't give a​—There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free-for-all And they turn me on when they take it off When they take it off, everybody take it off There's a place I know if you're lookin' for a show Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor And they turn me on when they take it off When they take it off, everybody take it offMaybe I need some rehab Or maybe just need some sleep I got a sick obsession I'm seein' it in my dreams I'm lookin' down every alley I'm makin' those desperate calls I'm stayin' up all night hopin'Hittin' my head against the wall What you've got, boy, is hard to find I think about it all the time I'm all strung out, my heart is fried I just can't get you off my mind Because your love, your love, your love is my drug Your love, your love, your love I said your love, your love, your love is my drug Your love, your love, your love Won't listen to any advice Momma's tellin' me I should think twice But left to my own devices I'm addicted, it's a crisis My friends think I've gone crazy My judgment's gettin' kinda hazy My steeze is gonna be affected If I keep it up like a lovesick crackheadI'm not a stranger to the dark"Hide away," they say"'Cause we don't want your broken parts"I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars"Run away," they say"No one'll love you as you are"But I won't let them break me down to dust I know that there's a place for us For we are glorious When the sharpest words wanna cut me down I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown 'em out I am brave, I am bruised I am who I'm meant to be, this is me Look out 'cause here I come And I'm marchin' on to the beat I drum I'm not scared to be seen I make no apologies, this is me Oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
