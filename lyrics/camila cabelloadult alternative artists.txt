Like I knew you would And we're both wild And the night's young And you're my drug Breathe you in 'til my face numb Drop it down to that bass drum I got what you dream about Nails scratchin' my back tatt Eyes closed while you scream out And you keep me in with those hips While my teeth sink in those lips While your body's giving me life And you suffocate in my kiss Then you saidSomethin' must've gone wrong in my brain Got your chemicals all in my veins Feelin' all the highs, feelin' all the pain Let go of the wheel, that's the bullet lane Now I'm seein' red, not thinkin' straight Blurrin' all the lines, you intoxicate me Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need All I need Yeah, you're all I need It's you, babe And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe And I could try to run, but it would be useless You're to blame Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same It's you, babe And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe And I could try to run, but it would be useless You're to blame Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the sameYou think that you'll die without him You know, that's a lie that you tell yourself You fear that you lay alone forever now It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, nah So put your arms around me tonight Let the music lift you up like you've never been so high Open up your heart to me Let the music lift you up like you've never been this free'Til you feel the sunrise Let the music warm your body like the heat of a thousand fires The heat of a thousand fires Ain't no crying in the club, hey, hey Let the beat carry away, your tears as they fall, baby Ain't no crying in the club, hey, hey With a little faith, your tears turn to ecstasy Ain't no crying in the club I won't, I won't, I...Ain't no crying in the club I won't, I won't, I...Ain't no crying in the clubNo, I think I'll stay in tonight Skip the conversations and the "Oh, I'm fine's"No, I'm no stranger to surprise This paper town has let me down too many times Why do I even try Give me a reason why I thought that I could trust you, never mind Why all the switching sides Where do I draw the line I guess I'm too naive to read the signs I'm just lookin' for some real friends All they ever do is let me down Every time I let somebody in Then I find out what they're all about I'm just lookin' for some real friends Wonder where they're all hidin' out I'm just lookin' for some real friends Gotta get up out of this town Oh, yeah"]Hey Havana, ooh na-na Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na He took

Don't run , no, don't hide Been running from it for the longest time So many mornings I woke up confused In my dreams, I do anything I want to you My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind Right now, I'm shameless Screamin' my lungs out for ya Not afraid to face it I need you more than I want to Need you more than I want to Show me you're shameless Write it on my neck, why don't ya And I won't erase it I need you more than I want to Need you more than I want to No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this nowDirty tissues, trust issues Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed Little voices in my head Secret keeping, stop the bleeding Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating All the songs that I can't listen to, to tell the truth Loving you was young, and wild, and free Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound A steady place to let down my defenses But loving you had consequences Hesitation, awkward conversation Running on low expectation Every siren that I was ignoring I'm paying for it Loving you was young, and wild, and free Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound A steady place to let down my defenses But loving you had consequences
