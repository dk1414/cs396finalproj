age of eighteen She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen I was introduced and we both started groovin'She said, "I dig you baby, but I got to keep movin' on Keep movin' on"Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again Well, I don't know, but I've been told You never slow down, you never grow old I'm tired of

keep Oh yeah, all right Take it easy, baby Make it last all night She was an American girl Well, it was kinda cold that night She stood alone on her balcony Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by Out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach And for one desperate moment there He crept back in her memory God, it's so painful when something that is so close Is still so far out of reachOh baby, don't

The future was wide open They moved into a place they both could afford He found a night club he could work at the door She had a guitar and she taught him some chords The sky was the limit Into the great wide open Under them skies of blue Out in the great wide open A rebel without a clue The papers said Ed always played from the heart He got an agent and a roadie named Bart They made a record and it went in the charts The sky was the limit His leather jacket had chains that would jingle They both met movie stars, partied and mingled Their A&R man said, "I don't hear a single"The future was wide open One, two You better watch what you say You better watch what you do to me Don't get carried away Girl, if you can do better than me Go Yeah, go But remember Good love is hard to find Good love is hard to find You got lucky, babe You got lucky, babe When I found you You put a hand on my cheek And then you turned your eyes away If you don't feel complete If I don't take you all of the wayYou know sometimes, I don't know why But this old town just seems so hopeless I ain't really sure, but it seems I remember the good times Were just a little bit more in focus But when she puts her arms around me I can somehow rise above it Yeah, man, when I got that little girl standin' right by my side You know, I can tell the whole wide world to shove it, hey!Here comes my girl Here comes my girl Yeah, and she looks so right She is all I need tonight Every now and then I get down to the end of the day I have to stop and ask myself why I've done it It just seems so useless to have to work so hard And nothin' ever really seems to come from it And then she looks me in the eye and says, "We're gonna last forever"And man, you know I can't begin to doubt it No, 'cause it just feels so good, and so free, and so right I know we ain't never gonna change our minds about it, hey Hey!Hey!Don't come around here no more Don't come around here no more Whatever you're looking for Hey  Don't come
