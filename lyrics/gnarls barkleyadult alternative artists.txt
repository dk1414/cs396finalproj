I remember when I remember, I remember when I lost my mind There was something so pleasant about that place Even your emotions have an echo, in so much space, mmm And when you're out there without care Yeah, I was out of touch But it wasn't because I didn't know enough I just knew too much, mm Does that make me crazy Does that make me crazy Does that make me crazy Possibly And I hope that you are having the time of your life But think twice, that's my only advice, mm Come on now, who do you Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul You really think you're in control Well, I think you're crazy I think you're crazy I think you're crazy Just like meI've seen it with my own eyes how we're getting otherwise Without the luxury of leaving The touch and feeling of free is intangible, technically Something you've got to believe in Connect the cause and effect, one foot in front of the next This is the start of a journey And my mind is already gone, and the fear of the unknown Somehow just doesn't concern me And you can stand right there if you want But I'm going on And I'm prepared to go it alone I'm going on To a place in the sun that's nice and warm I'm going on And I'm sure they'll have a place for you, too, ooh Anyone that needs what they want and doesn't want what they need I want nothing to do with I aim to do what I want, and to do what I please Is first off my to-do list But every once in a while, I think about her smile One of the few things I do miss But, baby, I've got to go, baby, I've got to know Baby, I've got to prove it I got some bad news, this morning Which, in turn, made my day When this someone spoke, I listened All of a sudden has less, and less to say Oh, how could this be All this time, I've lived vicariously Who's gonna save my soul, now Who's gonna save my soul, now How will my story ever be told, now How will my story be told, now Made me feel like somebody Hmm, like somebody else Although he was imitated often It felt like I was bein' myself Is it a shame that someone else's song Was totally and completely depended on Who's gonna save my soul, now Who's gonna save my soul, now I wonder if I'll live to grow old, now Gettin' high 'cause I feel so low downWhat did you do  What did you say Did you walk or did you run away Where are you now  Where have you been Did you go alone or did you bring a friend I need to know this 'cause I noticed that you're smilin'Out in the sun, havin' fun and feelin' free And I can tell you know how hard this life can be But you keep on smilin' for me Girl, let me smile at you Girl, let me smile at you What went right  What went wrong Was it a story or was it a song Was it overnight or did it take you long Was knowing your weakness what made you strong Or all the above  Oh, how I love to see you smilin'And, oh yeah, take a little pain, just in case You need something warm to embrace To help you put on a smilin' face Hey, put on a smilin' faceAll I want is your understanding As in the small act of affection"Why is this my life "Is almost everybody's question And I've tried Everything but suicide But it's crossed my mind I prefer peace Wouldn't have to have one worldly possession But, essentially, I'm an animal So, just what do I do with all the aggression Well, I've tried Everything but suicide But it's crossed my mind Life is a one-way street, and if you could paint it I'd draw myself going in the right direction So, I go all the way, like I really, really know But the truth is, I'm only guessin'I packed a few of my belongings Left the life that I was living Just some memories of it Mostly, the ones I can't forget Ah, whenever you need me, I'll be here Until then, my dear I'm going, I'm going, going there Don't ask me to make time, to travel back and forth Let nature take its course Maybe I'm open from all this ocean air And if it weren't for you I'd be without a care Settin' sail to St  Elsewhere, yeah Anywhere you sit, you can see the sun Unfortunately, on this island, I'm the only one Same rules apply on a rainy day And it's not such a pretty place to be It just rains, and rains, and rains, on me Send a simple sign I can understand Then a flower grew out that sand Before you know it, I was back out on that seaBasically, I'm complicated I have a hard time taking the easy way I wouldn't call it schizophrenia But I'll be at least two people today If that's okay And I could go on and on and on But who cares It's deep how you can be so shallow And I'm afraid 'cause I have no fear And I didn't believe in magic Until I watched you disappear I wish you were here And I could go on and on and on But who cares You see, everybody is somebody But nobody wants to be themselves Ooh, and if I ever wanted to understand me I'd have to talk to someone else'Cause every little bit helpsYeah, it's still the same, can't you feel the pain When the needle hits the vein, ain't nothing like the real thing I've seen it once before and, oh, it's something else, good God Cool breeze, come on in; sunshine, come on down These are the teardrops of a clown, the circus is comin' to town All I'm sayin' is sometimes, I'm more scared of myself, you better I said  Run away Run away Run, children Run for your life Run away Run away Run, children Oh Here it comes, said run Alright Yeah, I'm on the run; see where I'm comin' from When you see me comin', run before you see what I'm runnin' from No time for question askin', time is passin' by, alright You can't win, child, we've all tried to You've been lied to, it's already inside you Either you run right now or you best get ready to die, you better I said, Ooh, good LordI, I, I I-I-I know how to transform I transform, I transform I'm a transformer I, I, I I-I-I know how to transform I transform , I transform I'm a transformer I'm just being myself Plus, I gotta be me, too Silly of me to think that I couldn't bring myself to be you Ah, but behold, there is benevolence behind this But don't stare, though Be careful, 'cause I'll kill you with kindness That's why I'm dressed quite neatly'Cause it's easy and discreetly, they seek me And when they reach me and see me They believe me, completely I'm a real live wire, I ain't lying If it's between me and you, I ain't dying I can transform, I can transform, I can transform without even trying I, I, I I-I-I know how to transform I transform, I transform I'm a transformer I, I, I I-I-I know how to transform I transform, I transform I'm a transformerI could paint a picture with a pen But a song will only scratch the skin And there are still places I haven't been Because I know what's in there is already in the air Oh yeah, there's a storm on the way There's a storm on the way, alright There's a storm on the way, uh huh And it's comin' no matter what I say Hey, hey, hey There's truth in the thunder, love in the lightning The feeling is frightening, yet isn't it exciting I'm something like stormy weather; if I weren't, we would never Huddle together; do I have to tell you That I'm also the sunlight that shines shortly after I just rain 'cause I have to, on to a new chapter I wish you lots of laughter 'til the next time you see me Just remember you need me, I'm the storm coming Oh, come on Come on
