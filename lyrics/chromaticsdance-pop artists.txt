Cherry Tells me some things I don't want to know And I can't see A light at the end for us anymore But I can't keep crying All of the time No, I can't keep crying All of the time Cherry Can be very sweet when she needs a friend But it's only A mask that she wears so she can pretend And I can't keep running All of the time No, I can't keep running All of the time Cherry I hate that it's true but you make me blue I kept waiting For you to find what I see in youMy, my, hey, hey Rock and roll is here to stay It's better to burn out, than to fade away My, my, hey, hey Out of the blue, into the black They give you this but you pay for that Once you're gone you can never come back When you're out of the blue, into the black The King is gone but he's not forgotten This is the story of Johnny Rotten It's better to burn out than it is to rust The King is gone but he's not forgotten Hey, hey, my, my Rock and Roll can never die There's more to the picture, than meets the eye Hey, hey, my, myShadow, take me down Shadow, take me down with you For the last time, for the last time For the last time, for the last time You're in the water, I'm standing on the shore Still thinking that I hear your voice Can you hear me, can you hear me Can you hear me, can you hear me For the last time, for the last time For the last time, for the last time At night I'm driving in your car Pretending that we'll leave this town We're watching all the street lights fade And now you're just a stranger's dream I took your picture from the frame And now you're nothing like you seem Your shadow fell like last night's rain For the last time, for the last time For the last time, for the last timeEverybody’s got a secret to hide Everyone is slipping backwards I drank the water and I felt alright I took a pill almost every night In my mind I was waiting for change While the world just stayed the same Everybody’s got a secret to hide Everyone is slipping backwards I can’t remember if I like what I said I can’t remember it went straight to my head I kept a bottle by the foot of the bed I put a pillow right on top of my head But I killed for love Everybody’s got a secret to hide Everyone is slipping backwards You say you see it almost every time A little number counting back to nine I can’t remember if I like what I said I can’t remember it went straight to my head But I killed for loveHey little girl, is your daddy home Will he go away and leave you all alone I got a bad desire Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire Tell me now baby, is he good to you Does he do to you the things that I do Oh no, I can take you higher Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire Sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull And cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my soul At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet And a freight train running through the middle of my head Only you can cool my desire Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fireIt didn't hurt me But you wanna feel how it feels But you wanna know that it didn't hurt me But you wanna hear about the deal they're making, oh You It's you and me It's you and me who won't be unhappy And if I only could I'd make a deal with God And I'd get him to swap our places Be running up that road Be running up that hill Be running up that building Do you wanna hurt me Let's see how deep the bullet lies Unaware I'm tearing you asunder There is thunder in our hearts Is there so much hate for the ones we love Tell me we both matter, don't we When I came to this world I arrived in a car I was a boy I was a girl Pyramid glass Scraping the sky See our reflection Cast no reflection I want your love I want your love I want your love I want your love When I came to this world I arrived in a storm Alone in the rain Falling out from the clouds Voice on the radio Crying 96 tears See our reflection Cast no reflectionBetween her dreams and oxygen The end is all she ever asked Engine's warm, it's dark outside A hidden tear behind her mask Black walls closing in again Losing sleep and lost in time She'll close her eyes and unlock mine She turns water into wine And she says she's no substitute And she's always dropping blue And they say there's no reward for you But all their lies end on a Monday Black walls closing in again Losing sleep and lost in time She'll close her eyes and unlock mine She turns water into wine And she says she's no substitute And she's always dropping blue And they say there's no reward for you But all their lies end on a MondayI know you're no good, no But I can't stay away from you I know you're no good, no But I can't stay away from you That's all we ever do That's all we ever do, oh-oh That's all we ever do That's all we ever do, oh-oh Ever do, ever do, ever do Ever do, ever do, ever do Ever do, ever do, ever do Ever do, ever do, ever do We sleep until the sun goes down We watch the night fall on the ground And are we all alone I know you're no good, no But I can't stay away from you I know you're no good, no I can't stay away
