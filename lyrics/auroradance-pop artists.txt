I was listenin' to the ocean I saw a face in the sand But when I picked it up Then it vanished away from my hands, dah I had a dream I was seven Climbin' my way in a tree I saw a piece of heaven Waitin' in patience for me, dah And I was runnin' far away Would I run off the world someday Nobody knows, nobody knows And I was dancing in the rain I felt alive and I can't complain But no, take me home Take me home where I belong I can't take it anymore I was painting a picture The picture was a painting of you And for a moment I thought you were here But then again, it wasn't true, dah And all this time I have been lyin'Oh, lyin' in secret to myself I've been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf La-di-daAh-ah, ah-ah Ah-ah, ah-ah Ah-ah, ah-ah, oh I can hear you, but I won't Some look for trouble while others don't There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day And ignore your whispers, which I wish would go away, oh Ah-ah, ah-ah Oh-oh Ah-ah, ah-ah You're not a voice, you're just a ringing in my ear And if I heard you, which I don't, I'm spoken for, I fear Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls I'm sorry, secret siren, but I'm blocking out your calls I've had my adventure, I don't need something new I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow youGo row the boat to safer grounds But don't you know we're stronger now My heart still beats and my skin still feels My lungs still breathe, my mind still fears But we're runnin' out of time All the echoes in my mind cry There's blood on your lies The skies open wide There is nowhere for you to hide The hunter's moon is shinin'I'm running with the wolves tonight I'm running with the wolves I'm running with the wolves tonight I'm running with the wolves I'm running with the Trick or treat, what would it be I walk alone, I'm everything My ears can hear and my mouth can speak My spirit talks, I know my soul believes But we're runnin' out of time All the echoes in my mind cryJust like the seed I don't know where to go Through dirt and shadow, I grow I'm reaching light through the struggle Just like the sea I'm chasing the wonder I unravel myself All in slow motion You cannot eat money, oh no You cannot eat money, oh no When the last tree has fallen And the rivers are poisoned You cannot eat money, oh no You cannot eat money, oh no You cannot eat money, oh no When the last tree has fallen And the rivers are poisoned You cannot eat money, oh no Oh no Suffocate me So my tears can be rain I will water the ground where I stand So the flowers can grow back again'Cause just like the sea Everything wants to live We are burning our fingers But we learn and forgive, ahFive, four, three, two, one Five, four, three, two, one He holds the gun against my head I close my eyes and "bang", I am dead I know he knows that he's killing me for mercy And here I go Oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh And here I go Oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh He holds my body in his arms He didn't mean to do no harm And he holds me tight He did it all to spare me from the awful things in life that comes And he cries and cries I know he knows that he's killing me for mercyBroken mornings, broken nights and broken days in between Open ground, the sky is open, makes an open scene Just like in fiction, in every addiction Oh, fantasy's taking over, awake me I've been looking for the conqueror But you don't seem to come my way I've been looking for the only one But you don't seem to come my way Broken me and broken them And you are broken too Open ears, their eyes are open Makes me call for you But there's no seduction, only destruction Oh, fantasy, take me over and break me I've been looking for the conqueror But you don't seem to come my way I've been looking for the only one But you don't seem to come my way I've been looking for the conqueror But you don't seem to come my way I've been looking for the only one But you don't seem to come my way Walking in my sleep Like the naked trees Will they wake up again Do they sleep, do they dream Feel it as the wind strokes my skin I am moved by the chill Hear the winter bird sing Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah My tears are always frozen I can see the air I breathe Got my fingers painting pictures On the glass in front of me Lay me by the frozen river Where the boats have passed me by All I need is to remember How it was to feel alive Silent days, violent shades We are dancing again In a dream, by the lakeCan you tell if I'm cold If I'm out of daydreams If I lose what is loved Will a new love awake me I am touched by wonder When I'm blind in the dark But you drown me in daylight Don't swim with me darling I prefer the sound of you When you are away If I am left with a rose in my hand, let it die It's the beauty in forgotten love And I don't care if you don't understand why I cry It's the beauty in forgotten love I forget how emotions dance when they aren't inside of me I forget how the sun feels when she isn't around me And my dreams become sweeter when something is missing I'm in love with the hunt itself It makes me feel alive, aliveEyes blue and hollow As it rains against their will Feathers falling out of a pillow As if time's standing still I can't remember much more But I know it happened quiet So quiet Words falling out through the window All that remains is a silent call Is the Earth colored red As I land like a flower on the meadow Love is wild You fell apart Like a stone can be broken into sand A thousand pieces Spread across a crying land And you can't remember that day But you know it happened quiet So quietI was listenin' to the ocean I saw a face in the sand But when I picked it up Then it vanished away from my hands, dah I had a dream I was seven Climbin' my way in a tree I saw a piece of heaven Waitin' in patience for me, dah And I was runnin' far away Would I run off the world someday Nobody knows, nobody knows And I was dancing in the rain I felt alive and I can't complain But no, take me home Take me home where I belong I can't take it anymore I was painting a picture The picture was a painting of you And for a moment I thought you were here But then again, it wasn't true, dah And all this time I have been lyin'Oh, lyin' in secret to myself I've been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf La-di-da
