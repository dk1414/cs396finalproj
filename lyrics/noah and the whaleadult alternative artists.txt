Oh well, in five years time, we could be walking 'round a zoo With the sun shining down over me and you And there'll be love in the bodies of the elephants too And I'll put my hands over your eyes, but you'll peep through And there'll be sun, sun, sun all over our bodies And sun, sun, sun  all down our necks And there'll sun, sun, sun  all over our faces And sun, sun, sun - so what the heck!'Cause I'll be laughing at all your silly little jokes And we'll be laughing about how we used to smoke All those stupid little cigarettes and drink stupid wine'Cause it's what we needed to have a good time But it was fun, fun, fun when we were drinking It was fun, fun, fun when we were drunk And it was fun, fun, fun when we were laughing It was fun, fun, fun; oh it was fun Oh well, I look at you and say It's the happiest that I've ever been And I'll say I no longer feel I have to be James Dean And she'll say "Yeah, well, I feel all pretty happy too And I'm always pretty happy when I'm just kicking back with you"Lisa likes brandy and the way it hits her lips She's a rock'n'roll survivor with pendulum hips She's got deep brown eyes that've seen it all Working at a nightclub that was called "The Avenue"The bar men used to call her "Little Lisa, Looney Tunes"She went down on almost anyone And from the hard time living 'til the Chelsea days From when her hair was sweet blonde 'til the day it turned gray She said L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N You've got more than money and sense, my friend You've got heart and you go in your own way L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N What you don't have now will come back again You've got heart and you go in your own way Some people wear their history like a map on their face And Joey was an artist just living out of case But his best work was his letters home Extended works of fiction about imaginary success When chorus girls in neon were his closest things to friends But to a writer, the truth is no big deal And from the hard time living to the sleepless nights And the black and blue body from the weekend fights He'd say L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N You've got more than money and sense, my friend You've got heart and you go in your own way L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N What you don't have now will come back again You've got heart and you go in your own way On my last night on Earth, I won't look to the sky Just breathe in the air and blink in the light On my last night on Earth, I'll pay a high price To have no regrets and be done with my life L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N You've got more than money and sense, my friend You've got heart and you go in your own way L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N What you don't have now will come back again You've got heart and you go in your own wayLooking through the photos you find in my drawer Laughing so hard you're rolling around on the floor At all the bad haircuts And smoking cigarettes The lustless romantic Trying hard to impress Well that's just me, before we met Well that's just me, before we met Putting down the photos, you look up at me Enjoying the thought of the person that I used to be The things I was proud of The things I regret Some things I remember Some things I forget Well that's just me, before we met Well that's just me, before we met But that's just me, before we met But that's just me, before we met Well I've always had a wild imagination And it sees through your heart Which I know can be, a wild combination Like a flame forms from a spark But don't be shy, be brave, little champion It's better to live than to hideWell he used to be somebody And now he's someone else Took apart his old life Left it on the shelf Sick of being someone He did not admire Took up all his old things Set em all on fire He's gonna change Gonna change his ways Gonna change Gonna change his ways And it feels like his new life can start And it feels like heaven Left his house at midnight Resolute and young In search of something greater Than the person he'd become Threw his bags on to the back Of his run down eighties car Headed out to god knows where The distance is too farThis is a song for anyone With a broken heart This is a song for anyone Who can't get out of bed I'll do anything To be happy Oh, 'cause blue skies are coming But I know that it's hard This is the last song that I write While still in love with you This is the last song that I write While you're even on my mind Cause it's time to leave Those feelings behind Oh, 'cause blue skies are coming But I know that it's hardYour parents hide They live in fear They’re lying restless as the dawn gets near You wanna live You wanna try You hear the whisper of the world outside So take a chance and leave tonight Sarah’s waiting in a car outside You bumped the door Your father wakes You let your anger and your sadness break And when you turn around, he’s laid down on the ground And now you’re standing with your finger on the pulse And then an open door, two footsteps on the floor And now you’re standing with your finger on the pulse It’s Sarah’s face, her worried eyes Pulls back the door and gently steps inside The nighttime with a charcoal grin The false diamonds on her pallid skinWell, I was looking for harvest, but I only found silver and gold Finding my way out, I was only fifteen years old Somebody asked me “What're gonna do with your life ”And I stared out into nothing, searching for the answer that’s right But it’s okay to not always be sure exactly where you wanna go And love may not be the cure, that’s something I’ll never know Oh, but show a little faith in me I’m standing right in front of you And show a little faith in me Over the passing of time Oh, my natural compulsion to try and swap kindness for truth It’s something inside me, maybe one day I’ll cut loose But don’t look for perfection, love pushes all that away The weak would surrender, if you feel brave then you’ll stay'Cos it’s okay to not always be sure exactly what it is you found And love may not be the cure, but it’s at least a common groundAre you lying in your bed alone tonight While he watches T V Can you hear it coming through the floorboards Why you’re thinking of me Everybody told you baby, you got married too young But you didn’t wanna listen, did you Thought you were right and they were wrong Jennifer, I know we were young But God only knows what we could’ve become That I hate to think about you lonely I’m stretched out, saying someone hold me tonight I only left six months ago now, now you’re wearing his ring It’s like it all never happened, like I didn’t mean a thing Remember the kiss down by the river, that ended up at your door And then the swift invitation to come up to the second floor Jennifer, you know where I am If you come and see me, I will understand That you, you’re in need, someone to talk to You just want my arms around youWe got high a thousand times in your brother’s room Talked about how we break free, guess it came too soon We grew up, drifted apart, now you’re getting married While I’m waiting for my life to start Are you ready to make that call It’s gonna be a lifetime It was only a few years ago, but it feels like a lifetime The year your brother left home is mostly you and me We spend our whole summer there on his balcony We were young, that was then And I can’t help the feeling that is never coming back again Are you ready to make that call It’s gonna be a lifetime It was only a few years ago, but it feels like a lifetime Are you ready to make that call It’s gonna be a lifetime It was only a few years ago, but it feels like a lifetime And we used to dream of what was beyond these walls And we used to pray that one day we’ll see them fall And there’ll be nothing, nothing but time And there’ll be nothing, nothing but timeIt's the first day of spring And my life is starting over again Where the trees grow, the river flows And its water will wash away my sins For I do believe that everyone Has one chance to fuck up their lives Like a cut down tree, I will rise again And I'll be bigger and stronger than ever before If I'm still here hoping that one day you may come back If I'm still here hoping that one day you may come back There's a hope in every new seed And every flower that grows upon the earth And though I love you, and you know that Well I no longer know what that's worth But I'll come back to you In a year or so And rebuild, ready to become The person you believed in The person that you used to love For I'm still here hoping that one day you may come back For I'm still here hoping that one day you may come back
