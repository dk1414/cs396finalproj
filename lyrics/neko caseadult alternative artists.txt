My true love drowned in a dirty old pan of oil That did run from the block Of a Falcon sedan 1969 The paper said '75 There were no survivors None found alive Trees break the sidewalk And the sidewalk skins my knees There's glass in my thermos And blood on my jeans Nickels and dimes of the Fourth of July Roll off in a crooked line To the chain-link lots where the red tails dive Oh, how I forgot what it's like Hey when she sings, when she sings When she sings like she runs Moves like she runs Hey when she moves, when she moves When she moves like she runs Moves like she runsChimney falls and lovers blaze Thought that I was young Now I've freezing hands and bloodless veins As numb as I've become I'm so tired I wish I was the moon tonight Last night I dreamt I'd forgotten my name'Cause I had sold my soul But I woke just the same I'm so lonely I wish I was the moon tonight God blessed me, I'm a free man With no place free to go Paralyzed and collared-tight No pills for what I fear This is crazy I wish I was the moon tonightThe most tender place in my heart is for strangers I know it's unkind but my own blood is much too dangerous Hangin' round the ceiling half the time Hangin' round the ceiling half the time Compared to some I've been around But I really tried so hard That echo chorus lied to me with its"Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on"In the end I was the mean girl Or somebody's in-between girl Now it's the devil I love And that's as funny as real love I leave the party at 3 A.M Alone, thank God With a valium from the bride It's the devil I love It's the devil I love And that's as funny as real love And that's as real as true love That echo chorus lied to me with its"Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on"That echo chorus lied to me with its"Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on"God is not a contract or a guy God is an unspecified tide You cannot time its tables It sets no glass or gables God is a lusty tire fire Its bristles scrape and strike the stage A rock-paper-scissors rage Have mercy on the natural world My voice is not the liquid waves The perfect rings 'round a heron's legs My voice a straight garroting wire A stolen mile of fingerprints Peeled up quiet from their dunes Captured and re-spooled as ruin To be used at a different time My voice is a fracture Of a shinbone's lust Pounding barefoot ground It lifts you up and sits you just Just at sorrow's waterline I drape you on tomorrow's plate Ferrous metal, marrow spilling Not yours, but mine I'm an agent of the natural worldMy love, I am the speed of sound I left them motherless, fatherless Their souls dangling inside-out from their mouths But it's never enough I want you I carved your name across three counties And ground it in with bloody hides Their broken necks will line the ditch'Til you "Stop it  Stop it  Stop this madness!"I want you I have waited with a glacier’s patience Smashed every transformer with every trailer'Til nothing was standing Sixty-five miles wide But still you are nowhere, still you are nowhere Nowhere in sight Come out to meet me, run out to meet me Come into the light Climb the boxcars to the engine Through the smoke and to the sky Your rails have always outrun mine, so I Picked them up and crashed them down In a moment close to now Cause I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss How you'd sigh yourself to sleep When I’d rake the springtime across your sheetsWoke a dog from a running dream And that's bad luck Ate a black fly in the cream And that's bad luck Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring And that's bad luck Could have stopped any one of these things But that would have been bad luck Are you tired of things going right Things going wrong Tired of trying to make everyone happy Too tired to sing your own songs Do you wish you could stop everything And take back your love Say you're sorry that you gave it up so easy And cry like you're trying to be born Woke a dog from a running dream And that's bad luck Ate a black fly in the cream And that's bad luck Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring And that's bad luck Could have stopped any one of these things But that would have been bad luckEarly in the mornin' where there used to be a slough There's a tiny business lake, don't let the cattails fool you Down in the bottom where nothing is born Sleeps a silver dollar with your face thereon Wish I could trace the frowning compass of your mouth Drop a Mercury dime down a Roman drain and summon Mars Last lion of Albion They'll use you for centuries to come They'll steal your patents for the sun And you'll feel extinction When you see your face on their money Late in the heavens that are already bought Sleeps a red planet in the galaxy of a lion's thoughts On the surface, every tendon and intended machine Is gonna buckle, knuckle, kneel on a carpet of lion's tongues Wish I could stand in the spray at the cliff of your sweet revenge Ocean of naked serrated marble crushing inHe led you to this hiding place His lightening threats spun silver tongues The red bells beckon you to ride A handprint on the driver's side It looks a lot like engine oil And tastes like being poor and small And popsicles in summer Deep red bells, deep as I have been done Deep red bells, deep as I have been done It always has to come this The red bells ring this tragic hour She lost sight of the overpass But daylight won't remember that When speckled fawns graze ‘round your bones’Who took the time to fold your clothes And shook the Valley of the Shadow Deep red bells, deep as I have been done Deep red bells, deep as I have been doneMy brain makes drugs to keep me slow A hilarious joke for some dead pharaoh But now, not even the masons know What drug will keep night from coming There are so many tools that are made for my hands But the tide smashes all my best-laid plans to sand And there's always someone to say it's easy for me But I revenge myself all over myself There's nothing you can say to me You never held it at the right angle You never held it at the right angle Catch a, catch a, catch a, catch a falling star But wash your hands of it Catch a, catch a, catch a, catch a falling star Because you can't hold it Did they poison my food  Is it cause I'm a girl If I puked up some sonnets, would you call me a miracle I'm gonna go where my urge leads no more Swallowed, waist-deep, in the gore of the forest Arboreal feast, let it finish me, please Cause I revenge myself all over myself There's nothing you can do to meSo the saying says, "an elephant never forgets"Standing in a concrete cave, swaying sad and insane They walked over the ocean in their dreams they dream awake Until the lights grew dim, until the cop cars came Everybody tells me, this is crazy, yes, I know it I'm a man-man-man, man-man-man-eater But still you're surprised-prised-prised when I eat ya You know they call them killer whales But you seem surprised when it pinned you down To the bottom of the tank, where you can't turn around It took half your leg and both your lungs When I craved I ate hearts of sharks, I know you know it I'm a man-man-man, man-man-man-eater But still you're surprised-prised-prised when I eat ya Yes, I'm a man-man-man, man-man, man-eater But still you're surprised-prised-prised when I eat ya It will end again in bullets fired It will end again in bullets fired
