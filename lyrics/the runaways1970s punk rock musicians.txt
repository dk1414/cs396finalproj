back to bein' straight I've seen the gutter view Is it day or night Porcupine kiss, novocaine lips Is it day or night White flowers weep In their warm, dust sleep And it's dog eat dog tonight Back door to insanity Was ripped from their throat Street wide hustlers and six string masters Look cold in their overcoats Is it day or night Porcupine kiss, novocaine lips Is it day or night White flowers weep In their warm, dust sleep And it's dog eat dog tonight, yeah, uhClean rock 'n' roll Makes the midnight flow tonight now It's hot tonight Come on let's have a good time In the dark of the night We hunt for fun Chasing after the moonlight Hiding from the sun American nights You kids are so strange American nights You're never gonna change Our magic is young Cause we just begun We light up the sky Always on the run We live in the streets In the alleys of screams Cause we're the queens of noise The answer to your dreams American nights You kids are so strange American nights You're never gonna changeWhen the moon is out, it starts to shine Thunder crashes, want to make you mine The sky lights up in my mind Fireworks between us you'll find And it's thunder The spell that I'm under It's thunder I see lightning crash And it's thunder Oh, how our love flashes It's thunder Don't need no other feelin'All the others, they're just the same But, oh, my baby, you're a hurricane Let me be your battered angel So you can be my tattered devil And it's thunder The spell that I'm under It's thunder I see lightning crash And it's thunder Oh, how our love flashes It's thunder Don't need no other feelin'I want somethin' bad and nice Hot love I want it nice from paradise Young love All night long I'm chasin' fast True love Make me scream, make it last We lovers never say goodbye We lovers never die We stop and go so quietly Cold lovers fade away I'm the one for you You know what I say is true I won't cry or tell you why I know that you love me too You do, a one, two, three, four Oh, yeah, come on now I want a kiss wet and real Strong love I wanna tell you how I feel Right now All night long it rained and rained My love Make me scream, "Hey, what's your name "With a pinch of rock and a dose of roll I can warm you up if you get too cold I can bring you up if you're going down I can smash your head all over this town You gave me the answer Now I got the answer, oh
