Used to spend my nights out in a barroom Liquor was the only love I'd known But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom And brought me back from bein' too far gone You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey You're as sweet as strawberry wine You're as warm as a glass of brandy And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time I've looked for love in all the same old places Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it'Cause there's nothin' like your love to get me high And you're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey You're as sweet as strawberry wine You're as warm as a glass of brandy And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the timeWell, the road rolls out like a welcome mat To a better place than the one we're at And I ain't got no kinda plan But I've had all of this town I can stand And I got friends out on the coast We can jump in the water and see what floats We've been savin' for a rainy day Let's beat the storm and be on our way And it don't matter to me Wherever we are is where I wanna be And, honey, for once in our life Let's take our chances and roll the dice I can be your lucky penny You can be my four-leaf clover Startin' over This might not be an easy time There's rivers to cross and hills to climb Some days, we might fall apart And some nights might feel cold and darkWe pass in the hall On our way to separate rooms The only time we ever talk Is when the monthly bills are due We go to work, we go to church We fake the perfect life I'm past the point of give a damn And all my tears are cried We can just go on like this Say the word, we'll call it quits Baby, you can go or you can stay But I won't love you either way It's been so long since I've felt Anything inside these walls You can't hate and you can't hurt When you don't feel at all I used to cry and stay up nights And wonder what went wrong And it's been hard But hearts can only do that for so longHoney, load up your questions And pick up your sticks and your stones And pretend I'm a shelter For heartaches that don't have a home And choose the words that cut like a razor And all that I'll say, is...Fire away Take your best shot Show me what you got Honey, I'm not afraid Rear back and take aim And fire away Well, I wish I could say That I've never been here before But you know and I know That I'll always come back for more Your love might be my damnation But I'll cry to my graveI'm feelin' like a bullet jumpin' out a gun I'm feelin' like a winner, I feel like the one You're doing somethin' to me, you're doing somethin' strange Well, jump back, talk to me, woman You make me wanna make a baby, baby, uh Supernatural woman, supernatural freak Don't know what you're doin', got me feelin' weak Oh, I wanna call you fever,

that used to fly They've all gone wherever they go Broken halos that used to shine Angels come down from the heavens Just to help us on our way Come to teach us, then they leave us And they find some other soul to save Seen my share of broken halos Folded wings that used to fly They've all gone wherever they go Broken halos that used to shine Broken halos that used to shine Don't go looking for the reasons Don't go asking Jesus why We're not meant to know the answers They belong to the by and by They belong to the by and byStreet lights along the highway Throwin' shadows in the dark And the memories keep on turnin'To the rhythm of a broken heart You only need a roof when it's rainin'You only need a fire when it's cold You only need a drink when the whiskey Is the only thing that you have left to hold Sun comes up and goes back down And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground Say the word and I'll be there for you Baby, I will be your parachute Parachute There's a song that I remember I never learned to play And a lifetime of forgotten words I never got to say You only need a roof when it's rainin'You only need a fire when it’s cold You only need a drink when the whiskey Is the only thing that you have left to hold Sun comes up and goes back down And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground Say the word and I’ll be there for you Baby, I will be your parachuteWhen I think of you and the first time we met And I heard the sound of your sweet gentle voice My heart took me over and gave me no choice And right then I knew It makes me want more of you Again and again I fall more in love with you Than I've ever been From the moment you wake me up'Til you kiss me goodnight Everything that you do It makes me want more of you When I look at you now that years have gone by I think of the memories that time can't erase And all of the smiles that you've brought to my face Your love's been so true It makes me want more of you Again and again I fall more in love with you Than I've ever been From the moment you wake me up'Til you kiss me goodnight Everything that you do It makes me want more of youGirl, the way you broke my heart It shattered like a rock through a window I thought we had it so good Never really saw this comin'Oh, why you got to be so cold Why you got to go and cut me like a knife And put our love on ice Oh, girl, you know you
