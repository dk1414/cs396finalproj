So close, no matter how far Couldn't be much more from the heart Forever trusting who we are And nothing else matters Never opened myself this way Life is ours, we live it our way All these words, I don't just say And nothing else matters Trust I seek and I find in you Every day for us something new Open mind for a different view And nothing else matters Never cared for what they do Never cared for what they know But I know So close, no matter how far It couldn't be much more from the heart Forever trusting who we are And nothing else mattersI can't remember anything Can't tell if this is true or a dream Deep down inside, I feel to scream This terrible silence stops me Now that the war is through with me I'm waking up, I cannot see That there's not much left of me Nothing is real but pain now Hold my breath as I wish for death Oh, please, God, wake me Back in the womb, it's much too real In pumps life that I must feel But can't look forward to reveal Look to the time when I'll live Fed through the tube that sticks in me Just like a wartime novelty Tied to machines that make me be Cut this life off from meSay your prayers, little one, don't forget, my son To include everyone I tuck you in, warm within, keep you free from sin'Til the Sandman, he comes Sleep with one eye open Gripping your pillow tight Exit light Enter night Take my hand We're off to never-never land Something's wrong, shut the light, heavy thoughts tonight And they aren't of Snow White Dreams of war, dreams of liars, dreams of dragons' fire And of things that will bite, yeah Sleep with one eye open Gripping your pillow tightEnd of passion play, crumbling away I'm your source of self-destruction Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear Leading on your death's construction Taste me, you will see More is all you need Dedicated to How I'm killing you Come crawling faster Obey your master Your life burns faster Obey your Master, master Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams Blinded by me, you can't see a thing Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream Master, master Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream Master, masterNew blood joins this Earth, and quickly he's subdued Through constant pained disgrace, the young boy learns their rules With time the child draws in, this whipping boy done wrong Deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and on, he's known Ooh, a vow unto his own that never from this day His will they'll take away, yeah What I've felt, what I've known Never shined through in what I've shown Never be, never see Won't see what might have been What I've felt, what I've known Never shined through in what I've shown Never free, never me So I dub thee "Unforgiven"They dedicate their lives to running all of his He tries to please them all, this bitter man he is Throughout his life the same, he's battled constantly This fight he cannot win, a tired man they see no longer cares The old man then prepares to die regretfully That old man here is me, yeahLife, it seems, will fade away Drifting further every day Getting lost within myself Nothing matters, no one else I have lost the will to live Simply nothing more to give There is nothing more for me Need the end to set me free Things not what they used to be Missing one inside of me Deathly lost, this can't be real Cannot stand this hell I feel Emptiness is filling me To the point of agony Growing darkness taking dawn I was me, but now he's gone No one but me can save myself, but it's too late Now I can't think, think why I should even try Yesterday seems as though it never existed Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye GoodbyeMake his fight, on the hill, in the early day Constant chill deep inside Shouting gun, on they run, through the endless grey On they fight, for their right, yes, but who's to say For a hill, men would kill â€” Why  They do not know Stiffened wounds test their pride Men of five, still alive, through the raging glow Gone insane from the pain that they surely know For whom the bell tolls Time marches on For whom the bell tolls Take a look to the sky just before you die It's the last time you will Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery Hears the silence so loud Crack of dawn, all is gone, except the will to be Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to seeSlaves, Hebrews born to serve To the Pharaoh Heed, to his every word Live in fear Faith, of the unknown

Hammer of justice crushes you, overpower The ultimate in vanity Exploiting their supremacy I can't believe the things you say I can't believe, I can't believe the price You pay Nothing can save you Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone Pulling your strings, justice is done Seeking no truth, winning is all Find it so grim, so true, so real Apathy their stepping stone, so unfeeling Hidden deep animosity, so deceiving Through your eyes their light burns, hoping to find Inquisition sinking you with prying minds
