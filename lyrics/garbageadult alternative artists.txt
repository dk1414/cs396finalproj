I'm only happy when it rains I'm only happy when it's complicated And though I know you can't appreciate it I'm only happy when it rains You know I love it when the news is bad And why it feels so good to feel so sad I'm only happy when it rains Pour your misery down Pour your misery down on me Pour your misery down Pour your misery down on me I'm only happy when it rains I feel good when things are going wrong I only listen to the sad, sad songs I'm only happy when it rains I only smile in the dark My only comfort is the night gone black I didn't accidentally tell you that I'm only happy when it rains You'll get the message by the time I'm through When I complain about me and you I'm only happy when it rainsYou pretend you're high Pretend you're bored Pretend you're anything Just to be adored And what you need Is what you get Don't believe in fear Don't believe in faith Don't believe in anything That you can't break You stupid girl You stupid girl All you had, you wasted All you had, you wasted What drives you on Can drive you mad A million lies to sell yourself Is all you ever hadShe gave you everything she had But she was young and dumb, she'd just turned 21 She didn't care to hang around So when the shit came down, why she was nowhere to be found This life can turn a good girl bad She was the sweetest thing that you had ever seen You're such a delicate boy In the hysterical realm Of an emotional landslide In physical terms With your cherry lips and golden curls You could make grown men gasp when you go walking past them In your hot pants and high heels They could not believe that such a body was for real It seemed like rainbows would appear Whenever you came near the clouds would disappear Because you looked just like a girl Your baby blues would flash and suddenly a spell was cast You're such a delicate boy In the hysterical realm Of an emotional landslide In physical termsI am milk I am red hot kitchen And I am cool Cool as the deep blue ocean I am lost So I am cruel But I'd be love and sweetness If I had you I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you I am weak But I am strong I can use my tears to Bring you home I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you I'm waiting, I'm waiting for youYou can look, but you can't touch I don't think I like you much Heaven knows what a girl can do Heaven knows what you've got to prove I think I'm paranoid And complicated I think I'm paranoid Manipulate it Bend me, break me Anyway you need me All I want is you Bend me, break me Breaking down is easy All I want is you I fall down just to give you a thrill Prop me up with another pill If I should fail, if I should fold I nailed my faith to the sticking poleI'm only happy when it rains I'm only happy when it's complicated And though I know you can't appreciate it I'm only happy when it rains You know I love it when the news is bad And why it feels so good to feel so sad I'm only happy when it rains Pour your misery down Pour your misery down on me Pour your misery down Pour your misery down on me I'm only happy when it rains I feel good when things are going wrong I only listen to the
