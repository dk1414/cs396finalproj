Words have never seemed adept To quantify a moment’s depth I’m living in a distant past Those days are never coming back You’re burrowed like a shard of glass It’s bigger than a heart attack I’m waiting on the storm to pass Those days are never coming back Kissing you once more Could not erase the time Wishing it was the Same as it ever was Missing you once more But you were never mine Reminisce it all What’s done can never be undone Images of you Dripping down my skull Slowly Part and parcel to a night like this Adorned in marks consistent with the kiss A spectre walks these halls Tracing pictures with its calls On the shore of an ocean Running raw beneath its wave Pulled out by the currents Towards a heavenly place I see it when I sleep I wake up and I weepStay for a moment I'm asking, I'm begging I wish you would stay for awhile Give me a moment You ask me, you beg me I'll trade you an inch for a mile No, I'm not perfect but I'll try To be better, be better And we are changing, oh, but I still Remember, remember I know that you used to love me You used to love me I know that you used to want me Used to need me I know that you used to hold me You used to like me I know that you usеd to love me Tell mе you love me, oh In my own interest I want that stone roses Be thrown to my feet in a pile I know I'm beguiling I buy my own flowers Just throw me a bone once in a while Oh, I could do this for a time But I'm asking, I'm begging for Some reassurance that you Still love me, and do you love me Wasting my time Does it matter  It matters I'm oh so benign Does it matter  It matters I want to be free Does it matter  It matters Walking the line Does it matter  It matters to me Frozen in ice Mental stasis erases Stuck with this vice I am naked, I'm vacant And hopelessly caught In the riptide of this life Would be so nice Just to know what tomorrow will bring Even on the inside, uh I'm bracing for impact, uh I'm waiting for the answers, uh So let them come, uhLa-doo, la-doo La-doo, la-doo Oh, wasting time has become a love affair I'm patient poignantly Grace this time when our God was never there I begged Her for relief Oh, how You're too good to me I'm unwell You're too cruel to be Wasting time Can I get saved for the summer Acquiescing signs Nothing lasts forever La-doo, la-doo La-doo, la-dooYou'd be hard pressed to find someone left Who not mistaken for another Would not guess that sign someone left Who so left first to be uncovered Like I am ambivalence the rock on which to stand While there's a consonance evaporating Resigned to reverence, my present and my past A love forevermore, to excavate meI'm caught in a moment I know all too well It looks just like heaven, it burns just like hell A most vicious cycle, I'm under her spell I'm caught in the riptide, I know this too well Yeah, once I was high, how quickly I fell I'm ever heaving, never held Oh, there was a time when I knew for sure But I don't remember who I am anymore In the riptide I am caught between the memories of suffering And the pain that finds me now On the inside, I am flayed beneath the promise of tranquility But the current drags me down And as I prepare to drown Through the water, shines the sun And then the salt, it stings my tender flesh I resign to my own impotence I am helpless and I blow a gentle kiss To the ebony abyssLight breaks in through the window pane It creeps in soft a mild I watch it spill cross the bedroom floor And it's day again and it's day again I want for this to be free of pain Illusions soft and mild It glows in me, and I'm free once more Then it rains again, then it rains again Why do I drip slowly backwards Just before I flow Crystallize this glowing phantom Just before I go Into endless night again No comfort ever holds A reverie of a better world I'm alive again, I'm alive again Why do I drip slowly backwards Just before I flow Crystallize this glowing phantom Just before I goEven though the past is gone It never dies, it's never done I’m breathing in any light that shines above Deep inside are razor burns And though I've tried, they really hurt Even so, I am braced in false aplomb A shroud of indecision I am mired in perdition Watching life go by A disappeared volition But reverie exists in Sanguine lullabye J'mabondone a Élan Vital Even in my darkest hour My temperament is sweet and sour In tepid hope for a grace that nеver comes Can’t deny my wrеtched birth It is, at best, tumultuous A requiem for what never wasHow the days have gone thus far Wouldn't care to tell no one Waiting on a world of stars But it wouldn't come, it wouldn't come That's winter Slowly, slowly, slowly Spring save me What is it about the cold that makes me sad That's winter Slowly, slowly, slowly Spring save me What is it about the cold that makes me sad When the days are cold and harsh Oh, even waking up is hard And I'm saving up for what Oh, what is it about the cold Should have fought the terror hard Oh should have known you'd fall this far And you need a moment's pause But you wouldn't stop, you wouldn't stopLasting somewhere Are the wasted ones Somehow, somewhere All I want is for…It doesn't matter anyway No, it doesn't matter anyway No, it doesn't matter anyway No, it doesn't matter anyway Somehow, somewhere All I want is for Your hand in my hair We're the wasted ones It doesn't matter anyway No, it doesn't matter anyway No, it doesn't matter anyway When the tides turn elsewhere I shall give myself To that moment, somewhere I am ever crashing Just waiting for you to pull me out
