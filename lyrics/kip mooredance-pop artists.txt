my heart Thank you mama for the roll and Thank you daddy for the rock Most of all, most of all Thanks to the bulls that bucked me off, woo Aw hell what if I turn the rhymes up in my mind into a hit

I ain't gonna lie If you want to known the truth, how I feel about you tonight If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya If you were my last night I ever had on wheels, I woulda drive you like I stole ya If you were my last shot, last shot of whiskey I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip Swirl you around and around and around Then I'd shoot ya down So baby let me look at you and see just what I got If you were my cherry stem I'd tie you in a knot And if I could inhale you, oh baby I'd be gone I'd be floating round high as the Colorado sky blowing smoke rings all night long If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya If you were my last night I ever had on wheels, I woulda drive you like I stole ya If you were my last shot, last shot of whiskey I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip Swirl you around and around and around Then I'd shoot ya downMe and Teddy used to burn that old Chevy All the way up to Mary Lee's One of the guy's kinda ride or die And we were thick as thieves The whole damn town said when we come around We're as mean as a four letter word Up to no good, no we didn't have much Just a whole lotta time to burn So if we got high, we got stoned If there was a fight, we got it on If there was a backseat, we made love That was then and that was us We crossed the county line for a kegger one night There were some girls we had never seen Teddy had his eye locked on a dime Mary said she was lookin' at me Standin' there sippin' on smoke And a cheap ass bottle of wine She said "My name's Kate, you're my kinda crazy And it takes one to know one"
