Placed behind door number 3 I lay shaking, will he pick me Don't be alarmed or misinterpret For it's his anonymity that put me here I should decide whether it's The dopamine or someone hitting "refresh" on my Spinal Chord is aching as if the earth Like me Been shaking, shaken up Door number 3 has opened up And like that, the world pounces on the knobs of one and two"If we can't have it all, then why have anything at all "They chant Their song sending shivers up and down, around my Spinal Chord is aching as if the earth Like me Been shaking, shaken Up and Into the place we know will give the Verdict Then finding that there's something in the Something in the Something in the waterJust shut up and swallow before your last breath You'll say what's to be said Well my last breath breathed, leaked last night As he melted into walls That spoke like the sun to the last man and woman on the earth"We will both die nice and warm"Warm is what it is to see His insides on the floor Of an abandoned auditorium Singing in polyphony"Just shut up and swallow" is what the kid meant When he complained about all of it The ease of an important procedure and how everyone everywhere was always, mostly often laying down on him Meeting, crushing, killing him But I bought none of it  This is not universal Kid is not he who abandoned that auditorium and no, I do not want to become him anymore, but yes, I do want him to become what I believe he once was, my best friend, and stop that, he still is I don't really think about it that way, no, I don't really ever think about it that way"Is your brain big enough to get your feelings hurt  Me neither"Me neither You're not listening, I said "stop!"Because it's come to be too much I can't just pile aesthetic-perceptive dilemma Over-analytic demeanors, feelings of lonely worthlessness And unproductivity atop the other Allowing each to bleed through their fabricated boundaries And become one more thing to...Notice me Before it's too late and too far away From when I dreamt of explaining to you That you are an everywhere That caused these words I'd somehow type My fingers, feet and diaphragm All screaming And as things grew more complicated Conscious expansion cultivated The books' ideas, songs' polyphony Texture, content danced around me And unlike all the events staged The puppeteered facade I'd made This was naturally extraordinary And grabbed me from the ordinary Now perceived reduction theory Of where we areNight slows me down and puts me off Totter-scatter-blabbering Sort of funny that you would make a Stop-action short Because I sort of Pretend that I'm next to your progressing form As you move from shot to shot I mean, I'm next to you on the streets Of a city that I never really thought I'd move in to That I never even really saw myself moving in But now, I'm in the way of this other me That's just trying to say"Sort of funny that you're moving on along These streets you happen to now live on!"It's these ideas that waste all my time!It's these ideas that waste all my time!It's these ideas that waste all my time!It's these ideas that waste all my time!Okay, okay, okay, so honesty didn't do anything For me once again But it did the night that I said to Rob That I could not keep my opinions to myself for any longer But that could've just been another one of my Another one of my Blah blah blahs Hat of greens shows symmetry In front of hat, alone, sits me Fourth day I don't want it anyway To be reliving It won't be that bad again because It can't amount in comparison Thirty minutes of make-up For all to see but you Are not what I want you to be Universal there At three A M on the first of a year When it started, I'm not sure In a jumper, with a bracelet In a jumper, with a bracelet On your right wrist That turns with a golden knob Opening amidst a dense yellow light, fade To reveal an infinite skyEvery time I cry about your transience I replace you with the thought of The growing moon as I climb towards it Tell myself "It's not too late"And rest assured that I won't ever have to care About anyone, because it's too late And with you it, it gets harder to realize It gets harder Do you ever think about  You promised I wanna die when you're not here Cause I'm convinced everyone else Thinks that I'm a dick My ideals fog up my windshield And I crash into the houses They depict in their In their songs I want to be a part of you again Face the crowds and turn back again Rediscover why we're turning Back away From a town you say has lost all of it's meaning In a way I can't see the town, I only see frustration And see a landscape, a blank, raw canvasTake it back, take it back, oh please God take it back Before the puddles turn to pools and the pools, a sea engulfing souls With every single drop comes three more burdens You say it's distant, I say it's distant Your hand approaches and as always it is wrapped in yarn Reminding me of weekends past when Abby sang along Ken, you've got it all wrong, this is big, this is real like a clocktower's minute only put behind the wheel Let the pedals push themselves, I'll let these pedals push themselves I could've kissed her on a bed not parallel to But perpendicular to everything you've taught me All these thoughts unsound and the ideas of infinity If this is all never-ending then why am I ending Born again, reminded That there's the earth Doorway scene makes time for peace In nearby ravine Wake up dead, the pine trees sing Leave home Can't, can't hear the sound made by the yarn Can't hear the blood flow through your arm Can't hear anything at all It seems these anythings are all The kind that believe reflections aren't the mobile ones That win, win, win, they win, win, win and run How they run away for it isThis is my resignation from the S-C-E-N-E Hating M TV is getting old I said "no" once, got stabbed in the back While they said "relax"In Sweden, they got it right, I guess But where does that leave me, leaving Always leaving, never staying Good thing my feet are still intact It's just my hands that are killing me Killing someone else may make for better poetry At least that's what they said But at this moment, clarity's appeared And I am gone, off to what I've found more in The fact I hate the way I talk Cynics mock all surroundings I just wish to live with the ones that Instead of hating M TV Beat on the floorboards to wake their tenants That they know are not asleep The way we're sure they're not asleep We woke up in the same bed This whole imaginary underground Has got me thinking, got me dreaming And if we're all our own co-pilots In our cockpits made of tin And then we fall down hills of pavement It's time I grew and said to them"It's not what you think it is"We analyze the states we're in Why is it that when we sneeze There's a chance we'll die Alone, alone, alone, alone Alone, alone Alone, that's what I hope I'll want to be When all acquaintance leaves me Because if I don't, who knows, I might just see That no one needs me seeingScared, I destroy all the phones Somewhere on the other lines lies a girl biting her lip Shut the door, we're in her warmth Mother Earth has something up her sleeve I want to see you before I tell mom and dad how much I see in this All of a sudden Suddenly All of a sudden--ly Wires and plastic Rose through the air to greet me I will sleep on a floor tonight I will admit I was fine with the assist yet exploitation multiplied and grew and lastly grew again Only to come through the window in the form of a map of the stars In which you'd use to plan the route he'd take to travel back towards you It was the gratitude in the air that night that separated every boy from all the men My proposition: reverse the order Let me come to your window in the form of a map of the stars I know I'm not the only one That takes the ground that he steps upon And throws it to the sky In an attempt to answer all the I wonder why's The skull is what's inside The brain matter, it spews tonight I want to feel you breatheI'm on the phone while I'm driving Take my hand off of these wheels To keep my legs from shaking Moving to the crashing of cymbals Growing into themes, near to mesmerize But never right on time You say that you mean it this time more Last time turned to nothing, this I'm sure But I've been wrong before And how this feels, and how Liz sings"I won't decorate my love"Has got me thinking, it's got me dreaming Of imaginary times, on an imaginary couch Listening to imaginary records, and with imaginary mouths Saying "boy, this is it, this must be it"Please, can't this be it
