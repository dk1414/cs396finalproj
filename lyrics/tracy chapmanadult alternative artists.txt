that's what I didDon't ya know They're talking about a revolution It sounds like a whisper Don't ya know They're talking about a revolution It sounds like a whisper While they're standing in the welfare lines Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation Wasting time in the unemployment lines Sittin' around waitin' for a promotion Don't ya know They're talking about a revolution It sounds like a whisper Poor people gonna rise up And get their share Poor people gonna rise up And take what's theirs Don't ya know you better run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run

They might take away my life I just want someone to hold me Oh, and rock me through the nightIf you wait for me Then I'll come for you Although I've traveled far I always hold a place for you in my heart If you think of me If you miss me once in awhile Then I'll return to you I'll return and fill that space in your heart Remembering Your touch Your kiss Your warm embrace I'll find my way back to you If you'll be waiting If you dream of me Like I dream of you In a place that's warm and dark In a place where I can feel the beating of your heartLast night I heard the screaming Loud voices behind the wall Another sleepless night for me It won't do no good to call The police Always come late, if they come at all Last night I heard the screaming Loud voices behind the wall Another sleepless night for me It won't do no good to call The police Always come late, if they come at all And when they arrive They say they can't interfere With domestic affairs Between a man and his wife And as they walk out the door The tears well up in her eyes Last night I heard the screaming Then a silence that chilled my soul Prayed that I was dreaming When I saw the ambulance in the roadAll you folks think you own my life But you never made any sacrifice Demons they are on my trail I'm standing at the crossroads of the hell I look to the left I look to the right There're hands that grab me on every side Mmmmmmmmm Mmh, mmh, mmmh, mmmh Mmmmmmmmm Mmh, mmh, mmmh, mmmh All you folks think I got my price At which I'll sell all that is mine You think money rules when all else fails Go sell your soul and keep your shell I'm trying to protect what I keep inside All the reasons why I live my life Mmmmmmmmm Mmh, mmh, mmmh, mmmh Mmmmmmmmm Mmh, mmh, mmmh, mmmhTwo weeks in a Virginia jail For my lover, for my lover Twenty thousand dollar bail For my lover for my lover And everybody thinks that I'm the fool But they don't get any love from you The things we won't do for love Climb a mountain if I had to Risk my life so I could have you You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you Everyday I'm psychoanalyzed For my lover, for my lover They dope me up, and I tell them lies For my lover, for my lover And everybody thinks that I'm the fool But they don't get any love from you The things we won't do for love Climb a mountain if I had to Risk my life so I could have you You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, youAcross the lines Who would dare to go Under the bridge Over the tracks That separates whites from blacks Choose sides Run for your lives Tonight the riots begin On the back
