And so I landed here on another planet By now it seems like it might have happened to me Everybody here looking at me weird So I wondered And so I wondered and wandered around the planet Looking for something that might have mattered to me Everything here looks to me to be All in order All in order it seems to be'Til cautiously I go Around the corner, where nothing will grow without a Kind of water that they don't know about The plants think the animals are ruining everything Everything here looks to me to be All in order All in order it seems to be'Til cautiously I goNow you think that you could be The something that I could see So why don't you just look at me And tell me that you're going free All I said that you would find Is what it is that's on your mind You will crack, and very soon Your guitar will slip out of tune Now you've found out at long last That things are going way too fast In my case, well, I guess that's tough'Cause things aren't going fast enough Chips are down, speaking, choking Die's too hot, the mold is broken What it is, what I said Was left better unspoken Speed is not at my command When you're knocked down, you will not stand My fortune's told, and it's been cast And you'll be left in the pastAfter all the troubles have come and gone They were here for so long Now I've got this sinking feeling Everyone seems to be leaving Oh-woah-oh And I can't believe how lonely it is here on K Street There's no one like me here on K Street How lonely it is here on K Street today, today, today I thought that all the problems had gone away I found out where I should be They were back the very next day And I don't know what to believe Oh-woah-oh And I can't believe how lonely it is here on K Street There's no one like me here on K Street How lonely it is here on K Street today, today, today Today, today, today, today TodaySomeday, when one guy in the world finally owns every coin And when I'm sure that he's not thinking of me When he says, "Hi there, I really am your friend Sorry, I'm doing all I can for you And I really mean that"Nobody ever asked me what I wanted from them, and then Listened to me say, they only ask me again That's about the time I'll be going to the moon And then that's where I'll stay That's about the time I'll be going to the moon And then that's where I'll stay Far away from here Someday, when I can't take this place I'll take a trip out into space I think I mean it That's about the time I'll be going to the moon And then that's where I'll stay That's about the time I'll be going to the moon And then that's where I'll stay Far away from hereI've been lied to, led around and then cut down Been spit on and walked upon by you I've been run through slapped till sober Then driven over held at bay then thrown away by you But not anymore Never again Never again by you I need some help beside me Got to throw the past behind me Now more than yesterday The truth must come alive I feel more than half dead The gun lies there beside my bed You don't forget a thing I said to you I been sick all day Yesterday and everyday I'm sick of all that has to with youWalk around sometime and see if you can think up something That you've never thought before Judging by the looks of things, it's getting late And you've gone by that neighborhood before Prove it to yourself if you've got something to offer See if you can welcome yourself home anymore If you ever have, then it's not worth mentioning Believe me never Hate me forever Believe me never Hate me the rest of your life Believe me never Hate me forever Believe me never Hate me foreverThey don't really care for you They don't wanna know what you're going through They will never do anything for you They don't move an inch, they don't have to I'll try anything I can do I will walk as far as I have to Walk around the world if I have to prove This world isn't here for me and you They don't really care for you They don't wanna know what you're going through They will never do anything for you They don't move an inch, they don't have to I'll do anything I can Storm across their patriotic land Scraping flag decals off of custom vans Yellow ribbons 'round the garbage cans You'll find anything you want If you look for it long enough Everything you need, you'll have But you will look longI know that life gets so miserable It isn't fair, and it doesn't care Nothing goes the way you want it to Nothing new, and nothing else to do now And when you've had enough Ahh-ah-ahh You can call me up Ahh-ahh Have you had enough Ahh-ah-ahh You can call me up Ahh-ahh Precious life, so miserable Wasting time and being tired We're also tired of being tired of Wasting time, this precious time And when you've had enough Ahh-ah-ahh You can call me up Ahh-ahh Have you had enough Ahh-ah-ahh You can call me up Ahh-ahhLately been thinking 'bout what What it means to be in a country that's not all that it should be I don't know if I'm all ready to leave Do you really want to be in America See, you don't really have to be in America Somewhere else might be better I'm not just talking about weather But I don't think that I'd be willing to get up and go You've got the answer Speak up if you know Maybe it's just that I know what it means to me To be living a life almost thinking free I can pretty well choose how I want to be Do you really want to be in America See, you don't really have to be in America Somewhere else might be better I'm not just talking about weather But I don't think that I'd be willing to get up and go You've got the answer Speak up if you knowThe day that did not exist I sat all alone That date did not exist In my mind the storm That beat the shore The day that did not exist I was never warned The date did not exist There was no one home There was nothing wrong There was nothing done The day that did not exist I was not alone The date did not exist I unplugged the phone And rode out the storm
