There is a house in New Orleans They call the rising sun And it's been the ruin of many a poor Boy And God I know I'm one My mother was a tailor Sewed my new blue jeans My father was a gamblin' man Down in New Orleans Now the only thing a gambler needs is A suitcase and a trunk And the only time he'll be satisfied Is when he's on a drunk Oh mother, tell your children Not to do what I have done Spend your lives in sin and misery In the house of the Rising Sun Well I've got one foot on the platform The other foot on the train I'm going back to New Orleans To wear that ball and chain Well there is a house in New Orleans They call the Rising Sun And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy And God, I know, I'm oneI've got a feeling today The bad times are on their way I saw it all in a dream last night And I can’t get it out of my mind Well evil is near And the feeling is very clear They take my heart and they take my soul Black walls of night I couldn't face the light All hope was gone Evil came along I got a spell on me Evil hex on me Bad luck and bad signs A black cat crossed my path Well evil is near And the feeling is very clear They take my heart and they take my soul Black walls of night I couldn't face the light All hope was gone Evil came alongWaking this morning I knew the time had come There'd be no dawning and yes there'd be no sun The dark clouds forming I knew it had begun Now rain is falling the enemy has won And soon the warning came evacuate your homes No time to waste don't hesitate or you'll be all alone And then the soldiers came they're fighting yes to die But one just had to ask how can you kill the sky Oh Lord Oh Lord Oh Lord what have we done First we killed the sea, and now we've killed the sun Oh Lord Oh Lord Oh Lord look what we've done Yes we've killed our planet no hope for anyone Screams and cries from everywhere I had to block my ears People begging for the sun to warm them and to dry their tears I find myself got full of breath the end now soon and death I had to turn my head away cause no-one else was left Oh Lord God what have we done Oh Lord above Lord what have we done Oh Lord Oh Lord Oh Lord what have we done First we killed the sea, and now we've killed the sun Oh Lord Oh Lord Oh Lord look what we've done Yes we've killed our planet no hope for anyoneThere is a house in New Orleans They call the rising sun And
