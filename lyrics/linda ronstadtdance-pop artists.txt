I feel so bad, I got a worried mind I'm so lonesome all the time Since I left my baby behind On Blue Bayou Saving nickels, saving dimes Working 'til the sun don't shine Looking forward to happier times On Blue Bayou I'm going back someday Come what may to Blue Bayou Where the folks are fun And the world is mine on Blue Bayou Where those fishing boats with their sails afloat If I could only see That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes How happy I'd be Gonna see my baby again Gonna be with some of my friends Maybe I'll feel better again On Blue BayouFeeling better now that we're through Feeling better 'cause I'm over you I learned my lesson, it left a scar Now I see how you really are You're no good, you're no good, you're no good Baby, you're no good I'm gonna say it again You're no good, you're no good, you're no good Baby, you're no good I broke a heart that's gentle and true Well, I broke a heart over someone like you I'll beg his forgiveness on bended knee I wouldn't blame him if he said to me You're no good, you're no good, you're no good Baby, you're no good I'm gonna say it again You're no good, you're no good, you're no good Baby, you're no goodSomewhere out there Beneath the pale moonlight Someone's thinking of me And loving me tonight Somewhere out there Someone's saying a prayer That we'll find one another In that big somewhere out there And even though I know how very far apart we are It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky Somewhere out there If love can see us through Then we'll be together Somewhere out there Out where dreams come trueI been warped by the rain, driven by the snow I'm drunk and dirty, don't you know, but I'm still willin'Out on the road late last night I'd see my pretty Alice in every headlight, Alice, Dallas Alice And I've been from Tucson to Tucumcari, Tehachapi to Tonopah Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made Driven the backroads so I wouldn't get weighed And if you give me weed, whites and wine And you show me a sign And I'll be willin' to be movin'And I've been kicked by the wind, robbed by the sleet Had my head stove in, but I'm still on my feet and I'm still willin'And I smuggled some smokes and folks from Mexico Baked by the sun every time I go to Mexico, ah, but I'm still And I've been from Tucson to Tucumcari, Tehachapi to Tonopah Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made Driven the backroads so I wouldn't get weighed And if you give me weed, whites and wine And you show me a sign And I'll be willin' to be movin'Love will abide Take things in stride Sounds like good advice But there's no one at my side And time washes clean Love's wounds unseen That's what someone told me But I don't know what it means'Cause I've done everything I know To try and make you mine And I think I'm gonna love you For a long, long time Caught in my fears Blinking back the tears I can't say you hurt me When you never let me near And I never drew One response from you All the while you fell All over girls you never knewPeople try to rape me Always think I'm crazy Make me burn the candle right down Baby I can't stay I don't need your jewels in my frown Now all you women are low-down gamblers Cheating like I don't know how Baby I go crazy There's fever in the funkhouse now Well this low-down bitching Got my poor feet a-itching Can't you see the deuce is still wild Baby get it straight You got to roll me And call me the tumbling dice Always in a hurry Never stop to worry Can't see the time passing by Honey got no money I'm sixes and sevens and nines Well hey now baby I'm the rank outsider You can be my partner in crime Baby get it straight You got to roll me Call me the tumbling diceI've been cheated Been mistreated When will I be loved I've been put down I've been pushed 'round When will I be loved When I find a new man That I want for mine He always breaks my heart in two It happens every time I've been made blue I've been lied to When will I be loved When I find a new man That I want for mine He always breaks my heart in two It happens every timeThey say that love's a gentle thing But it's only brought me pain For the only man I ever loved Has gone on the mornin' train I never will marry I'll be no man's wife I expect to live single All the days of my life Well, the train pulled out, the whistle blew With a long and a lonesome moan He's gone, he's gone like the mornin' dew And left me all alone I never will marry I'll be no man's wife I expect to live single All the days of my life Well, there's many a change in the winter wind And a change in the cloud's design There's many a change in a young man's heart But never a change in mineSome say the heart is just like a wheel When you bend it, you can't mend it But my love for you is like a sinking ship And my heart is on that ship out in mid-ocean When harm is done, no love can be won I know it happens frequently What I can't understand, oh please, God, hold my hand Why it had to happen to me And it's only love And it's only love That can wreck a human being And turn him inside-out Some say the heart is just like a wheel When you bend it, you can't mend it But my love for you is like a sinking ship And my heart is on that ship out in mid-oceanI feel so bad, I got a worried mind I'm so lonesome all the time Since I left my baby behind On Blue Bayou Saving nickels, saving dimes Working 'til the sun don't shine Looking forward to happier times On Blue Bayou I'm going back someday Come what may to Blue Bayou Where the folks are fun And the world is mine on Blue Bayou Where those fishing boats with their sails afloat If I could only see That
