The best thing 'bout tonight's that we're not fighting Could it be that we have been this way before I know you don't think that I am trying I know you're wearing thin down to the core But hold your breath Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again Don't make me change my mind Or I won't live to see another day, I swear it's true Because a girl like you is impossible to find You're impossible to find This is not what I intended I always swore to you I'd never fall apart You always thought that I was stronger I may have failed, but I have loved you from the start Oh, but hold your breath Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again Don't make me change my mind Or I won't live to see another day, I swear it's true Because a girl like you is impossible to find It's impossible…With every appearance by you Blinding my eyes I can hardly remember The last time I felt like I do You're an angel disguised And you're lying real still But your heartbeat is fast just like mine And the movie's long over That's three that have passed, one more's fine Will you stay awake for me I don't wanna miss anything I don't wanna miss anything I will share the air I breath I'll give you my heart on a string I just don't wanna miss anything Im trying real hard not to shake Im biting my tongue But im feeling alive And with every breath that I take I feel like I've won You're my key to survivalShare with me the blankets that you're wrapped in Because it's cold outside ,  it's cold outside Share with me the secrets that you kept in Because it's cold inside , it's cold inside And your slow shaking finger tips show That you're scared like me so Let's pretend we're alone And I know you may be scared And I know we're unprepared But I don't care Tell me, tell me What makes you think that you are invincible I can see it in your eyes that you're so sure Please don't tell me that I'm the only one that's vulnerable Impossible I was born to tell you I love you Isn't that a song already I get a B in originality And it's true I can't go on without you Your smile makes me see clearer If you could only see in the mirror what I seeWaiting for your, call I'm sick, call I'm angry Call I'm desperate for your voice Listening to the song we used to sing In the car, do you remember Butterfly, early Summer It's playing on repeat Just like when we would meet Like when we would meet I was born to tell you, "I love you"And I am torn to do what I have to To make you mine Stay with me tonight Stripped and polished, I am new, I am fresh I am feeling so ambitious, you and me, flesh to flesh'Cause every breath that you will take When you are sitting next to me Will bring life into my deepest hopes, what's your fantasy What's your, what's your I was born to tell you, "I love you"And I am torn to do what I have to To make you mine Stay with me tonightDidn't you want to hear the sound of all the places we could go Do you fear the expressions on the faces we don't know It's a cold hard road when you wake up And I don't think that I have the strength To let you go Maybe it's just me, couldn't you believe That everything I said and did, wasn't just deceiving And the tear in your eye, and your calm hard face Makes me wish that I was never brought into this place There goes my ring, it might as well have been shattered And I'm here to sing about the things that mattered About the things that made us feel alive for oh, so long About the things that kept you on my side When I was wrong Maybe it's just me, couldn't you believe That everything I said and did, wasn't just deceiving And the tear in your eye, and your calm hard face Makes me wish that I was never brought into this placeTurn around Turn around and fix your eye in my direction So there is a connection I can't speak I can't make a sound to somehow capture your attention I'm staring at perfection Take a look at me so you can see How beautiful you are You call me a stranger You say I'm a danger But all these thoughts are leaving you tonight I'm broke and abandoned You are an angel Making all my dreams come true tonight I'm confident But I can't pretend I wasn't terrified to meet you I knew you could see right through me I saw my life flash right before my very eyes And I knew just what we'd turn into I was hoping that you could see Take a look at me so you can see How beautiful you are You call me a stranger You say I'm a danger But all these thoughts are leaving you tonight I'm broke and abandoned You are an angel Making all my dreams come true tonight You are an angel Making all my dreams come true tonightIt's a shame that it had to be this way It's not enough to say I'm sorry It's not enough to say I'm sorry Maybe I'm to blame Or maybe we're the same But either way I can't breathe Either way I can't breathe All I had to say is goodbye We're better off this way We're better off this way I'm alive but I'm losing all my drive Cause everything we've been through And everything about you Seemed to be a lie A guiltless twisted lie It made me learn to hate you Or hate myself for letting it pass by All I had to say is goodbye We're better off this way We're better off this way All I had to say is goodbye We're better off this way We're better off this wayI dream a lot, I know you say"I've got to get away The world is not yours for the taking"Is all you ever say I know I'm not the best for you But promise that you'll stay'Cause if I watch you go You'll see me wasting You'll see me wasting away'Cause today, you walked out of my life'Cause today, your words felt like a knife I'm not living this life Goodbyes are meant for lonely people Standing in the rain And no matter where I go It's always pouring all the same These streets are filled with memories Both perfect and in pain And all I wanna do is love you But I'm the only one to blame"Heart Stops "Featuring Veronica Ballestrini It seems just like yesterday You were begging me to stay I thought I knew what I wanted Should have known it was you Life’s been pretty good these days I’ve learned to live with your mistakes I always knew what I wanted All I wanted was you It’s good to hear your voice And by the way I can’t get you out of my head Still sleeping on my side of this bed I can’t shake this feeling It won’t stop till my heart stops beating The fall came way too fast this year And it’s way too cold without you here I wish you knew what you wanted When you didn’t want me I’ve been on the road for the past two months Thinking about you just a little too much Now I know what I want And all I want is youSpeak with your tongue tied I know that you're tired but I just want to know Where you want to go I may be sad but I'm not weak This situation is bleak and your puffy eyes never lie Your tears come from inside Until Sunday I'll be waiting for an answer I guess that yesterday's not good enough for you You know that I hate this song You know that I hate this song Because it was written for you Drown your fears with me I'm feeling real sorry, your glossy eyes don't need the sadness they have seen But you're way too deep to swim back up again But somehow I can't find the moment you said goodbye Until Sunday I'll be waiting for an answer I guess that yesterday's not good enough for you You know that I hate this song You know that I hate this song Because it was written for you
