Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep Dreamin' about the things that we could be But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard Said no more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars Yeah, we'll be countin' stars I see this life, like a swinging vine Swing my heart across the line And in my face is flashing signs Seek it out and ye' shall find Old, but I'm not that old Young, but I'm not that bold And I don't think the world is sold On just doing what we're told I feel something so right doin' the wrong thing I feel something so wrong doin' the right thing I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie Everything that kills me makes me feel alive Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep Dreamin' about the things that we could be But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard Said no more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep Dreamin' about the things that we could be But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard Said no more countin' dollars, we'll be, we'll be countin' starsI need another story Something to get off my chest My life gets kinda boring Need something that I can confess'Til all my sleeves are stained red From all the truth that I've said Come by it honestly I swear Thought you saw me wink, no I've been on the brink, so So tell me what you want to hear Something that will light those ears I'm sick of all the insincere So I'm gonna give all my secrets away This time Don't need another perfect lie Don't care if critics ever jump in line I'm gonna give all my secrets away My God, amazing how we got this far It's like we're chasing all those stars Who's driving shiny big black cars And every day I see the news All the problems that we could solve And when a situation rises Just write it into an album Send it straight to gold But I don't really like my flow, noDays when We'd fight, we'd fight 'til I would give in Yeah, perfect disasters We were reaching, reaching for the rafters And on most of the days we were searching for ways To get up and get out of the town that we were raised, yeah, Cause we were done I remember, we were sleeping in cars We were searching for O ZWe were burning cigars With white plastics tips 'til we saw the sun And we said crazy things like I refuse to look back thinking days were better Just because they're younger days I don't know what's 'round the corner Way I feel right now I swear we'll never change Back when we were kids Swore we would never die You and me were kids Swear that we’ll never die Lights down And we drive and we're drivin' just to get out Yeah, perfect disasters Yeah we were swinging, swinging from the raftersI'm holding on your rope Got me ten feet off the ground And I'm hearing what you say But I just can't make a sound You tell me that you need me Then you go and cut me down, but wait You tell me that you're sorry Didn't think I'd turn around, and say that It's too late to apologize It's too late I said it's too late to apologize It's too late Too late, oh-oh I'd take another chance Take a fall, take a shot for you, oh-whoa I need you like a heart needs a beat But it's nothing new, yeah, yeah I loved you with a fire red Now it's turning blue, and you say Sorry like the angel Heaven let me think was you, but I'm afraidCan't I just turn back the clock Forgive my sins I just wanna roll my sleeves up And start again I know that I messed it up Time and time again I just wanna roll my sleeves up And start again I was switchin' up the lanes Steppin' out the frame I'm in I was pulling on the reins Sick of all the same happenin'I swear I was looking for disaster Mixed with a bottle of gin And just because I come home after Doesn't mean you'll take me in You see my world is spinning like there's nothing below You see my world is feeling like it just might explode And yes I know it's hard to take it backwards from my mind I need to get it right, need to see some light come inI remember talking and drinking what we could find Burnin' all those candles and stayin' up through the night We'd make reservations for the places we know we'd never try But then oh, we found some rich love I remember feeling broke as a bottle of wine I didn't move to the city to count all my pennies And worship the Hollywood sign She'll say, "Hey man, nice to meet you,"And she'll take every one last time And I know, 'cause I found some fake love Ooh, broke as a bottle of wine Ooh, but drink with you all damn night Ooh, not trying to trade up'Cause if we don't find money Then what we got honey is just enough We got some rich love She'll say, "Hey man,"She'll say, "Hey man, nice to meet you,"She'll say, "Hey man, nice to meet you,"And she'll take every one last time and I knowWhen, when we came home Worn to the bones I told myself, "this could get rough"And when, when I was off, which happened a lot You came to me and said, "that's enough"Oh, I know that this love is pain But we can't cut it from out these veins, no So I'll hit the lights and you lock the doors We ain't leaving this room 'til we both feel more Don't walk away, don't roll your eyes They say love is pain, well darling, let's hurt tonight Ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh-ooh When, when you came home Worn to the bones I told myself, "this could get rough"Oh, I know you're feeling insane Tell me something that I can explain, ohHope when you take that jump, you don't fear the fall Hope when the water rises, you built a wall Hope when the crowd screams out, it's screaming your name Hope if everybody runs, you choose to stay Hope that you fall in love and it hurts so bad The only way you can know is give it all you have And I hope that you don't suffer but take the pain Hope when the moment comes, you'll say:I, I did it all I, I did it all I owned every second that this world could give I saw so many places, the things that I did With every broken bone I swear I lived Hope that you spend your days but they all add up And when that sun goes down hope you raise your cup I wish that I could witness all your joy and all your pain But until my moment comes, I'll say:I, I did it all I, I did it all I owned every second that this world could give I saw so many places, the things that I did With every broken bone I swear I livedWould you rescue me  Would you get my back Would you take my call when I start to crack Would you rescue me  Ah, would you rescue me Would you rescue me when I'm by myself When I need your love  If I need your help Would you rescue me  Ah, would you rescue me We don't talk much, not anymore Broken bottles and slammin' doors But we still care about each other Say we care about each other I know life took us far away But I still dream 'bout the good old days When we took care of each other We were livin' for each other But I start to wonder, wonder If I'm slipping under, under Would you rescue me  Would you get my back Would you take my call when I start to crack Would you rescue me  Ah, would you rescue me Would you rescue me when I'm by myself When I need your love, if I need your help Would you rescue me  Ah, would you rescue me Would you rescue me  Would you get my back Would you take my call when I start to crack Would you rescue me  Ah Would you rescue me  Would you rescue me when I'm by myself When I need your love, if I need your help Would you rescue me  Ah, would you rescue me These days my waves get lost in the oceans Seven billion swimmers, man I'm going through the motions Sent up a flare, I need love and devotion Traded for some faces that I never know, notion Maybe I should try to find the old me Take me to the places and the people that know me Tryna just connect, thinking maybe you could show me If there's so many people here, then why am I so lonely Can I get a connection Can I get, can I get a connection Can I get a connection Can I get, can I get a connection Real friends, good friends – hard to find, let's face it Buy the perfect home and there's a flood in the basement Made a couple dollars now, and I ain't tryna chase it Kids from Oklahoma, man, we don't waste it I'm just tryna paint the picture for me Something I could give a damn about in maybe 40 Years and I be ready and willing and able to edit the story Cause there's so many people here to be so damn lonely
