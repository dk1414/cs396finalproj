There's a love between us still But something's changed and I don't know why And all I wanna do is go home with you But I know I'm out of my mind I wanna touch you but I'm too late I wanna touch you but there's history I can't believe that it's been three years Now when I see you, it's so bittersweet There's a love between us still But something's changed and I don't know why And all I wanna do is go home with you But I know I'm out of my mind There's a love between us still But something's changed and I don't know why And all I wanna do is go home with you But I know I'm out of my mind You wanna touch me but you're too late You wanna touch me but there's too much history Starting to live the lies we tell ourselves I only need you to be friends with meDo I tell you I love you or not 'Cause I can't really guess what you want If you let me down, let me down slow If you let me down, let me down slow If you got feelings for me You just gotta speak honestly If you let me down, let me down slow If you let me down, let me down slow I'm on my own You're at the beach Hundreds of miles away I don't wanna be that girl I don't wanna be that girl I don't wanna give you up I don't wanna let you love somebody else but me So what's it gonna be So what's it gonna be I don't wanna give you up I don't wanna make it out like it's no big deal So what's it gonna be So what's it gonna be I've lost count Of how many times we've disagreed But it's the third time We've fought together this week Maybe it's nothin', maybe I just need time on my own Just once I'm gonna go and get drunk If you get my name wrong, I won't get pissed off'Cause I wish I was somebody else You know nothin' about me, I know nothin' about you But maybe the question mark helps Have you ever been lost We could get lost I wanna get lost Have you ever been lost We could get lost I wanna get lost I'm not sure If I'm just thinkin' 'bout it too much Or if I'm just lookin'For an excuse for us to break up Maybe I want to, maybe I need to Find a way to tell you that I wanna let you go Just once I'm gonna go and get drunkI turned up with my cap on back to front Trying to be someone I saw on T V once You were sitting by the window looking out for me We were trying to find a way to say "hi"That didn’t seem strange but it didn’t work out Maybe that was just the way that it felt to me It’s taken me so long Maybe I’m just too shy to say it We could be more than friends But maybe I’m just too shy Walking home down the Uxbridge road Headphones on I got a cigarette rolled I know I shouldn’t light it cause I haven’t smoked one for weeks Conversations running through my head Till I get stuck on one thing you should not have said but you said And now it’s all that I can think about It’s taken me so long Maybe I’m just too shy to say it We could be more than friends But maybe I’m just too shyDrinking whisky from a plastic cup As if it’s gonna make you Make your mind up Indecision by your own admission What you gonna do Don’t go looking at me as if I know Can’t work out what you mean I’ve got emotions of my own A tidal wave of feelings to ride, to ride Tell me why We can’t make this work It may be over but there’s something you should know You’ve got my love, boy You’ve got my love You’ve got my love, boy You’ve got my love You could travel until you find yourself Spend your money on expensive hotels Indecision by your own admission What you gonna do What you gonna do Сколько нам с тобой неба синегоМоря пенного, тела бренногоЧашу полную жизнь отмерилаВыбирай, выбирай, у реки два берегаУ реки два берегаУ реки два берегаУ реки два берегаТы не верь слезам, всё вернётсяПосле долгих ночейБылью сладкий сон обернётсяПосле долгих ночейРастекается свет невидимыйВсё отмечено старым именемРуки скованы вечным холодомТолько головы непокорныеНепокорныеНепокорныеНепокорныеYou're different, I like it You're from another planet And I'd like you to take me there You can fly your alien spaceship You're different, don't hide it That's what made me notice you There you were Sitting by yourself There you were Hey, hey, hey You are a white light Stepping out of the dark You are a white light But you cover it up Do you wanna fly a million miles away and be all alone 'Cause I don't mind if we never go, never go home Stepping out of the dark We're shoulder to shoulder Leaving for your universe And I can't control you Yeah, I can't control youOne girl on the last train Small change in the universe, and she Speaks to herself out loud Nobody ever looks up at her And she says"I wonder what you're thinking now Is there something that I could've said Would it have made a difference "Do you ever make it up Do you ever make it up Do wake up in the night and change your mind Do you ever make it up One line across town Her friends are calling cause they haven't seen her But she won't pick up the phone right now And they keep asking why she's been so quiet And, oh, do you wonder what she's thinking now Is there something that we could've said Would it have made a difference There's a love between us still But something's changed and I don't know why And all I wanna do is go home with you But I know I'm out of my mind I wanna touch you but I'm too late I wanna touch you but there's history I can't believe that it's been three years Now when I see you, it's so bittersweet There's a
