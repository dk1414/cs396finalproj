A-wouldn't it be nice To get on with me neighbours But they make it very clear They've got no room for ravers They stop me from groovin'They bang on me wall They're doin' me crust in It's no good at all, ah Lazy Sunday afternoon I've got no mind to worry A-close my eyes and drift away Here we all are, sittin' in a rainbow Gor blimey  Hello, Mrs  Jones How's your old Bert's lumbago He mustn't grumble I'll sing you a song With no words and no tune To sing on your khazi While you suss out the moon, oh yeahOver bridge of sighs To rest my eyes in shades of green Under dreamin' spires To Itchycoo Park, that's where I've been What did you do there I got high What did you feel there Well I cried But why the tears there I'll tell you why It's all too beautiful It's all too beautiful It's all too beautiful It's all too beautiful I feel inclined to blow my mind Get hung up, feed the ducks with a bun They all come out to groove about Be nice and have fun in the sunI am a little tin soldier That wants to jump into your fire You are a look in your eye A dream passing by in the sky I don't understand And all I need is treat me like a man'Cause I ain't no child Take me like I am I

 If I only could Yes  It's yeah!Oh yeah Yeah, if I could I'd say For meThere's wheat in the field And water in the stream And salt in the mine And an aching in me I can no longer stand and wonder'Cause I'm driven by this hunger So I'll jug some water, bake some flour Store some salt and wait the hour When thinking of love Love is thinking for me And the baker will come And the baker I'll be I'm depending on my labour The texture and the flavor I can no longer stand and wonder'Cause I'm driven by this hungerAre you all sitting comftybold, two square on your botty Then I'll begin Once upon a time in a land of greens Where the sky was silky soft and full of colored dreams Deep inside a rainbow lived Happiness Stan In a small Victoriana charabanc Evening will be here quite soon Stan can sit and watch the moon Watching as the white light slowly makes the night bright Hours slipping by while time stands still Think of black and black will think for you It's coloured Stan in bruises of the darkness that he knew For black had stolen half the moon away No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh No-oh-oh-oh No-oh-oh-oh I'm happy just to be with you And loving you the way I do There's everything I need to know Just resting in the afterglow of your Love, love is all around me, everywhere Love has come to touch my soul With someone who really cares No one can deny us People who once passed me by Will turn their heads 'round I'm happy just to be with you And loving you the way I do, yeah There's everything I need to know Just resting in the afterglow of your love You, yes you have always been here Feeling deep inside A feeling that I could not see Or touch, or try to hide My love is in and around you, hey I bless the day that I found you So listen up, babyWell, there she is parading on the quayside You can find her every night Waiting for a stevedore from Tyneside Why, it's Rene, the docker's delight And if you just got off an oil tanker And you've got the readies in the bin Just make your way down to the Crown & Anchor Ask for Rene  and you'll be well-in Well, she's Rene, the docker's delight And a ship's in every night Groping with a stoker from the coast of Kuala Lumpur Love is like an 'ole in the wall A line-up in the warehouse, no trouble at all If you can spare the money, you'll have a ball She'll have yours, ah Well, there's a kid of every shape and colour Safely hid in coal sheds, double-locked Well, it's been said that Rene is the mother I wonder, well, there you go And so, seaty comfortable on the back of this enormous buzzy most of the fly Vrrp, they tooked off, like an escaped velocy of the rocket floatin into orbit, yeah Now, after floating high hup, over the mounty, through the deep valley of that For seven whole long days, they did a very soft and flat belly landing, if I may put it this way Where they landed  A tranquil beauty spot, before a deep fundamold of a forry Like August in the undergrowth, there it was And the fly said it, "I must leave you here"And he pointed here, with his sort of fly type fingold, it was all feathery-feathery, and said"Mad John, mark me words""He liveth in a cave there in this far deep forry""And he will transport for you and find it, not only the moon itself which you looked""But the philosophy of life to itself."And Stan had a mutual joy for this, and reach up and cudlymost of this big fly, and very hard to embrace it and mode mmm, mmm kissy, and the fly tickled him with his whiskers in his eardrum And off he went There was an old man who lived in the greenwood Nobody knew him or what he had done But mothers would say to their children, "Beware of Mad John."John would sing with the birds in the morning Laugh with the wind in the cold end of night But people from behind their curtains, said he's not quite right
