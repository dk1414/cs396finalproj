It was late one night and we had a fight And it seemed like nothing was going right Then you turned around and you walked right out the door Now it's not the first time, it's not the last I know all about your checkered past And we played this game one thousand times before Do you remember the night  I can see it so clear All the sweet little things that you sang in my ear There were promises made, but I think you forgot what you said There's a real fine line between love and hate And I'm not the type to just sit and wait I've made up my mind, I can't wait for you anymore But when we kiss It feels like this And when we touch It means so much So many days go by and I still want you so If it was up to me, I'd never let you go You're the only true love in my life and I want you to know All this passion and pain, I think I'm going insane We've got nothing to lose and so much to gain If you love me today, who's to say you'd not leave me againI've never seen a boy who Looks as good as you tonight I'm feeling kind of fresh You know, I'm looking out of sight I know a little place That we can run away and hide And the only way to go Is on a magic carpet ride Come and take a ride with me I'll show you just how fun my love can be Put your heart into my hands I'll take you to a wonderland On my magic carpet Flying so high with my love to guide you On my magic carpet Nothing but sky and stars all around you Yeah, yeah I got a magic carpet Wanna take you for a ride You're getting kinda nervous I can see it in your eyesChill, baby Dancing In a dream of blue Dreaming That your love is true It can happen to me It can happen to you If you close your eyes I'm gonna be your three time lover Every night Crying Just to ease the pain Wishing You would come again It could happen to me It could happen to you If you close your eyes I'm gonna be your three time lover Every nightI remember when we met Everything was new The touch of your hand in mine I fell in love with you Running through the dark nights Passion lighting up our way Hear the echoes in the night This is what they say Me and you dancing in the wind Days of you dancing in the wind Feel the rhythm move me As we dance away the night With your arms around me Love until the morning light Running through the dark nights Passion lighting up our way Hear the echoes in the night This is what they say Me and you dancing in the wind Days of you dancing in the wind Me and you dancing in the wind Days of you dancing in the windYou've been hanging out with someone every night Did you think I really couldn't see Are you really worth the time it takes to fight Do you think you mean that much to me You'll never hurt me You'll never see the tears I cry You won't desert me But you keep me going round and round and I know all this by heart You tore my world apart I knew right from the start My bleeding heart I've been waiting for you with the lights still on Call you up to see what's on your mind Nothing left for me if I don't turn you on I'd call you back, but you're not worth the time You'll never hurt me You'll never see the tears I cry You won't desert me But you keep me going round and round and I know all this by heart You tore my world apart I knew right from the start My bleeding heartYou, won't you tell me what you want Won't you tell me all the things I want to hear Lying next to me Please, can we take another chance Can we make another try to get it right Baby, can't you see Don't you think that when we're here together Everything is all right I could sink into yours arms forever Can we make it through this night Hold me, hold me Please don't scold me tonight I want your body next to mine Hold me, hold me Please don't scold tonight I want your body next to mine Now
