The decent folk on All Souls' Night Light penny candles for the sweet repose Of dearly loved and soon forgot A word in St  Peter's ear, my darling Rose Such simple faith is really all it takes To rid the land of snakes But it could never break Kitty Ricketts' spell She is handsome, she is pretty She is the girl from Strumpet City Oh please can you tell mе who is she Kitty Ricketts, you're not thеre But I can touch your hair Kitty Ricketts, one, two, three You're a ghost but I don't care She's a carnal joy for Nighttown boys Whose five o'clock shadow begins at midnight She's an apron string for kings and poets Poets  Madmen  You should see the things they write!Well, they say that as you make your bed So must you lie But you could fall in love tonight But you'll never walk the streets of paradiseWe changed the world in a cellar wine bar Reached out and rearranged the stars Two empty hearts on an ocean liner Two empty bottles win a dreamer's battle Still haven’t reached the age of reason We didn’t know we could get hung for treason We knew the charges but never the crime The charges haunt them like a nursery rhyme Some mistake, there must be some mistake This emptiness is more than I can take Their laughter pierced through us and it went on forever‘Cause all they seemed to do was talk about the weather We changed it all though they never knew it We tore it down and made it better We fell in love though they never knew it And on the seventh day we lay together Still haven’t reached the age of reason Hey, didn’t you know you could get hung for treason We knew the charges but never the crime The charges haunt us like a nursery rhymeI've seen you in the eyes of women Sometimes in the eyes of men There are no limits to your travel You've been to every town I've been A strength so overpowering I have to break my stare I'm trying to ignore you But your glance is everywhere Dead the beast, dead the poison I've seen in places your supervision And in faces, I've seen your prison Dead thе beast, dead the poison You oncе came in the early hours But even though I did not wake An image of your hazy presence Remembered quite some time away And though you didn't tell me I'm burning deep inside The power of your feelings I somehow couldn't hideThe night reveals your soul Your soul is growing old Your destiny foretold The rain is pouring down And I've been wandering through the streets since ten Now it's nearly Monday And I'm walking home alone again What can I do when there's nothing to do Nothing to choose means nothing to lose In the pool hall, I'm no good at all Charlie is a shark and Dick knows all the tricks I've got to break out, I'm not a child My imagination's running wild I've done it your way since I was six Now I'm tired of dreams I gotta get my kicks The night reveals your soul Your soul is growing old Your destiny foretold The rain is pouring down And I've been wandering through thе streets since ten Now it's nearly Monday And I'm walking homе alone againThe Angelus bell rings out, with just a shadow of doubt And calls in vain to a city on its knees Where they know the Ten Commandments by heart But they never get caught ‘cause they’re too smart And words are only sacred if they’re true They always land on their feet They never lose any sleep They’ve got no future and the past is just for show They always land on their feet They never lose any sleep They never walk too fast or run too slow The patriot’s farewell kiss can turn adversity to bliss While the poet sings the catch-cries of the clown But the revolution in the air is somewhat the worse for wear The secret’s out and no-one really cares They always land on their feet They never lose any sleep They’ve got no future and the past is just for show They always land on their feet They never lose any sleep They never walk too fast or run too slowI’m Johnny Jukebox Survivor of the Ghostown Select yourself with care Why should I kick you when you’re down Here are my raves from the grave Your heroes and your villains All the pearls you couldn’t save You wear them like a chain Lend us a loan of your old gramophone I’ve just blown a fuse and I’m a long way from home A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams A shilling for your past Oh yes, I’m more than I seem You can cry on my shoulder If it makes it any better I guess we had to get older And the memories arе scratched Hey, end us a loan of your old gramophonе I’ve just blown a fuse and I’m a long way from home A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams A shilling for your past Oh yes, I’m more than I seemDesolation angels in a junkyard of lies Secret thinkers, spitting in their eyes Don't lock frustrations deep inside Shout out the truth they like to hide They're tryin' to get across But it's hard to make sense Robbed of something And we've got no defense If they took away your weekend You'd feel the pain alright I bet you'd stand up and fight Sometimes you just don't know who your enemies are You gotta understand we're on the same side Oh no you just don't know who your enemies are'Cause when the heat is on They run and hide and let us fight it out alone Don't wanna be a martyr to anybody's cause Just wanna break free from the savage jaws I don't want to change the world, just my own But sometimes I feel so aloneThis graveyard hides a million secrets And the trees know more than they will tell But the ghost of the saints and scholars will haunt you In heaven or in Hell Rattled by the Glimmerman, the Bogey-man, the Holy man And living in the shadows, in the shadows of a gunman Rattled like the coppers in your greasy till Rattled until time stood still Look across your shoulder and the school bell rings Another day of made-to-measure history Well I don’t mind if your heroes all have wings But your terrible beauty is torn Faithful departed We fickle hearted As you are now so once were we Faithful departed We the meek hearted With graces imparted Bring flowers to thee The girls from the kips proclaim their love for you When you stumbled in they knew you had a shilling or two But they cursed you on Sundays And Holy days of abstinence When you all stayed away And when you slept there A naked light bulb blinded your shame Your shadow on the wall took all the blame And the Sacred Hearts picture, compassion in His eyes Drowned out the river’s sighs Ah, let the grass grow green over the brewery tonight It’ll never come between the darkness and the light And there’s nothing too sick that it can’t be eased By the Devil’s holy water and a rosary beadsThere it goes!My phone is always ringing Why is there no one on the line I’ll sit and watch a movie on channel two I’ll think about it in the morning Sometimes I’m so narrow minded My vision's blinded by the cause Before the night is over I’ll slip into a second phase of wisdom Who are the strangers peeping inside Haunting, undaunted, their presence denied Why are thе strangers gathered in three Bеckoning fingers are calling for me You come on like a backseat driver But who’s taking who for a ride Can you help me walk on water Poetry in motion Do things I shouldn’t oughta I see shadows on my mirror I can’t see their point of view It’s confidential I’m just a fool It’s not essential To break the rules But you don’t know what my heart feels It’s not a toy Oh throw the dice decide my destiny I’m outrageous, you’re out to lunch You’re just worried about my hunch It’s confidential I’m just a fool It’s not essential To break the rules I am lonely but I don’t mind I’m not alone I guess it’s just my day to day routine
