My nerves are buzzin and my heart is gone I think I once was different but I might be wrong There's ghosts in the attic and bones on the wall But it's all right I don't care at all I'm yours, and you You're mine and that's That's all I know right now That's all That's all I know, right now It's dark outside except for pinpoint light Why a little gold tooth lost in a fight I'll duck outside pick it up from the street Stomp on it once and lay it at your feet I'm yours, and you You're mine and that's That's all I know right now That's all That's all I know Aw baby it's dark out there, but Aw baby it's dark in here, but Oh darlin I don't care, no, no The t.v.'s up against the wall like a painting While everybody here in the museum's fainting Well I myself have got froth on my lips It's delicious lady, won't you have a sip I'm yours, and you You're mine and that's That's all I know right now That's all That's all I know, right now I'm yours, and you You're mine and that's That's all I know right now That's all That's all I know, right nowI see the passionate who killed themselves with drink Or drugs or speeding cars in order not to think They must have felt like there just nothing was to do Oh why hast thou murdered those who see the most in search of a true thrill or clue Don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die..  There's something wrong here where the best ones want to go Parker, Lautreamont, Monroe they held it just to throw The world away who were its grace before they left To choose to have a point of view oblivious that leaves the rest of us bereft There I see the piercing eyes that look through all until they see their back There where any thought will think about itself and that's the only fact There a man has left just death, delirium, and drugs, or feel the lack The air is cool today the time is drawing near My walls are white and so's my brain afloat in self-made fear A banal feeling of the sort "I ain't insane"No fate worse than to never leave yourself and it's as well the most repulsive pain The air is cool today that whistles through my ribs My skull is full of sand that dribbles down upon my bib I call out "Baby" but her face looks like a clock Tick tock, alive, triumphant victims so surprised we can't recover from the shockHigh on your heels, your heels are wheels Metal will rattle Buttery leather a whole lot better Yes your slipper made Jack the Ripper Melt in his belt High heel shoes they kick the blues Your boots so pink that I can't think Your heels so high oh my we'll fly We'll move so fast won't nothin catch Our high heel wheels, our high heel wheels We'll steer by the stars in our high heeled cars Got your roots inside your boots Zipper goes ripper Foot to the floor we're out the door Your boots so pink that I can't think Your heels so high oh my we'll fly We'll move so fast won't nothin catch Our high heel wheels, our high heel wheels We'll steer by the stars in our high heeled carsI stood and stared at her face and nothin seemed to come And then she smiled and that look just licked me like a tongue Because love comes in spurts for sure Though sometimes it hurts far more You just get love in spurts I held her waist and her wrist and I kissed her in the hair Forgotten love started pumpin like a fountain inside there Because love comes in spurts for sure Though sometimes it hurts far more You just get love in spurts Oh darlin love'll come pump in your soul two feet deep Two minutes later alligators'll chew you in your sleep Because love comes in spurts for sure Though sometimes it hurts far more You just get love in spurts Oh my honey wipe the tears that streak down your cheek And don't you think I don't care, you only do 'cos you feel weak Because love comes in spurts for sure Though sometimes it hurts far more You just get love in spurts, in spurts, in spurts, in spurts..
