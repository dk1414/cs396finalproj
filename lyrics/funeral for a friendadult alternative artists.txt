Just to say we're sorry For the black eyes and bleeding lips When it's hard to forget How many lies we've told Or how old we'd grow Before I said goodbye So, let's scrape our knees On the playground It's not your fault you feel okay It's too late in the day It's not your fault you feel betrayed You can't come out to play I never listened to a word You never said I never listened to a word You never said Wasting the hours now We're all suckers for tragedies When start this over again And you bring us to our knees As sunrise comes And the story will sell There'll be a hundred papers So we'll follow you upTied to the testing of wills, where my heart breaks and spills Left to the sight of the sky, in your arms I'm Thrown to the wolves in the minds of your enemies In the minds of your enemies And I'm stone in the eyes of your foolishness If this is what I'm meant for, no longer interesting Fall forward to even the score Just a thought to you Tied to the testing of wills, where my heart breaks and spills Left to the sight of the sky, in your arms I'm Thrown to the wolves in the minds of your enemies In the minds of your enemies And I'm stone in the eyes of your foolishness And I'm nothing more than a line in your book Yet I'm nothing more than a line in your book Yet I'm nothing more than a line in your book Yet I'm nothing more than a line in your book In your book, in your book If this is what I'm meant for, no longer interesting Fall forward to even the score Just a thought to youDear friends of this academy Oooh romeo is bleeding to death To see a friend bleed to death, what for Some kind of metaphor that I can't see So I'll drink until I see it This sky will make me sick So I'll give up on you I'll give up on this This sky will make me sick So I'll give up on this I'll give up on you Archers in your arches Raise your fingers for one last salute And bleed this skyline dry Your history is mine So you want to hold me up and bring me down Yes, you want to hold me up and break me down I don't care for your sweet scent Or the way you want me more than I want you And I don't care for your sweet scent Or the way you want me more than I want you Archers in your arches Raise your fingers for one last salute And bleed this skyline dry Your history is mineWhen there's a rub We can talk for a while But I have sweet nothings to say You don't want me anyway You don't want me anyway So why Why should I stay So goodbye to you and your life Your new best friends Your confidence And I'll be here when you get home Sitting half way Away from no where Praying for our lips to touch Holding myself For a second Just to catch a smile On this line So goodbye to you and your life Your new best friends Your confidence And I'll be here when you get homeThe promise that he made Left broken on the floor The bruise left round your heart Left you begging for more The promise that he made Left broken on the floor The bruise left round your heart Left you begging for more Left you begging for more Thank you for making me worthless in your eyes In hope and desperation I'll find my only light In your white wedding dress In your white wedding dress Thank you for making this the best day of my life In hope and desperation I'll find my only light In your white wedding dress In your white wedding dress And in the mess of all we've seen I am open to everythingWhy do we need this Who was it that said that great things come to great men Well that fucker lied to us There's nothing here but a wasteland But I can still see The graves Of the dead But it's useless Most of us would rather sit Than to see this wound That we have created Let's not last the night Let's not last the night I'm sick and I'm tired Of always being the good guy I'm sick and I'm tired Of always being the good guy Senseless and I'm not sure why I'm not going to pretend That I know all the answers Or all of the questions It's got to be good for something So we'll chalk this up And we'll mount The dead On the fireplace Right above Right above Our gilded heads Above our gilded headsThe red poison of your lips The red poison of your eyes Is where I kissed the blood from Just that corner of your mouth where I can see the White of your smile Up to my neck When I'm breathing without you Without you Up to my eyes And I'm seeing without you Without you We'll start a fire And burn some bridges And make it out of here tonight We need some leverage We can't seem to open up The locks are far too tight And the chains are far too strong Far too strong Up to my eyes And I'm seeing without you Without you Up to my heart When I'm bleeding without you Without youCan't pretend that you're nothing special You've got to look at all of your options You can't decide what to go for when it's all about trust It's all about trust You see yourself on the T VYou read your magazines You can't explain how it's come to be this Stop and think When it's all about trust It's all about trust This coverage, your centre spread Your neon light daydream will shatter and break And if you think I'm thinking of your value here You're the one, you're the one who's losing control Oh, this eventual stop, this break in the mould I scream down this hotline just to feel something This eventual stop, this break in the mould I scream down this hotline just to feel something This situation isn't getting any better I see the look in your eyes You want to see a pretty face There isn't anything wrong with giving up And for what it's worth I still hate youAs the sun sets On battlefields I hope you can save me I hope you can save our wounded hearts And distance Makes my heart Go colder And distance Makes my heart Seem older It's just enough to cut the air From your lungs As the sun sets On battlefields I hope you can save me I hope you can save us from ourselves Denial In the arms of Our saviors And my heart Is torn Into pieces Its just enough to cut the air From your lungs Just to say we're sorry For the black eyes and bleeding lips When it's hard to forget How many lies we've told Or how old we'd grow Before I said goodbye So, let's scrape our knees On the playground It's not your fault you feel okay It's too late in the day It's not your fault you feel betrayed You can't come out to play I never listened to a word You never said I never listened to a word You never said Wasting the hours now We're all suckers for tragedies When start this over again And you bring us to our knees As sunrise comes And the story will sell There'll be a hundred papers So we'll follow you
