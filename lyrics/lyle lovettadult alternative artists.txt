If I had a boat, I'd go out on the ocean And if I had a pony, I'd ride him on my boat And we could all together go out on the ocean Me upon my pony on my boat If I were Roy Rogers, I'd sure enough be single I couldn't bring myself to marrying old Dale It'd just be me and Trigger We'd go riding through them movies Then we'd buy a boat and on the sea we'd sail And if I had a boat, I'd go out on the ocean And if I had a pony, I'd ride him on my boat And we could all together go out on the ocean Me upon my pony on my boat The mystery masked man was smart, he got himself a Tonto'Cause Tonto did the dirty work for free But Tonto he was smarter And one day said, "Kemosabe Kiss my ass, I bought a boat I'm going out to sea"And if I had a boat, I'd go out on the ocean And if I had a pony, I'd ride him on my boat And we could all together, go out on the ocean Me upon my pony on my boatI went to church last Sunday So I could sing and pray But something quite unusual It happened on that day Church, it started right on time Just like it does without a doubt And everything was all just fine Except when it came time to let us out You know, the preacher, he kept preaching He told us, "I have one more thing to say Children, before you think of leaving You'd better think about the Judgment Day"Now everyone got nervous Because everyone was hungry too And everyone was wondering What was the next thing he would do And the preacher, he kept preaching He said, "Now I'll remind you, if I may You all better pay attention Or I might decide to preach all day"That picture hanging on the wall Was painted by a friend He gave it to me all down and out When he owed me ten It doesn't look like much, I guess But it's all that's left of him It sure is nice from right over here When the light's a little dim Step inside this house, girl I'll sing for you a song I'll tell you about just where I've been It shouldn't take too long I'll show you all the things that I own My treasures, you might say It couldn't be more then ten dollars worth They brighten up my day This book of poems was given me By a girl I used to know I guess I read it front to back Fifty times or so It's all about the good life And staying at ease with the world It's funny how I love that book And I never loved that girlIn the darkest hour In the dead of night As the storm clouds gather And the lightning strikes And the thunder rolls And the cold rain blows The future, it holds What, God only knows And I will rise up I said yes and amen And I will stand tall Until I meet my end You should have been on the river Back in nineteen-and-four You could have found you a dead man Lord, at every turn rowHello I'm the guy who sits next to you And reads the newspaper over your shoulder Wait Don't turn the page I'm not finished Life is so uncertain Here I am Yes it's me Take my hand And you'll see Here I am Yes it's true All I want Girl is you Given that true intellectual and emotional compatibility Are at the very least difficult If not impossible to come by We could always opt for the more temporal gratification Of sheer physical attraction That wouldn't make you a shallow person Would it Here I am Yes it's me Take my hand And you'll see Here I am Yes it's true All I want Girl is youAnd I like cream in my coffee And I like to sleep late on Sunday And nobody knows me like my baby And I like eggs over easy with flour tortillas And nobody knows me like my baby And nobody holds me And nobody knows me Nobody knows me like my baby But it was a dream made to order south of the border And nobody knows me like my baby And she cried, "Man, how could you do it "And I swore that there weren't nothing to it But nobody knows me like my baby And nobody holds me And nobody knows me Nobody knows me like my baby And I like cream in my coffee And I hate to be alone on Sunday And nobody knows me like my babyYou've got a friend in me You've got a friend in me When the road looks rough ahead And you're miles and miles From your nice warm bed You just remember what your old pal said Boy, you've got a friend in me Yeah, you've got a friend in me You've got a friend in me You've got a friend in me If you've got troubles, I've got 'em too There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you We stick together and can see it through'Cause you've got a friend in me Yeah, you've got a friend in me Some other folks might be A little bit smarter than I am Bigger and stronger too, maybe But none of them will ever love you The way I do, it's me and you, boyThis old porch is like a big old red and white Hereford bull Standing under a mesquite tree out in Agua Dulce And he just keeps on playing hide and seek with that hot August sun Just a-sweatin' and a-pantin' 'cause his work is never done And this old porch is like a steaming, greasy plate of enchiladas With lots of cheese and onions and a guacamole salad And you can get 'em down at the La Salle Hotel in old downtown With iced tea and a waitress and she will smile every time And this old porch is the Palace walk-in on the main street of Texas That's never seen the day of G and R and X's With that '62 poster that's almost faded down And a screen without a picture since Giant came to town And this old porch is like a, a weathered, gray-haired seventy years of Texas Who's doing all he can not to give in to the city And he always takes the rent late, so long as I run the cattle And he picks me up at dinnertime and I listen to him rattleIt's a simple song for simple feeling You see the moon and watch it rise Across the continent the night bird sings And somewhere someone hears its cry So disillusioned, keep your head down If you do they'll never know You'll have no answers to their questions And they will have to let you go And disenfranchised revolution They'll take away by right what's yours And make you martyrs of your own cause When they don't know what cause it's for And all deserted stand alerted They'll love you when you're all alone But you find a red rose in the morning light You wait the night and find it gone So hear my words with faith and passion For what I say to you is true And when you find the one you might become Remember part of me is youIf I had a boat, I'd go out on the ocean And if I had a pony, I'd ride him on my boat And we could all together go out on the ocean Me upon my pony on my boat If
