Yeah I wake up every morning with my head up in a daze I'm not sure if I should say this, fuck, I'll say it anyway Everybody tries to tell me that I'm goin' through a phase I don't know if it's a phase, I just wanna feel okay, yeah I battle with depression, but the question still remains Is this post-traumatic stressin' or am I suppressin' rage And my doctor tries to tell me that I'm going through a phase Yeah, it's not a fuckin' phase, I just wanna feel okay Okay, yeah, I struggle with this bullshit every day And it's probably 'cause my demons simultaneously rage It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me'Cause I'm about to break down I'm searchin' for a way out I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer I'm a popular, popular monster I break down Falling into love now With falling apart I'm a popular, popular monsterDo I know you Yes, you do This seems so familiar You're in a dream Who are you I am your reflection You've been asleep for a very long time I lay awake every night, looking back on my life Will apologies to the people I love for the things I've done really make it right I guess it might, just then I realized My past is the reason I'm here right now, as a matter of fact, I won't apologize You bitches always pissed 'cause I am constantly changing Think of how far that I've made it from my incarceration, it's amazing, ain't it But I'm in the zone, I'm a rolling stone I'm coming home, but I'm not alone Do I really gotta let another motherfucker know No, I won't surrender, surrender No, I won't let you bring me down So where the hell do I go from here Who do I believe, who do I believe when everyone Feels so insincere Like everyone's out to get me Who will save my life How do I believe, how do I believe in anyone Please, don't mind me I just kill myself sometimesI heard a knock upon my door the other day I opened it to find death staring in my face The feel of mortal stalking still reverberates Everywhere I go, I drag this coffin just in case My body's trembling sends shivers down my spine Adrenaline kicks in, shifts into overdrive Your secrets keep you sick, your lies keep you alive Snake eyes every single time you roll with crooked dice I felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down The kind of dark that haunts a hundred-year-old house I wrestle with my thoughts, I shook the hand of doubt Running from my past, I'm praying: "Feet, don't fail me now"I've lost my goddamn mind, it happens all the time I can't believe I'm actually meant to be here Trying to consume, the drug in me is you And I'm so high on misery, can't you see I got these questions always running through my head So many things that I would like to understand If we are born to die and we all die to live Then what's the point of living life if it just contradicts Yeah, I got voices in my head again, tread carefully And I don't medicate, it helps me temporarily I got problems, I got issues, yeah, apparently Trauma that I'm burying, I think I need some therapy I battle depression, I'm back with a message I'm asking the question that if you hate me, why you acting obsessive I'm past the point of no return, fuck being passive aggressive I'll brandish a weapon, teach all you motherfuckers a lesson, yeah I actually battle my demons and shadows They swim in the deep and they creep in the shallows, I'm lost I gotta admit that I'm living the life that I've always wanted But it comes at a cost, they're licking their chops, they're fixing to rip me a part, I'm swimming with sharks I'm lifting the bar, I'm lifting it into the stars I'm like a shot of adrenaline, mixed with some Ritalin You started a battle, but bitch, I'ma finish it You think you can stop me, not even a little bit Nowadays everybody's so sensitive Taking my words and you pick it a part Tripping on nothing just get in the car Gripping and ripping I'm sticking the mark I'm tipping the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-charts I got enemies trying to get rid of me Evil tendencies are fucking with me mentally I got people that don't like me in the industry I can feel your energy, you are not a friend to me'Cause I have been to places that you never wanna go, yeah I got dirt on people, but they act like I don't know, yeah I could do some damage, but I'll never rock the boat All it takes is one post, watch 'em fall like dominoes You'll never get rid of me, too many mini-me's ripping my imagery You know my history, it ain't a mystery I put every enemy outta they misery Somebody send me some positive energy About to go Darth, about to go Disney Into the darkness, into infinity and Shut you motherfuckers up, you listening Stacking every little pretty penny that I'm getting And I'm never giving in to anybody, always winning Never kidding when I die, I'm taking everybody with me You're never gonna get me, 'cause you'll never see it simply I'm a motherfucking god, you're a light yawn I'm a time bomb and the vibes wrong, is this mic on I'm killing the syllables with a loaded refillable I'm a lyrical typical supervillain, I'm venomous And I'm never gonna stop until they put me on top of the list'Cause everybody's on drugs Kill yourself is what they said to me I'm already dead, just differently They say God is real, I disagree'Cause if that were true Then we'd all be free, all be free, ya, ya Running from something that's killing me Dealing with such an uncomfortable feeling Beginning to feel the hostility from my ability Of slowly becoming the villain I just wanna thank all my fans especially Without you is the death of me I don't consider myself a celebrity But I'll be doing this shit 'til I'm 70 This is my destiny, this is the best of me It's an incredible feeling to grow Letting it go, I'm letting you know We're killing ourselves on the low Everybody wants some, everybody gets none from me'Cause everybody's on drugs It's hard to believe, the American dream is a killing machine We're all falling in love with a new disease If it's killing you, then it's murdering me It's all getting so unbelievable We're having so much fun, staring down a loaded gun And you don't see that it's killing you'Cause everybody's on drugsI've got the motherfucking world in my palm now, don't tell me to calm down Striking a match, igniting the track while I'm typing in caps, it's on now The rap Casanova with cash in a sofa in the back of a Rover Six-pack in a backpack, and I'm cracking 'em open; sipping, I'm trapped in a moment Open your eyes 'cause you're never gonna know if your next move might be your last Living a lie, everybody's always gonna bring up my past Well, I'm past that, interest up, and my bag's packed I'm the N AS DA Q with a bad rap, so I'm not ready to change, I'm doing my thing You're pointing the blame You know I'm not ready to choose, so don't get confused And stay the hell out of my way So why do you believe You're losing your mind, losing your mind again In everyone but me I'm losing my mind, losing my mind again I've seen the hardships, lived in darkness, through the mud, into the marshes My reputation is tarnished; but regardless, I am awesome Saw the gossip from my lockup go colossal, then I blossomed to the boss of this rock stuff And I'm never gonna stop till the cops come What I'm really trying to say Is say it to my face, and if you won't, stay the fuck out my way Rocking shows, lock and load, stop me  No I'm repping the new shit, the essence of music, I'm blessed with the fusion of bothZombified The monsters aren't living under your bed'Cause they are the voices in your head Zombified by the lies they've said We've become the walking dead'Cause everybody's talking that sh—Oh no, they'll never let go Of something you said ten years ago They're canceling, canceling you And they won't stop 'til everybody's Zombified They're pumping us with lies Like it's formaldehyde They're dead inside It goes on and on, let this go When it stops, we'll never know We're hypnotized And they won't stop 'til you're ZombifiedWell, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one Sometimes I sleep all day because I hate the sunlight My hands are always shaking, body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me And whiskey seems to be my holy water Mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters I'm insane, well, I can feel it in my bones Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold For goodness sake's, where is my self-control If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today Self-induced comatose, chemical daze My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up Hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict Daddy should've never raised me on Black SabbathSo why do good girls like bad guys I had this question for a real long time I've been a bad
