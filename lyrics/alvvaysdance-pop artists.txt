Rode here on the bus, now you're one of us It was magic hour Counting motorbikes on the turnpike One of Eisenhower's Live your life on a merry-go-round Who starts a fire just to let it go out If I saw you on the street Would I have you in my dreams tonight If I saw you on the street Would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight On a weird guitar, said you wrote a while In the waking hour In fluorescent light, antisocialites Watch a wilting flower Live your life on a merry-go-round Who builds a wall just to let it fall down You've expressed explicitly your contempt for matrimony You've student loans to pay and will not risk the alimony We spend our days locked in a room, content inside a bubble And in the nighttime we go out and scour the streets for trouble Hey, hey Marry me, Archie Hey, hey Marry me, Archie During the summer, take me sailing out on the Atlantic I won't set my sights on other seas, there is no need to panic So, honey, take me by the hand and we can sign some papers Forget the invitations, floral arrangements and bread makers Hey, hey Marry me, Archie Hey, hey Marry me, Archie Too late to go out Too young to stay in They're talking about Us living in sinHow do I get close to you Even if you don't notice As I admire you on the subway When it's dark outside your house You won't let anybody out And keep a padlock on the door, well One more cocktail And I'm on your trail If I should fall Act as though it never happened I will retreat And sit inside so very quietly How do I grow old with you Even if you don't notice As I pass by you on the sidewalk When it's dark outside your house You won't let anybody out You're keeping a dead girl in the closetYou find a wave and try to hold on for as long as you can You made a mistake you'd like to erase and I understand"What's left for you and me " I ask that question rhetorically Can't buy into astrology, and won't rely on the moon for anything No turning, there's no turning There's no turning back after what's been said No turning, there's no turning There's no turning back Meditate, play solitaire, take up self defense When you get old and faded out, will you want your friends What's left for you and me  You respond to my question metaphorically Don't read into psychology and won't rely on your mood for anything No turning, there's no turning There's no turning back after what was said No turning, there's no turning There's no turning back after what's been said You find a wave and try to hold on for as long as you can You made a mistake you'd like to erase and I understand What's next for you and me  I'll take suggestions We toss and turn in undertow, time to let goNow that you’re not my baby, I'll go do whatever I want No need to turn around to see what’s behind me, I don’t care And it’s true, I’ve been checking out lately, I go do whatever I want No need to turn around to see what’s behind me, I don’t care Because I’m really not there I’m really not there And now that you’re not my baby I’ll go do whatever I want No need to sit at home with the dial tone'Cause I don’t care And it’s true, I’ve been going out lately And I go do whatever I want You can write it down with a fountain pen Close your eyes and then count to ten You can tell your friends that I don’t make sense And I don’t care Because I’m really not there I'm really not thereWalking through the trees, I never really know what's on your mind Is it ever me, or just someone you've left behind Floating through a dream, I never could make out the words you said Sentences are bouncing back and forth inside my head You don't have to leave, you could just stay here with me Forget all the party police, we can find comfort in debauchery Fighting through the fog, I can't believe it rained all summer long When every day's a hurricane, you know there's something wrong I see you every day, it's hard to figure out what happens next I cannot decipher conversation in your head You don't have to leave, you could just stay here with me Forget all the party police, we can find comfort in debauchery You don't have to leave, you could just stay here with me Forget all the local police, we can find comfort in biology We wrote our names on the overpass and I hope it lasts forever Don't have to You don't have toTake, take from the ones who love you, ooh Leave, leave with the ones who don't, ooh Lie, lie to the ones who like you ooh Lay, lay with the ones who won't When lightning strikes I will be on my bike I won't be stuck inside I will be taking flight They, they are the ones who love you, ooh We, we are the ones who don't, ooh Hang up on the ones who need you, ooh Watch out for the ones who won't When lightning strikes I'll be on my bike I won't be stuck inside I will be taking flight And when the wheels come off I'll be an astronaut But I won't be lost in space I will be skipping rocksWe walked along the rocks for nearly an hour I caught the way you looked at me in the sunlight You took something before you went in the shower To help suppress the things that make you feel uptight If I'd known you couldn't swim We would never have gone in I left my love in the river The only one who sees I lost his hand in the current It was the life I wanted and I'd hoped for And now I am left sifting through the leaves The sun so hot, I saw his skin through his t-shirt The grass so tall, we knew we wouldn't be found We climbed into the stream so no one would be heard And in no time at all, there wasn't a sound If I'd known you couldn't swim We would never have gone inI lie on a sofa awake It's what you said last night You'd like us on top of a cake But you won't let me take a bite Flowers arriving in fleets Can't we talk about this Why let the State in our sheets Can't we do without it Well, I don't mean to wind you up But I'd like to slow it down How do I remain a pup If you put me in a gown What's it got to do with you What's it got to do with me How could I lose control When you're driving from the backseat What's it got to do with you What's it got to do with me How could I lose control When you're driving from the backseat When I chip through your candy coating You're stuffed with insulation Just strawberry ice cream floating With a sprinkle of indignation Cherry under knot of shoestring Conflate and agitate You're a plimsoll punk You're a plimsoll punk And you're gettin' me down, gettin' me down, gettin' me down Gettin' me down down down, you're gettin' me down Gettin' me down, gettin' me down, gettin' me down Plimsoll punk Your posture's blocking out any possible light I can hardly see This conversation spirals into a fight I can barely breathe Who ran from Roman candles Underneath a willow weeping Do the tealights on your mantel Illuminate that summer feeling You're the seashell in my sandal That's slicing up my heel
