Go I could go on talking or I could stop Wring out each memory 'til I get every drop Sift through the details of the others involved The true crime would be thinking it's just one person's fault Like an honest signature on a fake I DLike the guilty conscience with the innocent plea You can just ignore it, put it out of mind But ain't it funny how the past won't ever let something lie Let's make a list of all the things the world has put you through Let's raise a glass to all the people you're not speaking to I don't know what else you wanted me to say to you Things happen, that's all they ever do In a different time, on a different floor I might mourn the loss of who I'm not anymore So I'm driving out to Oakland for a good look back And a few revisions to my plan of attackWith his back against the San Francisco traffic On the bridge's side that faces towards the jail Setting out to join a demographic He hoists his first leg up over the rail A phone call's made, police cars show up quickly The sergeant slams his passenger door He says, "Hey son why don't you talk through this with me Just tell me what you're doing it for""Oh, it's a little bit of everything It's the mountains, it's the fog It's the news at six o'clock It's the death of my first dog""It's the angels up above me It's the song that they don't sing It's a little bit of everything"There's an older man who stands in a buffet line He is smiling and he's holding out his plate And the further he looks back into his timeline That hard road always led him to today Making up for when his bright future had left him Making up for the fact his only son is gone And letting everything out once, his server asks him"Have you figured out yet, what it is you want "Late night drives and hot french fries And friends around the country From Charlottesville to good old Santa Fe When I think of you, you still got on that hat that says "Let’s Party!"I hope that thing is never thrown away I hope that life without a chaperone is what you thought it’d be I hope your brother’s El Camino runs forever I hope the world sees the same person That you’ve always been to me And may all your favorite bands stay together Now I’m just waking up and I’m not thinking clearly so don’t quote me With one eye open, I'm writing you this song Ain’t it funny how some people pop into your head so easily I haven’t seen you in there for so long I hope that life without a chaperone is what you thought it’d be I hope your brother’s El Camino runs forever I hope the world sees the same person that you always were to me And may all your favorite bands stay togetherI will do your interview Try to explain what I'm going through Give you something to read into In a million different ways A sick version of telephone Starts at the clip of the microphone A game we thought we had all outgrown But still everybody plays Ignoring all of the remedies Believing all of the rumors With their endless database I wanna sit with my enemies And say, "We should have done this sooner"While I look them in the face Maybe that will crack the case I got a friend who's been thinking 'bout Finally kicking her husband out His second life as a talent scout Finally got him caught While she was throwing out all his clothes She heard a voice from beyond the throes"Punish him for the life he chose But forgive the past that he did not"Hey kid at the show tonight--The face beyond the barricade How ya dance and ya sing to every single line Like it was you up on that stage I need to know your secret I'm asking you for help How do I fall in love with anything Like you seem to do so well I gotta get back to when it came out The way it was supposed to sound Before money was ever changing hands And my feet were on the ground When I could feel the wind's direction When I knew what songs to sing And he said, "Try not to get upset Let it all go by Because how can it be that bad If we're all gonna die "Soon I started to think about That girl that disappeared And if it really was the road that pulled me away Or if I'm still a victim of my fearsI buckle in my seatbelt and plug my headset in a chair And to the music, I watch flight attendants move They are pointing out the exits, but it looks more like a prayer Or an ancient dance their bloodline reaches through These planes are good for sifting through The warriors from the men I get time to sit and watch them for a while You can see everywhere they're going And everywhere they've been In how they look out at the clouds each time they smile And I think 'maybe he's in town for someone's birthday Or maybe he makes trouble everywhere But as much he resists the conversation Between the rivers and the freeways He knows it's always there'As the Northwest Passage sits somewhere below me as I sleep I dream of captains and explorers eating boots When I ask if I can join them, and they offer one to me I wake up as my home comes into viewI never could admit when I was wrong, man Even when I felt it in my bones I always thought it meant I was a strong man And I wondered why I was alone That's when she stepped out of the ether Right when I was ready for a dance She said 'I don't know what I am doing either But I know when to take a chance'I never knew how to be scared Til I found something I knew I couldn't lose And then a revelation trembled From the tip of my own tongue And like the last few boys at the Alamo Like Cusack holding that stereo Or what Juliet hears from Romeo:"I'm never gonna say goodbye"There's not a way to someone's heart that she can't see She lives and loves with everything she's got My dark days showed me how to ask, "Why me "She's shown me how to ask, "Why not "If she listens very carefully to a room of conversation She can feel the planet orbiting through space She hears pieces of arguments, beginnings of jokes And the odd lines of a song she cannot place And it all makes up an image that resists interpretation Which is lately how she likes to see herself How she does not believe in accidents, doesn't disagree out loud And falls in love with every man she cannot help And she thinks most people don't talk enough about how lucky they are Most people don't know what it takes for me to get through the day Most people don't talk enough about the love in their hearts But she doesn't know most people feel that same way If she focuses her energies on just walking through the neighborhood With depths and shallows nobody could sound Like January Christmas lights under billion year old stars She comes up with more of what is lost than what is found So by the time that she explains to me Just a glimpse of what she's understood She betrays the meaning putting it in words So she smiles at me lovingly and says, "Just let me hold your hand So far it's the only way I can let myself be heard"I know all of my exits I'm always planning my escape It's the most aggressive symptom Of this collective phantom pain And the more that you ignore it The more it makes you go insane Just look around It's the battle of the passwords It's the trumpets on the hill It's that constant paranoia It's the final fire drill And if you won't sing the anthem They'll go find someone else who will They're cracking down We're living in the future, so shine a little light It may not make it any better, I'm just hoping that it might I'm not talking about forever, how about just getting through the night We're living in the future, so shine a little light I'm always looking over shoulders Not knowing what I’m looking for Now that the feeling someone's watching Isn't just a feeling anymore Now that both sides of the aisle Are this good at keeping score We've crossed a lineI'm sad about the messages you're sending I'm sad about the shit we're doing wrong I'm sad about the never-ending love we're in We keep pissing on the fire, but it keeps burning so strong Can we both just say "I love you," and get it on Your boy from Birmingham seems nice enough to me But unqualified for you, and your heavy vibes He doesn't know the troubled story that he's written himself into He doesn't know he's just a place for you to hide You wanna tell him "Best of luck, man Roll Tide"Roll Tide It can't be easier to swim, when the water's high Roll Tide When what we want the most has us terrified Roll Tide If we don't want to let go, then we have to fight Roll Tide Roll Tide I'm asking now for reconciliation I'm asking now for what we have to say I'm asking now for both of us to do a little changing I wanna dance with you forever, in this quantum cabaret If we just allow ourselves, it'll be okay
