In every breath there's life Between my teeth a knife Pronounced us man and wife Forevermore Cause once you've found your thrill You move in for the kill I'd chase you up the hill And all through time And now my memory Seems to be failing me What once was fantasy Is all I've ever known The thing I miss the most Lives in some demon host I know you're not a ghost Just down the street I am a spinning man A living ceiling fan If two could only hang In the same room once againI'm lost in the light I pray for the night To take me, to take you too After so many words Still nothing's heard Don't know what we should do So if someone could see me now Let them see you'Twas my greatest thrill When we just stood still You let me hold your hand 'til I had my fill Even counting sheep Don't help me sleep I just toss and turn right there beside ya So if someone could help me now They'd help you too They'd help you too See you through All the hard things we've all gotta do'Cause this life is long So you wouldn't be wrong Being free, leaving me on my ownI got all the time in the world Don't you want some of that I got all the time in the world Don't you want some of that Don't you want some of that I would, if I were you I had All  the  time  in the world You wanted none of that I had All  the  time  in the world You wanted none of that You wanted none of that I would if I were you Put my Work  in  front  of my girl There's something wrong with that Put my Work  in  front  of my girl There's something wrong with that Something really, really wrong with that I know this to be trueAnd I held the breath inside my lungs for days And I saw myself as one of many waves And when I knew I'd become the ocean's slave I just stayed And we carried far with all the waters past Of the waves I was not first I was not last And if we saw a boat afloat we took the mast So fast There's a part of it that I'll miss At the heart of it, your cold kiss From the start of it, I know this Always a part of it And before too long the waves grew out of hand And they worked to keep the sea at their command And the only thing they feared it seemed the sand And dry land There's a part of it that I'll miss At the heart of it, your cold kiss From the start of it, I know this Always a part of itI had a way with words for a while You call it substance over style Now I hear laugh but I don't see a smile I had a way with words for a while If I had've known I would've stuck around'Cause what kinda man lets his brother down Oh, while I was gone think about all that you found A dear old friend and a brand new sound I am one man I can do anything We are not far We can do anything Is the whole thing just a test Is there something you should get off your chest Don't keep me waiting on some S MS Don't keep it all so close to the vest I am one man I can do anything We are not far We can do anything Our return will come some day The three of us will laugh and play I know that we can find a wayHold me, Plain tee Desert boots and white jeans So clean Old ways, long days Lost inside my own maze Manmade My own timezone Life lived through some smartphone Full grown Clean life, ex wife Treats me like some dull knife That ain't right My privilege is done I don't know that I can make a difference My privilege is done I don't know that I can make a difference Old pain, no name It's not hard to lay blame Blame gameI feel it through my shoes They used to call that the blues Now they call it depression Everywhere I go Yes I get to feel so low If I got depression My wife don't want no part of me And yes that fact is hard on me That's true I give the doctor a description And he just writes a prescription Or two Peace and quiet were here before But they both walked out the door And left me with depression I hardly leave my room Most days I sleep 'till noon If I got depression Most folks think I'm fine But the truth is I'm subprime I've got depressionIn every breath there's life Between my teeth a knife
