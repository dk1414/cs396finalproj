I could have been easier on you I could have been all you held onto I know I wasn't fair, I tried my best to care about you I know I could have been a better man But I always had to have the upper hand I'm struggling to see the better side of me But I can't take all your jabs and taunts You're pointing out my every fault And you wonder why I walked away When you tell me I'm a wreck You say that I'm a mess How could you expect anything less You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along I told you when you asked I knew this wouldn't last At least I could be honest about that And now you're telling everyone How I only did you wrong I guess you never knew me at all Remember on my 21st birthday You took me where we went on our first date We stayed till closing time, after 4 glasses of wine You started with a pointless argument You said that I forgot to compliment The dress you wore that night That I've seen a thousand times But I think we just want different things I want space, you want a diamond ring Whatever made you think we were meant to be Take me home tonight I don't wanna let you go 'til you see the light Take me home tonight Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang I feel a hunger It's a hunger That tries to keep a man awake at night Are you the answer I shouldn't wonder When I feel you wet my appetite With all the power you're releasing It isn't safe to walk the city streets alone Anticipation is running through me Let's find the key and turn this engine on I can feel you breathe I can feel your heartbeat faster Take me home tonight!I don't want to let you go till you see the light!Take me home tonight!Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang"Be my little baby!", ohIt was the type of feeling that can't be explained The way she moved her lips drove me insane Now I'm left here in the wake of something more She made it hard to leave as she stood by the door In a v-neck T-shirt and nothing more than A single tear rolling down her cheek, whoa Don't go away again I want to be more than a phone call at 4am Seems like every time you come back home It's just to steal my heart and leave Don't go away again I want to be more than a story to tell your friends Seems like every time you come back home It's just to make me fall again It's getting hard, I know, believe me I feel you I can't fall asleep knowing you're not home Is it too much to ask, can't you just pick up the phone We've had our share of fights I know it's not easy when I'm never home I have my own dreams Like you have your life planned out back homeYou, you got a way of keeping Me on my toes and you got a way Of thinking whatever you do goes And I really don't mind cause you Keeping me amused and you treated My love to your god damn crazy moods And I, I forgive you I forgive you for the truth I liked you better When you lied, and I forgive you being you Cause you were better when you faked every smile And know your knocking on my front door that's what I've been living for excuse me while I laugh my ass off I forgive you for your ways now that I finally got away I, I'm gonna miss watching you while you sleep Cause that was the only time I ever found some peace I use to believe it was me who was insane, but now I Take it back cause compared to you I'm O KAnd I, I forgive you I forgive you for the truth I liked you better When you lied, and I forgive you being you Cause you were better when you faked every smile And now you're knocking on my front door that's what I've been living for excuse me while I laugh my ass off I forgive you for your ways now that I finally got awayLeaving your tears on my shoulder Your eyes beg me to stay We were finally changing It's our luck, we're a little too late I'd take you with me if there was a way Sorry, don't cut it so I say Take all of your doubts You can throw 'em out You may be unsure, but I know I'm always coming back You can bet on that You're the only place I call home Near or far, where you are is where I want to be Every lonely night Every drunken fight Couldn't make it right, I know If it hurts you bad Put it on my tab I can pay it back tenfold You're the only place I've ever called my home Years pass, we're growing older And you're not sure you can wait So I promise, it won't always be like this You say "It's always the same"We're falling apart if you think so I'm holding on even if you let goAnother late night drivin' around We're losing sunlight so we head downtown To Woodward off Charlotte Street The old place that we used to meet We were young and we lived it up But those nights never lasted long enough Looking back we were so na√Øve What happened to the days we shared our dreams If I could go back now I wouldn't change a thing Oh, it feels so good To say Guess we made it this far Guess we're doing alright Looks like we made it out alive Yeah , we made our mistakes But we followed our hearts Even though we drift apart For always, forever Weathered yellow still frames in my head For always, foreverTell me it's over Tell me we finally made it through The comfort in silence turns to panic once again We're caught in a landslide We're dirty we're broken black and blue The feeling is lost in every signal that we send How can a love hurt this bad How could we lose all that we had Why do we follow through What keeps us hanging on We lived like a storm and let it ride For all of the times we felt alive But sometimes love just can't make you stay When you're happy the hard way Say what you can't say Say it's the end say anything There's something to find in all the places that you fear Lost in the moment when it's only me and you There is no other place I'd rather be but here And those are the only times that make the world disappear How can a love hurt this bad How could we lose all that we had Why do we follow through What keeps us hanging on We lived like a storm and let it ride For all of the times we felt alive But sometimes love just can't make you stay When you're happy the hard wayThis might be my last chance So maybe i should take it I just hope your listening To everything i'm sayin I miss the long drives, the car rides The bad fights, the good times The way you make me feel Will never leave my mind Think of you later in my empty room Where i, i, will fall asleep alone Think of you later in my empty room Where i, i will fall asleep alone So quit your cryin And wipe the tears from your eyes Cause this is see you later, i'm not into goodbyes Watch the brake lights as i leave the driveway The long nights will stay beside me No matter where i go Think of you later in my empty room Where i, i, will fall asleep alone Think of you later in my empty room Where i, i, will fall asleep aloneEverything you own In a suitcase by the door The words that keep you home Are failing Everything we take Out in anger Eventually we'll break Down to answers That are ringing in my head Slow down Take a deep breath We can't give up tonight Is it right to sit and watch this die We're slowly letting go Like its better left alone So erase the damages we've made The story left untold is better than you know Is better than you know Of all the nights we spent wrapped in blankets The mattress on the floor we now hold sacred You were my best friendWould you believe me if I said I was sorry The question wasn't mean to hurt It was just my fear of losing you And now you're filling all the space that surrounds you I'll soon be tucked away underneath your bed Where you gave yourself to me Where I gave myself to you Maybe it's all for the best But I just don't see any good in this, nooo Maybe we'll find something better But the lovers that leave us Will always hold the place Maybe it was wrong of me to think I could keep you And maybe it's the last few drinks Taking over my mouth and all I've been thinking I want you to know that I am fine here without you But I can't bring myself to lie to you And since we're being honest, I feel I should tell you I've been filling up the empty space between you and I Between you and I, she could never compare to you Between you and I, I still keep your pictures underneath my bed Where she gives herself to me Where I give myself to you
