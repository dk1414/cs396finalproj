Rosemary Heaven restores you in life You're coming with me Through the aging, the fearing, the strife It's the smiling on the package It's the faces in the sand It's the thought that moves you upwards Embracing me with two hands Right will take you places Yeah, maybe to the beach When your friends, they do come crying Tell them now your pleasure's set upon slow release Hey, wait Great smile Sensitive to fate, not Denial But hey, who's on trial It took a life span with no cell mate The long way back Sandy, why can't we look the other way I wish I could eat the salt off of your lost faded lips We can cap the old times, make playing only logical harm We can cap the old lines, make playing that nothing else will change But she can read, she can read, she can read, she can read She's bad She can read, she can read, she can read, she's bad Oh, she's bad But it's different now that I'm poor and aging I'll never see this face again You go stabbing yourself in the neck And we can find new ways of living Make playing only logical harm And we can top the old times Claim-making that nothing else will change But she can read, she can read, she can read, she can read She's bad She can read, she can read, she can read, she's bad Oh, she's badYours is the only version of my desertion That I could ever subscribe to That is all that I can do You are a past dinner, the last winner I'm raping all around me Until the last drop is behind you, oh And you're so cute when you're frustrated, dear Yeah, you're so cute when you're sedated, dear Oh, yes, dear Sleep tight, grim rite We have two hundred couches where you can Sleep tight, grim rite We have two hundred couches where you can Sleep tight, grim rite We have two hundred couches where you can Sleep tonight Sleep tonight Sleep tonight Sleep tonight You are the only person who's completely certain There's nothing here to be into That is all that you can do You are a past sinner, the last winner And everything we've come to It makes you you, youThis one's called "Stella Was a Diver and She's Always Down"When she walks down the street She knows there's people watching The building fronts are just fronts To hide the people watching her But she once fell through the street Down a manhole in that bad way The underground drip Was just like her scuba days Days Daze Days Daze She was all right 'cause the sea was so airtight, she broke away She was all right 'cause the sea was so airtight, she broke away She was all right but she can't come out tonight, she broke away She was all right 'cause the sea was so tight, airtight She broke away, broke away She broke away, broke away She broke away, broke away She broke awayI want your silent parts, the parts the birds love I know there's such a place I had my back turned, you didn't realize I'm lonely You lack the things to which I relate But I see no harm Come wait, come wait, come wait It's over Yeah, one, two, three, do me When I'm feeling lazy, it's probably because I'm saving all my energy to pick up when you move into My airspace Move into my airspace And something's coming over me, I see you in the doorway I can't control the part of me that swells up when you move into My airspace Move into my airspace But each night, I bury my love around you Oh, each night, I bury my love around you You're linked to my innocenceShe says it helps with the lights out Her rabid glow is like braille to the night She swears I'm a slave to the details But if your life is such a big joke, why should I care The clock is set for nine but you know you're gonna make it eight So that you two can take some time, teach each other to reciprocate She feels that my sentimental side should be held with kids' gloves But she doesn't know that I left my urge in the icebox She swears I'm just prey for the female Well then hook me up and throw me, baby cakes, 'cause I like to get hooked The clock is set for nine but you know you're gonna make it eight All the people that you've loved, they're all bound to leave some keepsakes I've been swinging all the time, think it's time I learned your way I picture you and me together in the jungle, it would be okay I'll bring you when my lifeboat sails through the night That is supposing that you don't sleep tonight It's like learning a new language Helps me catch up on my mime If you don't bring up those lonely parts This could be a good time It's like learning a new language You come here to me We'll collect those lonely parts and set them down You come here to meI haven't slept for two days I've bathed in nothing but sweat And I've made hallways scenes for things to regret My friends they come And the lines they go by Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry I live my life filled with no pain Just some rage and three kinds of yes And I've made stairways such scenes for things that I regret Oh, those days in the sun They bring a tear to my eye Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry But you're so young You're so young You look in my eyes You're so young, so sweet, so surprisedI had seven faces Thought I knew which one to wear But I'm sick of spending these lonely nights Training myself not to care The subway is a porno Pavements, they are a mess I know you've supported me for a long time Somehow, I'm not impressed But New York cares New York cares New York cares New York cares Subway, she is a porno And the pavements, they are a mess I know you've supported me for a long time Somehow, I'm not impressed It's up to me now, turn on the bright lights Oh, it's up to me now, turn on the bright lightsWhen she went, "hey love come over"My head abounds Oh, the feeling And she wept "hold me again", I made no sound Oh, the beating And she swore love is never done So easily And we went over again, my head abounds Oh, the feeling She said you don't need time Be tame, you won't meet your mate inside My faith won't lie He said you don't need mine Behave, you wanna leave my lady lovers Of my eighteen summers alone She said, you don't read minds Be patient, you won't leave me shaking Leave me shaking I keep falling, maybe half the time, maybe half the time I keep falling, maybe half the time, maybe half the time But it's all the rage back home It's all the rage back homeRosemary Heaven restores you in life You're
