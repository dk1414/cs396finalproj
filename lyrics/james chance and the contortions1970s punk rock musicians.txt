It's better than pleasure, it hurts more than pain But I've got what it takes to drive you insane Now is the time to lose all control Distort your body, oh, twist your soul, oh Contort yourself, oh, contort yourself Hey, baby, you better twist it, oh You'll never, never, never resist it Contort yourself, contort yourself, oh Hey, baby, don't you stick together and one of you just fall apart You better try bein' stupid, oh, instead of smart And once you take out all the garbage that's in your brain Forget about your future 'cause it's just, just, just, just too tame, oh Contort yourself, oh Oh, I said you got to I said you got to, you got to, you got to You got to contort yourself, oh Oh At first, you arrive in position and then you shatter your frame And then you stretch your resistance until your mind slips away And once you forget your affection for the human race Reduce yourself to zero and, baby, then you'll fall right in place, ohI stumbled into an empty trap I said I'm gonna cut you off With just one way, a slap I got no need to tell you Just how it feels All I want from you Is to give up what you steal You got nothing to show And you know it You're made of all I hate I can taste it I can't hurt you enough But do you feel it You're useless Ain't got no excuses You're designed to kill All that screaming's gonna rub off on you They're gonna strip you raw And beat you for your And I don't care what weapons you use Just as long as you keep me amusedI don't wanna be happy I said I like living a lie The bright brittle smiles Are gleaming and white About their colourless crime I could break them in two with the glint of my eye I don't want you to know me Unless you are shallow or sly When choosing my friends I always depend on them Like charades in disguise Once I figure them out they're a waste of my time I only live on the surface I don't think people are very pretty inside And my idea of fun Isn't having a son Or being whipped on the back of my thighs I prefer the ridiculous to the sublimeSick of being on the losing end I'm tired, I'm tired of playing the obliging friend Extort, extort my emotions all you like I'll lap it all, I'll lap it all up and I'll spit it right back I wanna dish it out!Ow  Want your heart for casual wear Want you to grasp at my straws And see if I care I said, I, I, I wanna see some emotion Not the usual fluff I wanna be the one to tell you When to start and when you've had enough Dish it out!I am a hopeless case I've failed every test And just like that, I got no sales resistance Now you got me obsessed I'll preserve you now And pay you back later I want to cramp your style, crocodile See you later, see you later alligatorCan't tell the difference between the face And your infection I'm running out You're sinkin' in, be my reflection I love to tremble, these are my membranes Let me inject ya around your throat Inside your eyes then I'll inspect ya Can't stand myself, throw me away Oh well, my emotions, it made me alter It deflates my passion, my hungry worship Is just one more shackle you can't fasten It better absorb me while I transmit Expletive spasms before you tumble In blind abandon into my castle Can't stand myself, throw me awayMy infatuation Dry intoxication You just come near me when you're asleep Pretend I'm not true Deceive you When I reel you You're only me Subconscious treasure Unconscious pleasure Wondrous sensation Pale creation My amputation My assassination My infatuationYou are the Marquis de Sade You want your guns to go pop You want your hot boys and chocolate centres I can't, no I won't I love to talk So if you want me to walk you better find the spot that's not tender I'm not a bedroom athlete Baby I'm not toilet trained I need to put you out I need to be restrained If you want quick service You better use a pump If you like hard wood You better better, ah, you better use a stump Hit me Girl you're polished to a high gloss You want someone to play boss You want to tell me what orders to give you I can't wear your disguise I'm too over-officialised I won't be your slave unless you will be mineTighten my skin I freeze inside Don't you dare let me melt You better caress my pride I'm under glass Stare if you please You better behave Wait at my ease You can bite me But not delight me I've known of all What you call love I'm all dressed up For you to carve You better eat all you like I'd rather starveBetter take what you can I got a roving eye You can't leave me wet I said you better wring me dry And baby do you think I made it with my most size You better do what you what you're told You better just get wise Roving eye And you're oh so dissolute Don't you be so flattered if I think you're cute There's only one of me There's a million of you If you can't fake it I said anyone else will do Roving eye I don't trust my intuition I don't place any bets Don't ask nothing from no one My feelings never connect I don't believe in a better world Baby I'm stuck with you Cause I'd rather take my turnI've been washed out and left to dry There's nothing left for you to buy I only want what's dry and smooth I only like things twice removed I devoured you before but I've gone sour You want more, I blame my nerves I'm a lot but I deserve what I got So you better hold me at bay Erase me for another day And when it's time to send me home I'll drain your eyes and claim your bones
