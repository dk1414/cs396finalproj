corpo moreno Cheiroso e gostoso que você temÉ um corpo delgado Da cor do pecado que faz tão bem Esse beijo molhado, escandalizado Que você me deu Tem sabor diferente Que a boca da gente jamais

moreno, moreno enlouquece E eu não sei bem porque Só sinto na vida o que vem de você Esse corpo moreno Cheiroso e gostoso que você temÉ um corpo delgado Da cor do pecado que faz tão bem Esse beijo molhado, escandalizado Que você me deu Tem sabor diferente Que a boca da gente jamais esqueceu Tem sabor diferente Que a boca da gente jamais esqueceuI wanna talk that body language Hey!Bass  Bass!I
