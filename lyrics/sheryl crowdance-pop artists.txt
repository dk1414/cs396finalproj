I've been long, a long way from here Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes And drank 'til I was thirsty again We went searchin' through thrift store jungles Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo And Benny Goodman's corset and pen Well, okay, I made this up I promised you I'd never give up If it makes you happy It can't be that bad If it makes you happy Then why the hell are you so sad You get down, real low down You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train Well, who hasn't been there before I come 'round, around the hard way Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread And serve you French toast againMy friend the communist Holds meetings in his R VI can't afford his gas So I'm stuck here watching T VI don't have digital I don't have diddly-squat It's not having what you want It's wanting what you've got I'm gonna soak up the sun I'm gonna tell everyone to lighten up I'm gonna tell 'em that I've got no one to blame For every time I feel lame, I'm lookin' up I'm gonna soak up the sun I'm gonna soak up the sun I've got a crummy job It don't pay near enough To buy the things it'd take To win me some of your loveHit it This ain't no disco It ain't no country club either This is L A"All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die"Says the man next to me, out of nowhere It's apropos of nothing He says his name is William But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy And he's plain ugly to me And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday In a bar that faces a giant car wash The good people of the world Are washing their cars on their lunch break Hosin' and scrubbin' as best they can in skirts and suits They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks Back to the phone company, the record store too Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, 'cause All I wanna do is have some fun I got a feelin' I'm not the only one All I wanna do is have some fun I got a feelin' I'm not the only one All I wanna do is have some fun Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica BoulevardThis is an open letter From you and me together Tomorrow's in our hands now Find the words that matter Say them out loud And make it better somehow Looking down from up on the moon It's a tiny blue marble Who would've thought the ground we stand on Could be so fragile This is a love song to the Earth You're no ordinary world A diamond in the universe Heaven's poetry to us Keep it safe, keep it safe, keep it safe Cause it's our world, it's our world It's not about possessions Money, or religion How many years we might live When the only real question that matters Is still a matter of perspectiveI'm American made, Bud Light, Chevrolet My mama taught me wrong from right I was born in the South Sometimes I have a big mouth When I see somethin' that I don't like I gotta say it Well, we've been driving this road for a mighty long time Payin' no mind to the signs Well, this neighborhood's changed It's all been rearranged We left that dream somewhere behind Slow down, you're gonna crash Baby, you were screaming, it's a blast, blast, blast Look out, babe, you've got your blinders on Everybody's lookin' for a way to get real gone Real gone Real gone But there's a new cat in town He's got high paid friends Thinks he's gonna change history You think you know him so well Yeah, you think he's so swell But he's just perpetuatin' prophecyI hitched a ride with a vending machine repair man He said he's been down this road more than twice He was high on intellectualism I've never been there, but the brochure looks nice Jump in, let's go Lay back, enjoy the show Everybody gets high, everybody gets low These are the days when anything goes Everyday is a winding road I get a little bit closer Everyday is a faded sign I get a little bit closer to feeling fine He's got a daughter he calls Easter She was born on a Tuesday night I'm just wondering why I feel so all alone Why I'm a stranger in my own life Jump in, let's go Lay back, enjoy the show Everybody gets high, everybody gets low These are the days when anything goesOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh I woke up and called this morning The tone of your voice was a warning That you don't care for me anymore I made up the bed we sleep in I looked at the clock when you creep in It's 6 a.m., and I'm alone Did you know when you go, it's the perfect ending To the bad day I was just beginning When you go all I know is You're my favorite mistake Your friends are sorry for me They watch you pretend to adore me But I'm no fool to this game Now here comes your secret lover She'd be unlike any other Until your guilt goes up in flamesTen years livin' in a paper bag Feedback, baby, he's a flipped out cat He's a platinum canary, drinkin' Falstaff beer Mercedes Ruehl and a rented Lear Bottom feeder, insincere Prophet lo-fi pioneer Sell the house and go to school Get a young girlfriend, daddy's jewel A change Would do you good I think a change Would do you good God's little gift is on the rag Poster girl posin' in a fashion mag Canine, feline, Jekyll and Hyde You wear your fake fur on the inside Queen of South Beach, aging blues Dinner's at six, wear your cement shoes I thought you were singin' your heart out to me Your lips were syncing and now I seeGod, I feel like hell tonight Tears of rage I cannot lie I'd be the last to help you understand Are you strong enough to be my man My man Nothing's true and nothing's right So let me be alone tonight'Cause you can't change the way I am Are you strong enough to be my man Lie to me I promise I'll believe Lie to me But please don't leave Don't leave I have a face I cannot show I make the rules up as I go Just try and love me if you can Are you strong enough to be my man My manI would've given you all of my heart But there's someone who's torn it apart And he's taken just all that I have But if you want, I'll try to love again Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know The first cut is the deepest Baby, I know The first cut is the deepest But when it comes to being lucky, he's cursed When it comes to lovin' me, he's worst I still want you by my side Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried And I'm sure gonna give you a try If you want, I'll try to love again, try Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know, oh The first cut is the deepest Baby, I know The first cut is the deepest But when it comes to being lucky, he's cursed And when it comes to lovin' me, he's worst
