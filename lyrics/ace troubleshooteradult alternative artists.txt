it all Squalor, impulse, crowding, tis the season Do the days turn just for these Savior born in manger Please forgive us born in the Inn Heaven tomorrow Heaven, my chance to have it all See all my glimmering weakness Here's my world, come on will You come in Brought to my knees Child I'll play for You Child enters in this world, it's broken Angels sing and men sleep the night Though it's brazen and defiant Please be born in my heartHere I go against the grain It's time to yet again complain And make some noise Make some noise We've got all our sciences Making our appliances To dull the pain It's Novacaine for the soul Hollywood, pop culture's best You do no good, you vultures' nest And I want out I want out It's gambling now, the more you wait And think that you can have your Kate And Edith, too And so to lose your own soul I'll call your bluff, I've had enough Oh-no, Ho-Jo So is it fantasy or is it reality t.v.?So here's your world condoned You get the chisel I'l get the stoneI know I told you But I dole out excuses I'll get home just as soon as I can It'll be alright But I mean it, gotta believe it You're still my daylight and my evening, girl And I'll see you tonight A Sunday drive, girl let's get out tonight Yeah the tunes on the stereo Make me wish I was home I'm feeling like a leg is missing Its ball & chain Yeah the tunes on the stereo Make me wish I was home And it seems cliche to love you For hating me being away from you If I said it, would you regret it Knowing I'll want you more Every day we're apart But we'll be just fine So I'm jealous of the fellas Who get close enough To share the air you breathe But tonight you're all me A Sunday drive, girl let's get out tonightGone away, gone away forever Not to come back home I did stay all the night through with you Without knowing you'd gone Without time for the world to breathe on The changing dust it woke Glimpses of all the life you poured out Till the vessel broke Don't know if I'll see you When it's my turn to come home Don't know if I'll see you But I hope so, but I hope so Parting now at our own Grey Havens The words you left the debris So be still, knowing that He'll see you across the Sea Don't know if I'll see you When it's my turn to come home Don't know if I'll see you But I hope so, but I hope so To be woken from the long sleep Of this world's nightEvery time I try to make it happen I just fake it I think it's over And I blink, it's over Every time I screw up I never let up And I keep forgetting to think it over'cause I blink, it's over Every time I close my eyes I sit there hoping You go on holding my hand in Yours So stay, yeah stay forever Every day it's getting colder And I find I'm getting older Need warmer climes now Need a land with warming sun And a heart whose every beat is one That keeps Your time Keeps Your time somehow Every time I close my eyes I sit there hoping You go on holding my hand in Yours So stay, yeah stay foreverTonight I can't sleep Because of all the thoughts I keep Running around inside my brain Sweet memories come back Yeah thoughts of you attack my head Making me go so insane In my dreams you are there And in my dreams we are a pair Why did it have to turn out this way In my thoughts you are there And in my every thought you care The look of love in your eyes, I'll stay Remembering you and all the little things you do So I look away and I fake a smile Waiting for a sign, wishing I could drop a line I'm missing you, it's been a while A brand new page, a whole clean slate It's too bad it's without you- -and the smile that I wore is gone, you shut the door A friend, but I'll always want more, I'll always want more So now I just hope that the world is treating you fine And I hope your memories are sweet as mine Goodbye's are hardFourteen hours a day, fourteen days in two weeks A fortnight out to sea, I'm far from home, alright by me Off the coast of Japan, then the Ivory Keys I put my back into my distancing the distant seas I'll sail away, I'll sail away forever and forever Hoist the jig, skip the rope, do whatever you do To get me into the blue Alright by me Hey mamasita, ain't it great Ain't it wonderful Hey mamasita, ain't it great When you're worlds away Getting further away, putting distance between Myself and all the shelves of smarmy, charmy human creeps Interruptions are gone, lost in a reverie Nothing but wind, waves, and inspiration for my peeps I'll sail away, I'll sail away forever and forever Hoist the jig, skip the rope, do whatever you do To get me into the blue Alright by me Hey mamasita, ain't it great Ain't it wonderful Hey mamasita, ain't it great When you're worlds away I don't want to feel this way But I know with every step I take or move I make He's staring me right in the face, get out of my way!I don't want to feel this way Tearing me apart inside, I know I can't hide Takes me for a ride, he's quite the lie Tapeworm"I don't care if it's your way"That's the anthem of the thing I love to hate"I don't care if it's your way"Feeding me toxins Though I'm boxed in I know I can't trust him Tapeworm Smooth and slippery Full of frippery Full of ballyhoo I hate you!Na na na na na na na Hate the tapeworm It has been way too long since back when Jasmine I've been wrong I've been wrong about nothing You're still the same, I wish you changed It's still your game by your rules And I will never learn nothing And nothing ever changes You're asking me to go to an ordinary, satisfactory Almost paradise Staying round you Hanging round you Jasmine With the sound of our straws Sipping down Yoohoo You tantalize, I fantasize And in your eyes is the world When all else fades into nothing I'm the proof you're beautiful When you're aloof I get dumb And I can't think about nothing else And nothing ever changes You're asking me to go to an ordinary, satisfactory Almost paradise
