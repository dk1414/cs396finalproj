better that way The eyes narrowed down Behind Saigon Mirror shades Reflect the death of the sun And nothing more to say Drowned in blood radiation As it fades and seeps away The night is comin'And it's filled with Dark Surprise Nights all oozin Like oil in the neon sky Tonight's the one We've waited all our livesCome on baby it's time to move You been saying there's nothing to do Don't be afraid of bustin' out of your cage Gonna cruise around gonna burn up the stage Do the Pop Come on baby I said squeeze the weez On your feet or on your knees So messed up I'm gonna do some dives Gonna

is getting low After sundown we'll be ready And who could ask for more On the third day of the seventh month Is when we'll ride the highway Night descends, daylight ends And like the light we'll fly
