With suspicious minds And we can't build our dreams On suspicious minds So if an old friend I know stops by to say hello Would I still see suspicion in your eyes Here we go again, asking where I've been You can't see the tears are real, I'm cryin' We can't go on together With suspicious minds And we can't build our dreams On suspicious minds Oh, let our love survive I'll dry the tears from your eyes Let's don't let a good thing die When, honey, you know I've never lied to you Mmm, yeah, yeahThere must be lights burning brighter somewhere Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue If I can dream of a better land, where all my brothers walk hand in hand Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true  Oh why There must be peace and understanding sometime Strong wind of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear If I can dream of a warmer sun, where hope keeps shining on everyone Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear We're lost in a cloud with too much rain We're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain But as long as a man has the strength to dream He can redeem his soul and fly Deep in my heart, there's a trembling question Still, I am sure that the answer's..  answer's gonna come somehow Out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle, yeah And while I can think, while I can talk, while I can stand, while I can walk While I can dream, oh, please let my dream come true, oh, right now Let it come true right now Oh, yeahWell, since my baby left me Well, I found a new place to dwell Well, it's down at the end of Lonely Street At Heartbreak Hotel Where I'll be, I'll be so lonely, baby Well, I'm so lonely I'll be so lonely, I could die Although it's always crowded You still can find some room For broken-hearted lovers To cry there in their gloom They'll be, they'll be so lonely, baby They'll be so lonely They're so lonely, they could die Now, the bellhop's tears keep flowin'And the desk clerk's dressed in black Well, they've been so long on Lonely Street They'll never, never look backAre you lonesome tonight  Do you miss me tonight Are you sorry we drifted apart Does your memory stray to a brighter summer day When I kissed you and called you sweetheart Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there Is your heart filled with pain  Shall I come back again Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight I wonder if you are lonesome tonight You know someone said that the world's a stage and each must play a part Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart Act one was where we met I loved you at first glance You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue Then came act two You seemed to change, you acted strange And why, I've never known Honey, you lied when you said you loved me And I had no cause to doubt you But I'd rather go on hearing your lies Than to go on living without you Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there With emptiness all around And if you won't come back to me Then they can bring the curtain downWell, it's one for the money, two for the show Three to get ready, now go, cat, go But don't you step on my blue suede shoes Well, you can do anything, but stay off of my blue suede shoes Well, you can knock me down, step in my face Slander my name all over the place Do anything that you wanna do But uh-uh honey, lay off of them shoes And don't you step on my blue suede shoes Well, you can do anything, but stay off of my blue suede shoes Let's go, cat!Ah, walk the dog You can burn my house, steal my car Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar Do anything that you want to do But uh-uh, honey, lay off of my shoesWise men say"Only fools rush in"But I can't help Falling in love with you Shall I stay Would it be a sin If I
