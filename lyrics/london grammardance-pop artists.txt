You crossed this line Do you find it hard to sit with me tonight I've walked these miles, but I've walked them straight lined You'll never know what it's like to be Fine And I'm wasting my young years It doesn't matter if I'm chasing old ideas It doesn't matter if, maybe, we are, we are Maybe I'm wasting my young years Maybe, we are, we are Maybe I'm wasting my young years Don't you know that it's only fear And I wouldn't worry, you have all your life I've heard it takes some time to get it right I'm wasting my young years It doesn't matter if I'm chasing old ideas It doesn't matter if, maybe, we are, we are Maybe I'm wasting my young years Maybe, we are, we are Maybe I'm wasting my young yearsLet winter break Let it burn 'til I see you again I will be here with you Just like I told you I would I'd love to always love you But I'm scared of loneliness When I'm, when I'm alone with you I know it's hard Only you and I Is it all for me Because I know it's all for you And I guess, I guess It is hell and, you are the only thing I've ever truly known So, I hesitate, if I can act the same for you And my darlin', I'll be rooting for you And my darlin', I'll be rooting for you And where did she go Truth left us long ago And I need her tonight because I'm scared of loneliness with you, baby And I should let it go But all that is left is my perspective, broken and so left behind againHey now, letters burning by my bed for you Hey now, I can feel my instincts here for you Hey now, by my bed for you Hey now, hey now Oh, you know it is frightening Oh, you know it’s like lightning Hey now, now Hey now, letters burning by my bed for you Hey now, leave it to the wayside like you do For you, imagination calling mirrors for you Hey now, hey now Oh, you know it is frightening Oh, you know it’s like lightning Hey now, now, hey now, now Hey now, now, hey now, nowExcuse me for a while While I'm wide eyed and I'm so damn caught in the middle I've excused you for a while While I'm wide eyed and I'm so damn caught in the middle And if a lion, a lion, roars, would you not listen If a child, a child cries, would you not forgive them Yeah, and man seems so strong Yeah, man speak so long Man never been so wrong Yeah, and man seem so strong Yeah, man speak so long Man never been so wrong Excuse me for a while Turn a blind eye with a stare caught right in the middle Have you wondered for a while I have a feeling deep down you're caught in the middle And if a lion, a lion, roars, would you not listen If a child, a child cries, would you not forgive them Love, what did you do to me My only hope is to let life stretch out before me And break me on this lonely road I'm made of many things, but I'm not what you are made of Only now do I see the big picture But I swear that these scars are fine Only you could've hurt me in this perfect way tonight I might be blind, but you've told me the difference Between mistakes and what you just meant for me Don't say you ever loved me Don't say you ever cared My darkest friend Words Have you forgotten all the lies you left there so fresh Turning old in the air And now, you have no weapons You can try to get close to those I love Do you really think they don't know what you're made ofI'm giving you a nightcall to tell you how I feel I'm gonna drive you through the night, down the hills I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear I'm gonna show you where it's dumped, but have no fear There's something inside you It's hard to explain There's something inside you, boy And you're still the same I'm giving you a nightcall to tell you how I feel I'm gonna drive you through the night, down the hills I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear I'm gonna show you where it’s dumped, but have no fear There's something inside you It's hard to explain They're talking about you, boy But you're still the same And I'll tell you Tell you how Tell you how Tell you howMiles and miles on my own Warm with shame, I follow on A language to find hard to hear Not to understand, just disappear To hold your heart, to hold your hand Would be to me, the greatest thing To hold your heart, hold your hand Would be to me, the bravest thing Could you take my place and stand here I do not think you'd take this pain You'll be on your knees and struggle under the weight Oh, the truth would be a beautiful thing Oh, the truth is a beautiful thing I wear another thought of you There's so much home I give to you Hide you somewhere they don't know Deep in my call you know you have a throne Hold your heart, hold your hand Would be to me, the greatest thing To hold your heart, to hold your hand Would be to me, the bravest thingI can see that you're giving up It should not mean that much to me And I don't know where the rest go But everybody's been telling me no But I'll always have a thing for you I'd move the earth But nothing made you want me better There is nothing I can do But steal the moon But nothing made you want me better Oh woman, oh man Choose a path or a child Great mirrored plans Oh woman, oh man Take a devil by the hands through Yellow sands And I can see that you're giving up So tell me it should not mean this much to me And I don't know where the rest goes Everybody's been telling me noWe both know that you wanna love her Skies are open crying, please don't believe her'Cause she'll tell you lies and then say it doesn't matter And you're pleased to see her calling them non-believers But maybe she loves you and I'm just a preacher Those burning skies and all who don't believe her Non-believers, no Don't believe her, no All that we are, all that we need They're different things Oh, maybe what we are and what we need They're different things Do you realise again, you chased an idea Heels and earth behind some broken creature Maybe she loves you and I'm just a preacher Non-believers crying "don't believe her"Don't believe her, no Don't believe her, noLove All these lights are changing, see them everywhere In my veins like lightning, I don't even care And the crowd is heavy, I don't wanna move All these colours in me, but all I see is you And nothing else matters You, baby, it's you You, baby, it's you You, baby, it's you You, baby, it's you All these painted faces singing back to me There's an ocean here, but you are all I see And nothing else matters You, baby, it's you You, baby, it's you You, baby, it's you You, baby, it's you You, baby, it's you You, baby, it's you You, baby, it's you Baby, it's you, baby, it's you
