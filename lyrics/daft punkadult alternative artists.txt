Like the legend of the phoenix, huh All ends with beginnings What keeps the planet spinning, uh-huh The force from the beginning Look We've come too far To give up who we are So let's raise the bar And our cups to the stars She's up all night 'til the sun I'm up all night to get some She's up all night for good fun I'm up all night to get lucky We're up all night 'til the sun We're up all night to get some We're up all night for good fun We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get luckyI didn't want to be the one to forget I thought of everything I'd never regret A little time with you is all that I get That's all we need because it's all we can take One thing I never see the same when you're 'round I don’t believe in him, his lips on the ground I wanna take you to that place in the Roche But no one gives us any time anymore He asks me once if I'd look in on his dog You made an offer for it, then you ran off I got this picture of us kids in my head And all I hear is the last thing that you said"I listened to your problems, now listen to mine"I didn't want to anymore, oh-oh-oh And we will never be alone again'Cause it doesn't happen every day Kinda counted on you being a friend Can I give it up or give it away Now I thought about what I wanna say But I never really know where to go So I chained myself to a friend'Cause I know it unlocks like a door And we will never be alone again'Cause it doesn't happen every day Kinda counted on you being a friend Can I give it up or give it away Now I thought about what I wanna say But I never really know where to go So I chained myself to a friend Some more againTouch, touch I remember touch Touch, touch I remember touch Where do I belong Touch, I need something more I remember touch I need something more in my mind Touch, I remember touch Pictures came with touch A painter in my mind Tell me what you see A tourist in a dream A visitor, it seems A half-forgotten song Where do I belong Tell me what you see I need something more Kiss, suddenly alive Happiness arrive Hunger like a storm How do I begin A room within a room A door behind a door Touch, where do you lead I need something more Tell me what you see I need something moreWhen I was fifteen, sixteen, when I really started to play guitar I definitely wanted to become a musician It was almost impossible because—it was—the dream was so big That I didn't see any chance because I was living in a little town; was studying And when I finally broke away from school and became a musician I thought, "Well, now I may have a little bit of a chance"Because all I really wanted to do is music And not only play music, but compose music At that time, in Germany, in '69, '70, they had already discotheques So, I would take my car, would go to a discotheque Sing maybe thirty minutes I think I had about seven, eight songs I would partially sleep in the car Because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about Almost two years to survive in the beginning I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the '50s The sounds of the '60s, of the '70s And then have a sound of the future And I said, "Wait a second, I know the synthesizer Why don't I use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future "And I didn't have any idea what to do But I knew I needed a click, so we put a click on the 24-track Which then was synced to the Moog Modular I knew that could be a sound of the future But I didn't realize how much the impact would be My name is Giovanni Giorgio But everybody calls me GiorgioI know you don't get a chance to take a break this often I know your life is speedin' and it isn't stoppin'Here, take my shirt and just go ahead

Your home's a promise long forgotten It is the birthplace of your dreams
