I had the strangest dream You were lost at sea I found you drowning on the ocean floor I woke from my deep sleep to end the misery I found you lying outside of my door I tried to wake you up To shake you up And found out you were dead Like a leaf in the wind you left me standing alone To face the demons in my head We're making fiction of our lives Burning pages as we write We read the lies between the lines These dead letters won't survive A dusty record spins An old song plays again The needle drags across it's skin Ink spills through my pen The paper soaks it in The music bringing tremors to my hands I can't just give you up Just lift you up to chance on a dragon fly's wings With my love in the wind you left me standing alone Hoping it brings you back to meIt's a bone cold night I'm breathing in the air It's freezing up my lungs As I fight for words to share with you To tell you what you've done to me You ripped me from my set in stone complacency You rose from the ashes Like a phoenix with a heartache Now you're taking me away with you tonight And I know that I can't fly But when I'm in your arms, I'm holding up the sky It's a bone cold night I'm writhing in despair It's freezing up my heart As you fight for words to share with me To tell me what my eyes can't see You ripped me from my set in stone complacency You rose from the ashes Like a phoenix with a heartache Now you're taking me away with you tonight And I know that I can't fly But when I'm in your arms, I'm holding up the sky I'm holding up the skyI'm sick and tired of watching over you Never knowing what you're gonna do Every step you take is closer and closer to falling far away What's it gonna take, what's it take to make you see If it all came down tonight Safe from the losing fight Just know I only want to hear you say Hallelujah, hallelujah He's alive in me today Hallelujah, hallelujah He's alive in me today Everyday you search for something new You turn your back on things that make you choose And every time you do, you're closer and closer to falling far away What's it gonna take, what's it take to make you see If it all came down tonight Safe from the losing fight Just know I only want to hear you sayYour words are shallow and dull against my skin Their cold bitter edge cuts deeper within I don't appreciate the words you say behind my back, but it's okay I'm not one for getting mad And I don't need apologies I don't fall for sympathy You can't win me back This will be the last time I'm kissing you goodbye You left me with a scar across my back These stones are breaking my bones as they crush me Your careless remarks left me here to bleed I don't appreciate the games you play without regret but it's okay I'm not one for getting mad And I don't need apologies I don't fall for sympathy You can't win me back This will be the last time I'm kissing you goodbye You left me with a scar across my back Across my backCan you feel the beat of a thousand marching feet Searching for passion in a lifeless dead-end street They're breaking down the wall They're knocking at the door Searching for a soul that gives them more When the music dies, the apparitions of melody will rise All that's said and done, will haunt us one by one The spirit of the heart will carry on Are you listening to the voices as they scream Calling to the masses with the drone of sleepless dreams They're coming to your house They're crawling up the stairs Searching for a saint who really cares When the music dies, the apparitions of melody will rise All that's said and done, will haunt us one by one The spirit of the heart will carry on Will carry It's just below the skin, that it starts sinking inI never meant to hurt you I never thought my words could cut right through Leaving open wounds In all this open space, I took myself into a place I never should have gone, I never should have gone Oh, the damage is done Lay me down in fields of green This heart has seen things I never should have seen You're breaking my legs and teaching me I never saw my own pride I never thought my lips could taste of lies And kiss your crying eyes And all the scars you've gained, from crimson covered hands That held your face when they were strong My hands used to be so strong Oh, the damage they've done Lay me down in fields of green This heart has seen things I never should have seen You're breaking my legs and teaching meThere's a burning in my heart everyday I come to you, I look to you and say When will I become everything that you've intended me to be I'm beating at my chest everyday I run to you, I come to you and say When will I become everything that you've intended me to be I am so tired, I am so beaten From walking down this road of shattered dreams I am so lonely, I am so broken Won't you come, won't you rescue me Won't you rescue me I am so tired, I am so tired, I am so tired, I am so tired I am so tired, I am so beaten From walking down this road of shattered dreams I am so lonely, I am so broken Won't you come, come rescue me Come rescue me Won't you come, won't you come I'm calling out your name I'm calling out your name I'm calling out your name I'm calling out your name I am so tired, I am so broken And won't you come, won't you come I am so lonely, I am so broken And won't you come, won't you come Won't you come Won't you come You rescue me Come to you, look to you and singCrowded streets and the memories of all the faces you see You don't know who I am when you're looking at me Hang me tonight in the false and jaded light In the center of the square, murder's breeding in the air We're all innocent The shadow's playing with our eyes It's playing with our eyes Sharpened tongues and the loaded guns of all the fortunate sons You're the jack, back in black, ripping air from our lungs Hang me tonight in the false and jaded light In the center of the square, murder's breeding in the air We're all innocent The shadow's playing with our eyes The shadow's playing with our eyes The shadow's playing I'd cut my heart out of my chest and attach it to my sleeve If I thought you'd think differently of me I'd cut my heart out of my chest and attach it to my sleeve If I thought you'd think differentlyMy knuckles have turned white, from holding your hand oh so tight Your hand in mine feels too right My tongue has become tied, I'm fighting back my insides I'm dancing with an angel under pale moonlight I'm waiting for the day when you will come to me and say I'm here to stay so let's run away We are standing on the edge of it all Take my hand let's go There's no need to be afraid of the fall My love will hold you I'm drying tears I've cried, from finding love that's in your eyes One kiss from you and I'm paralyzed Our hearts are killing time, they're dying to be in line The idea of being one with you is the greatest prize We'll watch each other grow, and step into the great unknown This is our hope, the seed we've sown We are standing on the edge of it all Take my hand let's go There's no need to be afraid of the fall My love will hold youLove, is it all that you want Is it everything you hope for Love, is it more than the word That you use when you look at her Love, it'll push you around It'll make you a poor man Change your picture of heaven, heaven Love, it'll make you a man It'll make you a child again And love, does it keep you awake Does it change everything you see And love, is it worth what you give Is it everything you need Love, it'll push you around It'll make you a poor man Change your picture of heaven, heaven Love, it'll make you a man It'll make you a child again
