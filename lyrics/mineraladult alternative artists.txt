I wouldn't mind if you took me in my sleep tonight I wouldn't even put up a fight I wouldn't care if you took it all away today I'm sure I wouldn't even miss the pain But I know I've got to live my life And roll around on the ground and feel the strife And realize along the way that I'm nothing more than A grain of salt in the salt of the earth, and everything is grace So come on with the darkness Come on with the fear Cause I've got to start somewhere And it might as well be here And when I'm finally naked and standing in the sunlight I'll look back at all this selfishness and foolish pride And laugh at myself, laugh at myself Laugh at myself, laugh at myself Laugh at myselfA brave morning, thoughts flap their wings and fly And I can still taste defeat on my lips Bright tie, fish fly, I have not yet arrived How can I not admit, I need to know you'Cause I just want to be something more than the mud in your eyes I want to be the clay in your hands Hey sorrow, where are you Tomorrow just won't be the same without you here I'll wish for shoulders bold and broad to bear And strength to hold my head above them'Cause I just want to be something more than the mud in your eyes I want to be the clay in your hands'Cause Gloria is silent, Gloria is silent Gloria is silent and glory is a silent thingSummer unfolded like a tapestry And you were there as you have always been There glowing where the sky meets with the trees Air softly crowing, singing fears to sleep Will you ever know how much I love you for that Will you ever know how much I love you I wish you could put your ear up to my heart And hear how much I love you I wish you could put your ear up to my heart And hear how much I love you I still dream of December Dancing together With rings on our fingers And the two shall become And the two shall become, becomeThere I was, fourteen spinning With my arms out like a scarecrow Walking down Monroe to the park Dancing up Madison With my eyes closed Your feet sounding like a symphony of strings You picked me up and whispered "Forever"Like a secret in my ears, nowThe humble and righteous and meek Are teaching me whose will to seek But who really knows how to speak About these things Questions of where can he go When he is feeling so low And kicking himself just to show How he still bleeds And I want to know The difference between What sparkles And what is gold I wonder how many eyes Are fixed like a vulture's on me now I wonder if I can even move or breathe Without disappointing someone And I know what they call themselves But I don't remember inviting them To put me on this pedestal and make me feel so naked Afraid to look down, afraid to turn aroundShe stepped outside into the morning air To watch the cars go by and let the sun dry her hair I wanted to tell her how beautiful she was But I just stared I sat behind the wheel and watched the raindrops As they gathered on the windshield And raced down into the humming motor And she folded up her fears like paper airplanes And lost them in the trees And I know I don't deserve this The capacity to feel To laugh and to cry and to praise For that I live and breathe and wake each day Is nothing less than your grace In awkward and glorious movementIt's been so long since I've been by myself And I need this more than you will ever know People like you and me never feel the breeze People like you and me will never know the easy way I scream into the wind and laugh As the words slap me in the face I would gladly trade a lifetime of convenience For an honest day or two It's just not the same when you're staring Into a perfect golden sunset And thinking about how you sold your soul To send the rain away It's been so long since I've stood on my two feet I'd really rather lay here and pretend But people like you and me never get that peace It comes from denying that everything is so screwed up It's so screwed up I stand on a building and throw Up my arms to the sky I swallow my pride and admit that it's not always best To understand the reasons why It's just not the same when you wake up in the morning With a smile on your face When you know you lied yourself to sleep To make it betterWill you come and what will I say Oh, I have been so distant and unhappy Like I could disappear When I was a boy I saw things That no one else could see So why am I so blind, at twenty-two, to the hope That is all around me, filling up this room On the road on my own Waiting for the words to fall from your tongue Into my ears When I was a boy, I could hear Symphonies in seashells So why am I so deaf, at twenty-two, to the sound Of the driving snow that drives me home to you To the sound, to the sound To the sound To the sound, to the sound To the sound To the sound, to the sound To the sound To the sound, to the sound To the soundI wouldn't mind if you took me in my sleep tonight I wouldn't even put up a fight I wouldn't care if you took it all away today I'm sure I wouldn't even miss the pain But I know I've got to live my life And roll around on the ground and feel the strife And realize along the way that I'm nothing more than A grain of salt in the salt of the earth, and everything is grace So come on with the darkness Come on with the fear Cause I've got to start somewhere And it might as well be here And when I'm finally naked and standing in the sunlight I'll look back at all this selfishness and foolish pride And laugh at myself, laugh at myself Laugh at myself, laugh at myself Laugh at myself
