Chip: 7 ADavy: What number is this, Chip Other 3 Monkees: 7-A!Davy: O K!, know what I mean, like don't get excited man  It's 'cos I'm short, I know Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings Of the bluebird as she sings The six o'clock alarm would never ring But it rings and I rise Wipe the sleep out of my eyes My shavin' razor's cold and it stings Cheer up, sleepy Jean Oh, what can it mean To a daydream believer And a homecoming queen You once thought of me As a white knight on his steed Now you know how happy I can be Oh, and our good times starts and end Without dollar one to spend But how much, baby, do we really needI thought love was only true in fairy tales Meant for someone else, but not for me Love was out to get me That's the way it seemed Disappointment haunted all my dreams Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer Not a trace of doubt in my mind I'm in love I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried I thought love was more or less a givin' thing Seems the more I gave, the less I got What's the use in tryin'?All you get is pain When I needed sunshine, I got rain Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer Not a trace of doubt in my mind I'm in love I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried{Intro}She's a wonderful lady and she's mine, all mine And there doesn't seem a way that she won't come and lose my mind It's too easy humming songs to a girl in a yellow dress It's been a long time since the party and the room is in a mess The four kings of E MI are sitting stately on the floor There are birds out on the sidewalk and a valet at the door He reminds me of a penguin with few and plastered hair There's talcum powder on the letter and the birthday boy is there Why don't you cut your hair Why don't you live up there Why don't you do what I do See what I feel when I care Now they've darkened all the windows and the seats are Naugahyde I've been waiting for an hour, I can't find a place to hide The being known as Wonder Girl is speaking, I believe It's not easy trying to tell her that I shortly have to leaveThe local rock group down the street Is trying hard to learn this song They serenade the weekend squire Who just came out to mow his lawn Another Pleasant Valley Sunday Charcoal burning everywhere Rows of houses that are all the same And no one seems to care See Mrs  Gray she's proud today Because her roses are in bloom And Mr  Green he's so serene He's got a T V in every room Another Pleasant Valley Sunday Here in status symbol land Mothers complain about how hard life is And the kids just don't understand Creature comfort goals They only numb my soul And make it hard for me to see My thoughts all seem to stray To places far away I need a change of sceneryTake the last train to Clarksville And I'll meet you at the station You can be here by four thirty Cause I've made your reservation Don't be slow Oh, no, no, no Oh, no, no, no Cause I'm leaving in the morning And I must see you again We'll have one more night together Till the morning brings my train and I must go Oh, no, no, no Oh, no, no, no And I don't know if I'm ever coming home Take the last train to Clarksville I'll be waiting at the station We'll have time for coffee-flavored kisses And a bit of conversation, oh Oh, no, no, no Oh, no, no, noZilch!Mister Dobalina, Mister Bob Dobalina Mister Dobalina, Mister Bob Dobalina Mister Dobalina, Mister Bob

star Open your eyes, get up off your chair There's so much to do in the sunlight Give up your secrets and let down your hair And sit with me here by the firelight Why think all about who's gonna win out We'll make up our story as we go along There's so little time for us to try to rhyme And so many highways to travel upon Open your eyes, get up off your chair There's so much to do in the sunlight Give up your secrets and let down your hair And sit with me here by the firelightI-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone You're tryin' to make your mark in society You're usin' all the tricks that you used on me You're readin' all them high fashion magazines The clothes you're wearin', girl, they're causin' public scenes I said I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin'

have no shoes But now you're walkin' around like you're front page news You've been awful careful 'bout the friends you choose But you won't find my name in your book of who's who I said I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone No, girl, not me!I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone No Sock it to me...Floatin' down the river With a saturated liver And I wish I could forgive her But I do believe she meant it When she told me to forget it And I bet she will regret it When they find me in the morning wet and drowned And the word gets 'round Goin' down Goin' down Coming' up for air It's pretty stuffy under there I'd like to say I didn't care But I forgot to leave a note And it's so hard to stay afloat I'm soakin' wet without a boat And I knew I should have taken off my shoes It's front page news Goin' down Goin' down I wish I had another drink It wouldn't be so hard to sink I should have taken time to think Besides I got the picture straight She must have had another date I didn't need this extra weight I wish that I could see the way to shore Don't want no more Goin' down I'm goin' downMe and Magdalena We're driving south through Monterey As the sun is slowly sinking Into a distant ocean wave And I don't know if I've ever loved any other Half as much as I do in this light she's under Tell me Magdalena What do you see in the depths of your night Do you see a long lost father Does he hold you with the hands you remember as a child But know everything lost will be recovered When you drift into the arms of the undiscovered And I don't know if I've ever loved any other Half as much as I do in this light she's under Me and Magdalena Always leaving early and sleeping late Secluded in the canyon Lost within a turn of fate
