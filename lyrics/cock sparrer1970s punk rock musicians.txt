We're coming back We're coming back We're coming back to you We're never gonna go away again Hold on a little longer, try a little harder'til we're arm in arm together to the end So remember, out there somewhere you've got a friend And you'll never walk alone again Don't get worried Don't get scared We're fighting to get there Never doubt we're gonna get through We're gonna run We're gonna crawl Kick down every wall It won't be long we're coming back to you So remember, out there somewhere you've got a friend And you'll never walk alone againWe worked our way up from east end pubs To gigs and back stage passes Ex-boxing champs, West end clubs Americans in dark glasses Driving ten grand cars, they drink in hotel bars They're even making money in bed They wouldn't be no loss, they ain't worth a toss It's about time they all dropped dead Take 'em all, take 'em all Put 'em up against a wall and shoot 'em Short and tall, watch 'em fall Come on boys take 'em all Well tough shit boys, it weren't our fault Your record didn't make it We made you dance, you had your chance But you didn't take it Well, I gotta go make another deal Sign another group for the company I don't suppose we'll ever meet again You'd better get back to the factory Take 'em all, take 'em all Put 'em up against a wall and shoot 'em Short and tall, watch 'em fall Come on boys take 'em allIt can't be right what I'm reading here No one believes in all this stuff no more Our ideas don't see eye to eye Get your press with a pocketfull of lies Telling everybody every word is true One day soon they're gonna see through you I got your number, you can fool some people some part of the time I got your number, I ain't ever gonna toe that particular partyline There'll be some people gonna back you up But don't look here for moral support Don't you ask no favours from me I don't believe in charity Telling everybody you're wonderful What are you gonna do when there's no one left to tell it to I got your number, you can fool some people some part of the time I got your number, I ain't ever gonna toe that particular partyline You think you're so special, but you're only fooling Tell your lies to anyone but meI believed in Julie when she said how easy it could be And I believed in Tony and his written words of anarchy And I believed in Joe when he said we had to fight And I believed in Jimmy when he told us to unite Where are they now Where are they now Where are they, six years on and they've all gone Now it's all turned sour Where are they now Hollywood nights in Soho Writing on the wall of The Roxy loo Rotten on the telly Showing what a few choice words can do Was it ever worth it Causing all the fuss You know, I believed in them Don't you believe in us No more kids are innocent We will get fooled again Only faces ever change The song remains the sameEverybody's talking bout' revolution Everybody's talking bout' smash the state Sounds to me like a bum solution Right wing, left wing full of hate We don't wanna fight'Cause you tell us to So watch your back when you attack'Cause we might just turn on you Things get worse with every hour The future fades into the past All they want is total power Climbing on the backs of the working class We don't wanna fight'Cause you tell us to So watch your back when you attack'Cause we might just turn on you We don't wanna fight'Cause you tell us to So watch your back when you attack'Cause we might just turn on youI know you and you wanna be here Not being around is what you most fear You know me and I feel the same Life is cruel, this isn't a game Time always seems in such a hurry Don’t wait for the man beat up with worry You looked in her eyes and figured it out You won't always be about You won't always be about I’m telling you she's gonna be ok I'm telling you that she'll pull through and find her own way Telling you she is gonna win this fight I'm telling you she's gonna be ...She's gonna be alright It breaks your heart but you don't let it show It’s not ideal but at least you know She’s got great friends and family To pull her through eventually Bound to be days that are filled with pain She closes her eyes cause she with you again She's part of you so there’s no surprise She's stronger than you realize Stronger than you realizeEverybody's got a number tattooed on their soul And the time's gonna come, boys, when your number's called Everybody gets a uniform and a hut to live in They give you your rank, you tell 'em your next of kin There's no escape for the likes of you, my friend But I'm gonna be out on an island In the middle of the bright blue sea Out on an island Where nobody's gonna bother looking for me Everybody gets the training, in the wind and the rain Ten miles cross country, driving you insane Everybody gets to jump the hoop and march in time Yeah, you just gotta remember you gotta toe the line So don't go looking over your shoulder for me'Cause I'm gonna be out on an island In the middle of the bright blue sea Out on an island Where nobody's gonna bother looking for meYears of being told you ain't as good as us Join the line, sign your name And they all said that our country's going bust But no-one's fooling us again CH OR US:England belongs to me A nation's pride the dirty water of the rivers No one can take away our memory England belongs to me We'll show the world that the boys are back to stay And you all know what we can do Heads held high, fighting all the way, for the red, white, and blue CH OR US Never been one to walk that road I've  never been one to do as I'm told I've  never been one to forget what I'm taught I've never been outrun I've never been outfought I  was born in a house like you On  a street like you In a town like you Every  day I went to school like you Played the fool like you Broke the rules like you Never seen sense in staying too long I've  never seen sense in righting my wrongs I've never seen sense in trying to fit I've never seen the end I've never had to quit I was born in a house like you On a street like you In a town like you Every day I went to school like you Played the fool like you Broke the rules like youTower blocks we lived in all come tumbling down Moved out to another slum in another part of town Playing football in the street and pissing in the lift Who really ever thought it would come to this East Ham High Street market on a Saturday Stuffing things in coats, making our getaway Back round Charlie's house to see just what we'd got In school Monday morning we'd just flog the lot Blame the teachers, blame the schools Blame the parents, come on blame one and all Blame the coppers, blame the drugs Blame the system, but don't blame us Games of chicken in the kitchen with a carving knife Eight stitches in my hand, I think I got off light Your girlfriend's there in tears your mate's made another pass When's he gonna learn he only has to ask Blame the teachers, blame the schools Blame the parents, come on blame one and all Blame the coppers, blame the drugs Blame the system, but don't blame us Schoolteachers sing you won't come to anything There's no future in playing these dives But looking back today we won't have it another way Because we had the times of our lives
