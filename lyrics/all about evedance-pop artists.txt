I sit by the harbour The sea calls to me I hide in the water But l need to breathe You are an ocean wave, my love crashing at the bow I am a galley slave, my love If only I could find out the way To sail you maybe I'll just stow away I've been run aground So sad for a sailor I felt safe and sound But needed the danger You are an ocean wave, my love crashing at the bow I am a galley slave, my love If only I could find out the way To sail you maybe I'll just stow away You are an ocean wave, my love crashing at the bow I am a galley slave, my love If only I could find out the way To sail you maybe I'll just stow awayWhere have the flowers gone sun-children Your shirts are loud and your hair is long Now do you ever think we'll make it Something more than a uniform And we're almost there We learn to love and we learn to give And we earn the flowers in our hair Where has the vision gone sun-children Colours glow but your eyes are closed I swear I still believe we'll make it In your eyes I see your soul And we're almost there We learn to love and we learn to give And we earn the flowers in our hair my friend So take my hand One day is always too far away I wish we had the hearts of children Their eyes are wide and their love is pure But we only dare to say 'please love me'At the seventh glass of wine...And we're almost there We learn to love and we learn to give And we earn the flowers in our hair my friend So take my hand One day is always too far awayCan't see the wood for all of the trees Can't hear the wind for the breeze that whispers Voice in your head..  you like what it said So what can you do but listen to it What kind of fool Lays all that's precious to waste What kind of fool Leaves all their treasure to rust in the rain They'll need it again when the sky clears What kind of fool Won't discover the jewel'Til the dust clears ?Fools like us...Fools who want more than they've treasured before Wanting the dawn of the brightest morning Reach for the stars 'cause they're sweeter by far Than the moon 'though she's brighter And closer to you...What kind of fool Lays all that's precious to waste What kind of fool Leaves all their treasure to rust in the rain They'll need it again when the sky clears What kind of fool Won't discover the jewel'Til the dust clears ?Fools like us.. There's a Victorian tin, I keep my memories in I found it up in the attic After looking inside, I find the things that I'm hiding...The leaves saved from a mistletoe kiss Only nostalgia has me feeling like this...Like I miss you It must be the time of year Remember December It's like a wintergreen beside a diamond stream Remember December A fall of snow and the afterglow It could be taking our breath away But the years stand in the way Remember December How does it make you feel inside Beneath a Valentine, I see a locket is shining I think it must be the wine Makes me feel it's all real Where nothing seems to rhyme To breathe life into the dust of a keepsake I might as well try to fix a chain on a snowflake Or a heartache It must be the time of yearHave you ever wondered much at all About your behaviour Or worried about the role you play Grey against the scenery Black cloud calls by Black cloud, blue sky Black birds, your words Too dark to fly When reason starts to fade and fall away I want to take a gun to you Oh rain another day...While we move as angels Gather up your blues and clear the way Oh I hate the games you play While we're touched by Jesus Gather up your blues And get out of the way Sand invades your shoes like a desert It's nothing to die about And our heels are high enough To crush the lizard Take 'em off and shake it out The sting in the tail Is destined to fail Our skin, takes in no poisonDress me in scarlet Ribbons and bows so everyone knows I'm hiding a face That hadn't the grace to go free Dress me in shadows Sad April skies have opened my eyes To the lie that I live And given the river away I'll change these clothes if I want to, and I do I think that I've found out What no-one's about to tell me I think that I've found out I don't wear scarlet well Waiting before me Poets and painters may say;"When will you stumble our way Kick off your red shoes and fly now"I'll die for their words if I want to, and I do Always before me Poets and sages may say;"We've been lamenting your fall And carving it all into stone here And skimming them into the river, just for you..."After laughing at the stars The time arrives to coincide With all the chaos and the sparks Of when two worlds collide And it's been hours now Feels like days We've been hours now In these waves We've been phased We've been alchemized Melted, liquefied and dried And left to crystallize And it's been hours now Feels like days We've been hours now In these waves We've been phased We've been phased And it's been hours And it's been hours now Feels like days We've been hours now In these wavesShe saw that he closed the door She stole a look in the guarded book His prose was a line of crows On a washing line in the summer time And the wind blew the crows around Some made the sky, some hit the ground She never heard a fuller sound It comes as no surprise She's in love with the dreamer So in love with his world She's in love with the dreamer So in love with his world He had songs you could sing along to In any time, in any key They were jewels in Elysian pools In eternity for all to see And the water helped the jewels to shine Some like the stars and some like wine In the eyes of earthbound angels It comes as no surprise...She's in love with the dreamer So in love with his world She's in love with the dreamer So in love with his worldSix o'clock, all the closing shops And the rainbows on the pavements Of a sleepy town October leaves were wept from the trees In tears of grief and strange relief And sympathy...  all for me Do you remember walking out The day it rained forever And you were wondering If I held dreams of wedding rings Well, farewell Mr  Sorrow Farewell Mr  Sorrow Tomorrow is my own I believe we made a vow Beside the fireside but I'm sure I lied When I promised you That I would never want to sing Along with anything But for the strings of your guitar..here you are Do you remember walking out The day it rained forever And you were wondering If I held dreams of wedding ringsI sit by the harbour The sea calls to me I hide in the water But l need to breathe You are an ocean wave, my love crashing at the bow I am a galley slave, my love If only I could find out the way To sail you maybe I'll just stow away I've been run aground So sad for a sailor I felt safe and sound But needed the danger You are an ocean wave, my love crashing at the bow I am a galley slave, my love If only I could find out the way To sail you maybe I'll just stow away You are an ocean wave, my love crashing at the bow I am a galley slave, my love If only I could find out the way To sail you maybe I'll just stow away
