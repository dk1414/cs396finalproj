I am A magical, mystical manifestation of life I am A professional, powerful lyricist grabbin the mic I can Imagine a world where all boys and girls Have a reason to live I stand For justice, equality Present and past what was and what is I am Guiding the ships to shores In the still of the night Beams of light Reflecting On the past and the stories held Beneath my waters Marauders fell Deep I am eternally yours Hand in the jaws Yearning for freedom just because It brings me Closer to the omnipotent one Love is a tumble that’s second to none I stumble and get right up back upon My feet screaming the words I’ve heard I shall overcome Retreat Never an option Stay with concoctions Love and honesty, truth eruptions Combining power to kill corruption Still never missing a beatHome, home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home I've been waiting I've been waiting To come home again So now I can smile So now I can smile Walking with dignity in the face of the sun A brilliant light shining down, I have come Holding the truth in my heart with every beat And the proof is in every breath that I speak Do you know what it takes to have no fear When you've lost everything you held so dear If there's a last time, let this be the last crime The scale is off balance and justice is half blind We don't create wars, we create life We exist in spite of the strife Unrelenting, unbroken Speaking for all that is unspoken Under pressure but unsilent and undeterred Unapologetically demanding to be heard Unwrapping the layers of what is unseen Uncover the dirt and come clean I'm homeNew slave labor, poor kids lose Walk around the neighborhood and see cops cruise Hunting, looking for a new suspect Lock ‘em in a cell to collect their next check Three strike rule means kids out of school Straight down the pipeline for a lifetime Military guns,  fools Never can win when it's designed to lose Girl beat down because she had a cell phone Boy got back now he's in a group home Don’t need to look around the world to know it’s strange When a cop kills a kid at point blank range Block by block Feel a city rock Tension, release No justice, no peace!Fire, ruin, crush, powder I just want to watch it crumble Fire, ruin, smash power I just want to watch it crumble down Fuck the system, no room for reform Ain’t no integrity in your uniform Fuck your bullets and your gun powder We won’t keep quiet, we only get louderI am A magical, mystical manifestation of life I am A professional, powerful lyricist grabbin the mic I can Imagine a world where all boys and girls Have a reason
