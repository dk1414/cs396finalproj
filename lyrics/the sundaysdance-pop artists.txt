People I know, places I go Make me feel tongue-tied I can see how people look down They're on the inside Here's where the story ends People I see, weary of me Showing my good side I can see how, people look down I'm on the outside Here's where the story ends Ooh, here's where the story ends It's that little souvenir of a terrible year Which makes my eyes feel sore Oh, I never should have said the books that you read Were all I loved you for It's that little souvenir of a terrible year Which makes me wonder why And it's the memories of the shed that make me turn red Surprise, surprise, surpriseI guess I'd rather stay Moving on from better days I miss my better ways Wish I never saw your face But that's okay-ay Ice and Fire I hit you with that warm desire I wanna see you take me higher You must've known, I'm not a fighter Bad decisions I'm sick of all the repetition What happened to the new edition It's crazy how the plot has thickened I guess I'd rather stay Moving on from better days I miss my better ways Wish I never saw your face But that's okay-ay Hearts are burning Can't you see my chest is turning But I can see that you're still learning I don't know if this is working New beginning If its a game, then I'm not winning I need to sit, my world is spinning This punishment is awfully fittingOh, I vow that it's goodbye Oh, I vow that it's goodbye and God bless Why did we have to assume We're exactly the same Oh, no, no, talking about yourself, self, self Oh, I vow that it's goodbye to the old ways Those stories were a good read They were dumb as well I could never be seen Falling down on my knees, crawling Oh, no, no, talk about a sell, sell, sell It's unfair It's unfair It's unfair Oh, as the heavens shudder baby I belong to you Oh, they said you get what you deserve And all they said was true So, is this what it's come to Am I cold or just a little bit warm Oh, well Just give me an easy life and a peaceful death Yeah, yeahWhere's the harm in voicing a doubt You'll find me in the lavatory And where's the harm in talking out loud When I'm on my own What's so wrong with reading my stars When I'll be in the lavatory And what is so wrong with counting the cars When I'm all alone You're not the only one that I know But I'm too proud to talk to you anyway You're not the only one that I know But I'm far too proud to talk to you any day So I say I'm in love with the world And what is so wrong with voicing a doubt When I'm on my own It's perfectly fine to sleep in a chair From Monday 'til Saturday And what is so wrong with talking out loud When I'm all alone You're not the only one that I know But I'm too proud to talk to you anyway You're, you're not the only one that I know But I'm far too proud to talk to you any dayGive me a story and give me a bed Give me possessions Oh love, luck, and money they go to my head like wildfire It's good to have something to live for, you'll find Live for tomorrow Live for a job and a perfect behind, high time England my country, the home of the free Such miserable weather But England's as happy as England can be Why cry And did you know desire's a terrible thing The worst that I can find And did you know desire's a terrible thing But I rely on mine Ah-ah England my country, the home of the free Such miserable weather But England's as happy as England can be Why cry And did you know desire's a terrible thing The worst that I can find And did you know desire's a terrible thing But I rely on mine Did you know desire's a terrible thing It makes the world go blind But if desire, desire's a terrible thing You know that I really don't mindWhen the weather's fine, when it's sunny outside Think about the time I kicked a boy 'til he cried Oh, I could've been wrong, but I don't think I was He's such a child When I am alone, I remember so well How merrily I tripped a boy so he fell Oh I could've been wrong, but I don't think I was He's totally wild And I've been wondering lately just who's gonna save me Now I have a cold, and no story to tell I'd marry you but I'm so unwell Oh well I could've been wrong But I don't think I was He's totally wild And I've been wondering lately Just who's gonna save me Yes, you should've been wise Oh, hysterical child Where'd you learn to do thatI feel fine Don't wake me up yet Oh, the young and the old they get everything And it's my turn And I'm here I'm someone to know I'm calling the tune but I'm losing the words Laughingly I take the fevered applause Of the people by the riverside I'm walking, walking on water God knows why And I'm losing the words, losing the words I am a man, well, nearly Celebrate life Be good to yourself You're wrong That's all wrong Don't wake me like that I was dreaming and I'd rather just carry on Give me a love and hate on both my hands I'll show you what I'm made of Wasting my breath when I say thatI'm just a psycho with spare time Once I get my head right I'm picking up the pieces that we've chosen to ignore Babe I've got my hands tied Back against a landslide Wondering how I've wound up on the wrong side of your door You know some of us found sunshine And some of us found more It's part and parcel for the course I wanna be part of something more You should've known I wasn't sure You're keeping quiet I'm keeping score I’ve thrown my vices to the wind I’m better than I was I’ve been in crisis since the crib I’ve been painfully impulsive But ambitious Only life’s Repetitious As it isOver the rooftops a plane in the sky Beat of a bass drum cars passing me by Under a bridge dark then back into light A river of raincoats and a forest of faces Still for a moment then red into green Slow shuffling shoes whisper sight unseen Row upon row of houses return an empty stare Let the daydream for a little while longer Ah.  yeah...Hope I'll never wake When I'm thinking about you Yeah hope I'll never wake Cos now I'm thinking about you Two-minute hailstorm then melts into rain sing me a rainbow it's sunny again Swallows overhead while the traffic snarls below Could I could I keep dreaming for a little while longer Hope I'll never wake When I'm thinking about you So that you know - I never want to wake Cos now I'm thinking about youPeople I know, places I go Make me feel tongue-tied I can see how people look down They're on the inside Here's where the story ends People I see, weary of me Showing my good side I can see how, people look down I'm on the outside Here's where the story ends Ooh, here's where the story ends It's that little souvenir of a terrible year Which makes my eyes feel sore Oh, I never should have said the books that you read Were all I loved you for It's that little souvenir of a terrible year Which makes me wonder why And it's the memories of the shed that make me turn red Surprise, surprise, surprise
