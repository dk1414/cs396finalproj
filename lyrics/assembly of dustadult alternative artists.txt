The second song came softly He heard it seeping through the vent The notes were long and languished They described their circumstance The rent was halfway spent The day was peeling hot She asked, "Can we leave this place "He answered, "Probably not." They had less than they guessed but more than they knew That second song was the best they could do And all of the while there were two: one eyed green and one eyed blue They came from somewhere simple A place too plain to be described She found her own dimensions Ran like the color of her eyes She looked with one eye green And one eye cobalt blue He looked right back at them And shivered through and through He heard his name ring hollow as it sputtered from her mouth He heard the door frame shudder as she shuttled from the house She left one green eyed child and one with cobalt blue He held them close at hand and wondered what he would doIn a small leafy town Slight North of slightly west Yeah Sat a babe with soft brown eyes And the man that they love best Yeah Well The world was rushing like a shot from a gun The vaulted sky shining blue for the Sun Love Anyone There was promise along the lake The air was cold and clear Yeah They were better, just for having been They were coupled by the years Yeah Well The world was rushing like a shot from a gun The vaulted sky shining blue for the Sun Love Any Love Any Love AnyoneCounting hours in a place that doesn't have a name There were thousands who were laid to waste But no one who could take his place No one who could take his place The Ohio River bank was soft beneath her weight As she walked from it her body sank No one's ever coming back No one's ever coming back They came a great distance in the driving snow And the last thing he heard was a trumpet blow Then the sky collapsed and the earth turned gray Paul Henry died today Paul Henry died today In Kentucky there's a town that doesn't have a name They all remember how it all went down The way their shoulders touched the ground The way their shoulders touched the ground They came a great distance in the driving snow And the last thing he heard was a trumpet blow Then the sky collapsed and the earth turned gray Paul Henry died today Paul Henry died todayI hope I find a noble death And avoid an angry trigger I guess I'll find my ripe old self Or at least that's what I figure The sour breath of a disappointed girl Daring the man who could keep her She was born by the name of Lynn But she went by Honey Creeper The bones of an old life call They tear at the threads of my innards Somewhere something went wrong Now I'm living with ghosts and with sinners It must have been 1929 When I took my turn to hold her I felt a longing that I couldn't quite express And by fault I never told her The bones of an old life call They tear at the threads of my innards Somewhere something went wrong Now I'm living with ghosts and with sinnersI went around my elbow to get to my ear Ever since I been listenin' I like what I hear Someone's on the back porch playin' on an old guitar I hear them calling The notes are falling I've been a stranger all my life I've been accused of stranger things I like the sound of Miss Etta James I like the way that she sings My mouth and eyes are circles My visions near but straight The silence curves it bends my nerves And it funnels me through my fate Someones on a cold street walking on a cobblestone I hear them walking I hear them talking Illusions die hard friend You best think again If you press the flesh friend The picture may bend Let the day instruct us let the veil prevail If you need it you best believe itWe are all fables We are all silhouettes in time We are all floating In the stars You are a stable In the acres of my life Your breath is mingling With mine I can all but hear The beating of your heart as it's rushing The sound is pounding and near Love can be crushing Jewel of my bloodstream In the lazy winter day Your eyes alight With sun shot rays Riot of color Is a banquet for your name The world's alight With coals aflame I can all but hear The beating of your heart as it's rushing The sound is pounding and near Love can be crushingThe cigarette case was silver and worn The clasp went soft, it didn't work no more Well the lid was bent;The smoke was spent Come back again -I'm gone These are the things of a painted past Details prevail When the paint don't last A soft summer breeze headed in the eaves Of an old pine house down on Ashland Street Where the crickets speak And wicker creaks Come back again -I'm gone These are the things of a painted past Details prevail When the paint don't last And the paint don't last Mary Kate was straight about one thing:The lines of our time can be simple and certain40 reasons why I often wonder Bought a girl who lead me on through the thunder and the rain Why don't you ever hold me I dont believe you told me40 reasons why I am singing My head is turning and my heart is stinging and You have got me on a string That kind of love can be a lonely thing Growing old gives people the blues but Growing older always gets you confused I been working and I sit for a while And my mind wanders to your distant smile I bend down to tie my shoe Lord knows right then that I am thinking of you I am listening to my favorite band And I am wishing I was holding your hand I keep hopin' that one day you'll see And you'll go looking for a man like me cause I am like a song without notes With out you, without you I am like a little boy without hope Without you, without you I am like the moon without the sun Dark and lonely cause your the only one Hear what I say I'm dark and lonely - I'm dark and grey I'm dark and lonely in and of the day I'm dark and lonely without youMake yourself at home we've been expecting you We've been waiting for you to arrive Black and white images circling you And tracking the light from your eyes Raising your high like the arc of the sun You have arrived you have begun Language is blue and lavender deeds And decades pass with dazzling speed The sun has come with blossom red clouds And almond shaped eyes from the sea Raising you high like the arc of the sun You have arrived you have begun You have just begun We've been expecting you You have just begun Shake from your ankles Summon your voice And introduce the trickle of time Everything's new and turning a fresh And everything is always divine Raising you high like the arc of the sun You have arrived you have begunI was a man with a plan and I landed in New York City I found a world that that unfurled an taught me the meaning of haste I found a well healed girl and I thought that she looked pretty I opened my heart to her and she read it on my face You mine as well as well accept the rest and not expect to prosper When your hiding from the sun Living fast the cold contrast fuels my fascination Like a breath before the plunge I took car to bar and ordered myself whisky You know it's my drink of choice and it fills me full of charm I know I've had too much when my head gets soft and dizzy But if you ask my wife she'd say it does more good than harm I came out of the park that day and I waivered in the place I stood Living deep in golden city in a way I never thought I could I came out of the park that day and saw it with my waking eyes My breath grew short and my heart rate quickened in response to my own surprise There was a fuss on the bus cause someone had got busted I got splashed as it passed and it clattered down the road I seen worse and I cursed and I swore there was no justice And that I'd leave this town before my heart grew old
