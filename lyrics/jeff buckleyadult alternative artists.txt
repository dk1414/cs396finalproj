Well I heard there was a secret chord That David played, and it pleased the Lord But you don't really care for music, do ya Well it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth The minor fall and the major lift The baffled king composing "Hallelujah"Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof You saw her bathing on the roof Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya And she tied you to her kitchen chair And she broke your throne and she cut your hair And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah HallelujahThere's the moon asking to stay Long enough for the clouds to fly me away Well it's my time coming, I'm not afraid, afraid to die My fading voice sings of love But she cries to the clicking of time, oh, time Wait in the fire, wait in the fire Wait in the fire, wait in the fire And she weeps on my arm Walking to the bright lights in sorrow Oh drink a bit of wine we both might go tomorrow, oh my love And the rain is falling and I believe my time has come It reminds me of the pain I might leave, leave behind Wait in the fire, wait in the fire Wait in the fire, wait in the fire I might leave, leave behind And I feel them drown my name So easy to know and forget with this kiss I'm not afraid to go but it goes so slowLooking out the door I see the rain Fall upon the funeral mourners Parading in a wake of sad relations As their shoes fill up with water Maybe I'm too young To keep good love from going wrong But tonight you're on my mind So you never know Broken down and hungry for your love With no way to feed it Where are you tonight, child You know how much I need it Too young to hold on And too old to just break free and run Sometimes a man gets carried away When he feels like he should be having his fun And much too blind to see the damage he's done Sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no-one So I'll wait for you, and I'll burn Will I ever see your sweet return Oh, will I ever learn This is our last goodbye I hate to feel the love between us die But it's over, just hear this and then I'll go You gave me more to live for, more than you'll ever know Well, this is our last embrace Must I dream and always see your face Why can't we overcome this wall Baby, maybe it's just because I didn't know you at all Kiss me, please kiss me Kiss me out of desire, baby, not consolation Oh, you know it makes me so angry cause I know that in time I'll only make you cry, this is our last goodbye, ohhh Ooooh Ooooh Ooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Did you say, "No, this can't happen to me!"Did you rush to the phone to call Was there a voice unkind In the back of your mind Saying maybe You didn't know him at all You didn't know him at all, oh oh, ya didn't know Ooohh, didn't knowI lost myself on a cool, damp night I gave myself in that misty light Was hypnotized by a strange delight Under a lilac tree I made wine from the lilac tree Put my heart in its recipe It makes me see what I want to see And be what I want to be When I think more than I want to think I do things I never should do I drink much more than I ought to drink Because it brings me back you Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love Listen to me, I cannot see clearly Isn't that she coming to me  Nearly hereI'm lying in my bed, the blanket is warm This body will never be safe from harm Still feel your hair, black ribbons of coal Touch my skin to keep me whole Oh, if only you'd come back to me If you laid at my side Wouldn't need no Mojo Pin To keep me satisfied Don't wanna weep for you, don't wanna know I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow Memories fire, the rhythms fall slow Black Beauty, I love you so Oh, precious precious silver and gold And pearls in oyster's flesh Drop down we two to serve And pray to love Born again from the rhythm Screaming down from heaven Ageless, ageless And I'm there in your armsLove, let me sleep tonight on your couch And remember the smell of the fabric of your simple city dress Oh..  that was so real Oh..  that was so real Oh..  that was so real We walked around til the moon got full like a plate And the wind blew an invocation and I fell asleep at the gate And I never stepped on the cracks cause I know I'd hurt my mother And I couldn't awake from the nightmare that sucked me in and pulled me under Pulled me under Oh..  that was so real Oh..  that was so real Oh..  that was so real I love you, but I'm afraid to love you I love you, but I'm afraid to love you I'm afraid..
