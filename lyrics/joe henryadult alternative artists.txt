Don't tell me to stop Tell the rain not to drop Tell the wind not to blow Cause you said so;Tell me love isn't true It's just something we do Tell me everything I'm not But don't tell me to stop Tell the sun not to shine Not to get up this time Let it fall by the way Leave me where I lay;Tell the leaves not to turn But don't tell me I'll learn Take the black off a crow But don't tell me to go Tell the bed not to lay Like the mouth of a grave Not to stare up at me Like a calf on its knees;Tell me love isn't true It's just something we do Tell me everything I'm not But don't tell me to stopDarkness settles on the ground And leaves the day stumbling blind Coming to a quiet close And maybe just in time:We'd almost lost the heart to know How to keep our best in mind We'd almost lost the heart to know How to keep our best in mind Time has turned an angry face And throws a dark eye back to see That what will pass for mercy now We practice unforgivingly As if might and will made right Or either one could make us free As if might and will made right Or either one could make us free Lovers laugh and cross this way Weaving out into the street It seems we never were so young Or it was never quite so sweet But the world is always beautiful When it's seen in full retreat The worst of life looks beautiful As it slips away in full retreatSometimes I think I've almost fooled myself Sometimes I think I've almost fooled myself--Spreading out my wings Above us like a tree Laughing now, out loud Almost like I was free I look at you as the thing I wanted most You look at me and it's like you've seen a ghost—I wear the face Of all this has cost:Everything you tried to keep away from me Everything I took from you and lost Lights shine above me, they're like your eyes above the street Lights shine below me, they're like stars beneath my feet—I stood on your shoulders And I walked on my hands You watched me while I tried to fall You can't bear to watch me land Take me away, carry me like a dove Take me away, carry me like a dove—Love me like you're lying Let me feel you near Remember me for trying And excuse me while I disappearSticks and stones Blood, ash, and bone I shake the tree, swim out alone Turning over the dark Missouri Now that every new leaf I had is gone Gather wood against the weather Pile up stones against the sky String up bulbs like pearls between us And the heavens blackest eye Tell the hour: "go take another"Go down Moses, without a fuss Give in to the lawless water And send that little boat for us Sticks and stones Blood, ash, and bone I shake the tree, swim out alone Turning over the dark Missouri Now that every new leaf I had is gone The moon's near empty, a swinging saber Keeping every prayer at bay At the throat of love for ransom From the dull approaching dayThe floor will have its way, it seems It fights me like a trampoline It won't let me on the ground So this time I'm not coming down This time I'm not coming down I've been talking in my sleep You once kissed me not to hear me speak And loved me just so you could leave Every bit of life wrung out of me And this time I'm not coming down This time I'm not coming down Trampoline Trampoline The whole platoon is overfed And we're in this thing over our heads My mind it's never been so clear But I stutter like an auctioneer As the night has come alive with dreams That hoot and holler, spit and scream Every one of them is sick with lust But every one of them will outlive usWhat does this look like to you A mark so fine, you barely see You have one just like it, too—A twisting vine A mark so fine;Cause I love you with all I am And you love me because you are As fearless as a twisting vine A mark so fine But still a scar Fear plays dumb then eats the soul Like a vagabond with a fishing pole He whistles but he cannot sing It's an awful tune But very soon I find that I am whistling, too And your window is like a star That I sit beneath like a vagabond Who wears his fear Just like a scar The blade of our outrageous fortune Like a parade, it cuts a path Light shows on our foolish way And darkness on Our aftermath;If I love you to save myself And you love me because we are So fool to think that our parade Could leave a path But not a scarI know she's right behind me now Without looking back I know she will untie me; how Then, will I pay for that And like she was the railroad Like she was the lost world Like she was the big hand turning back the sea Like she was the raging flower in the brick-yard Like she was the only thing holding on to me There is no revolution Without boots and song Her foot falls like a banner day And I will sing along Like she was the anvil Like she was the fire bell Like she was the fever I wear like a crown Like she was the bomb scare Threatening with heaven Like she was the only thing holds me to the ground She's pretending to be wide awake To be listening to me Promises her love to last at least for now Without a moment's peaceIf I know my angels, I know what they'd say Be still my little butcher boy, you'll give us all away Be still you wretched little freak, give us room to move Give us milk, you little pig, we'll tell you when we're through My love is like a mountain, her mouth is like a mine Incubating diamonds, as we rise and shine, shine Rolling over granite, there's a smell like cloves and clay And if I know my angels, they'll take it all away Can you get it Now I've sold my bread, to keep my spirits high To keep some taste on my tongue, and my feelings dry They'll have their fun and leave me, I'm like a stone without a weight But if I know my angels, I'll fall just like a king I can't get itYou've been sanctified And I've been tried Guilty by association You've been canonized And I've been fried Guilty by association All the little loonies With a salient obsession Come out from the boonies With their sharpies and their guns And we're loaded with questions Guilty by association Guilty by association You've been idolized And I've been tried Guilty by association You've been terrorized And I've been fried Guilty by association
