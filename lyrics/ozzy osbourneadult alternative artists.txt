All aboard  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!Ay Crazy, but that's how it goes Millions of people living as foes Maybe it's not too late To learn how to love And forget how to hate Mental wounds not healing Life's a bitter shame I'm going off the rails on a crazy train I'm going off the rails on a crazy train Let's go I've listened to preachers I've listened to fools I've watched all the dropouts Who make their own rules One person conditioned to rule and control The media sells it, and you live the roleMr  Crowley, what went on in your head Oh, Mr  Crowley, did you talk to the dead Your lifestyle, to me, seemed so tragic With the thrill of it all You fooled all the people with magic Yeah, you waited on Satan's call Mr  Charming, did you think you were pure Mr  Alarming, in nocturnal rapport Uncovering things that were sacred Manifest on this Earth Conceived in the eye of a secret And they scattered the afterbirth Mr  Crowley, won't you ride my white horse Mr  Crowley, it's symbolic, of course Approaching a time that is classic I hear that maiden's call Approaching a time that is drastic Standing with their backs to the wallTimes have changed and times are strange Here I come, but I ain't the same Mama, I'm coming home Time's gone by, it seems to be You could have been a better friend to me Mama, I'm coming home You took me in and you drove me out Yeah, you had me hypnotized, yeah Lost and found and turned around By the fire in your eyes You made me cry, you told me lies But I can't stand to say goodbye Mama, I'm coming home I could be right, I could be wrong It hurts so bad, it's been so long Mama, I'm coming home Selfish love, yeah, we're both alone The ride before the fall, yeah But I'm gonna take this heart of stone I've just got to have it allI was unprepared for fame then everybody knew my name No more lonely nights, it's all for you I have traveled many miles, I've seen tears and I've seen smiles Just remember that it's all for you Don't forget me as the colours fade When the lights go down, it's just an empty stage Okay Yes, I've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man I've made mama cry, don't know why I'm still alive Yes, the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man Many times, I lost control, they tried to kill my rock 'n' roll Just remember I'm still here for you I don't wanna say goodbye, when I do, you'll be alright After all, I did it all for you Don't forget me as the colours fade When the lights go down, it's just an empty stage OkayGazing through the window at the world outside Wondering will mother earth survive Hoping that mankind will stop abusing her sometime After all, there's only just the two of us And here we are still fighting for our lives Watching all of history repeat itself time after time I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away I'm just a dreamer who dreams of better days I watch the sun go down like everyone of us I'm hoping that the dawn will bring a sign A better place for those who will come after us, this time I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away, oh yeah I'm just a dreamer who dreams of better days Your higher power may be God or Jesus Christ It doesn't really matter much to me Without each other's help, there ain't no hope for us I'm living in a dream of fantasy, oh yeah, yeah, yeahThe light in the window is a crack in the sky A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back The man in the dark will bring another attack Your mama told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers Look in the mirror, tell me, do you think your life's in danger  Yeah No more tears No more tears No more tears No more tears Another day passes as the night closes in The red light goes on to say it's time to begin I see the man around the corner waiting, can he see me I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here No more tears No more tears No more tears No more tears Today, I woke up and I hate myself Death doesn't answer when I cry for help No high could save me from the depths of Hell I'll drown my mind until I'm someone else Don't take care of me, be scared of me My misery owns me I don't wanna be my enemy My misery owns me now Under the graveyard We're all rotting bones Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh Everything you are Can't take it when you go Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh I ain't livin' this lie no more Ain't livin' this lie no more Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh It's cold in the graveyard We all die alone Cover my eyes so I can't see clear One sip away from everything I fear Ashes to ashes, watch me disappear Closer to home because the end is nearWine is fine, but whiskey's quicker Suicide is slow with liquor Take a bottle and drown your sorrows Then it floods away tomorrows, away tomorrows Evil thoughts and evil doings Cold, alone you hang in ruins Thought that you'd escape The Reaper You can't escape the Master Keeper'Cause you feel life's unreal and you're living a lie Such a shame who's to blame and you're wondering why Then you ask from your cask is there life after birth What you saw can be Hell on this earth, Hell on this earth Now you live inside a bottle The Reaper's traveling at full throttle It's catching you but you don't see The Reaper's you and The Reaper is me Breaking laws, knocking doors, but there's no one at home Made your bed, rest your head, but you lie there and moan Where to hide, Suicide is the only way out Don't you know what it's really aboutIt's a raid Oh, no Hide everything I hear them breathing on my telephone I know I'm never alone I been to places you should never go God's really Satan and he's waiting for you out there Hideaway, I've been locked up for seven days I'm never coming out Wide awake, I feel my heart accelerate I'm never coming down Mama said, "You can't kill what's already dead"And all the feds are waiting for me somewhere Hideaway, I've been locked up for seven days I'm never coming out Everybody wants me, everybody wants me Outside my window, there's a silhouette My rifle's right beside my bed Hold on, I'm runnin' out of cigarettes FuckScreams break the silence Waking from the dead of night Vengeance is boiling He's returned to kill the light Then when he's found who he's looking for Listen in awe and you'll hear him Bark at the Moon Hahahahaha Years spent in torment Buried in a nameless grave Now he has risen Miracles would have to save Those that the beast is looking for Listen in awe and you'll hear him Bark at the Moon Hey yeah, bark at the Moon
