In the days before G PS And other miscellanea A pitcher got lost trying to find The Fulton County Stadium Running out of gas On a road that goes round and round Stopped at a Circle K The clerk said “Shouldn’t you be on the mound ”Ring Road I-285 We call it The Perimeter So easy to just go in circles If you didn’t know where you were Driving up from Athens To a gig at the 688 Listening to Skip Carey Wondering why Phil Niekro was starting in his place Pascual on the perimeter There’s got to be an exit here Pascual on the perimeter There’s got to be an exit here You’ve gotta Get me to the game on time Get me to the game on time Get me to the game on time Get me to the game on time Get me to the game on time As a kid in Arizona, we didn't have our own team But I was drawn to the Braves of Aaron, Mathews and Spahn When we moved to The Bay, I got Mc Covey, Marichal and Mays It was heaven and then in '68, the A's came along With Captain Sal, Reggie, Joe Rudi  and Rollie Having two teams to love was out of sight When Seattle became home, spent my nights in the Dome I still think the Mariners, Giants and A's are all right A fair weather fan is not what I am Even though my zip code has changed I might smile and enjoy where I'm currently employed Your soul can't be rearranged It's so hard to understand It's so hard to understand a fair weather fan I grew up outside of Minneapolis Glued to the radio and the '70's Twins And the sad sound of crying when they didn't Score enough runs for a Blyleven win Now I reside in New York City So I got a little thing for the pinstripes But when the Twins face the Yanks in the A LD SYou know who this small town girl likesIn his 10 years with the Boston Red Sox, Roger Clemens established himself as one of the all-time best pitchers  But a few off years in his early 30's caused the general manager to cut him loose, saying "we wish Roger well in the twilight of his career." He was only 34  Always a fan of the resilient old guy, I was thrilled to see him bounce back with four more Cy Young awards and two World Series championships with the Yankees in the years that followed  It's too bad that those achievements have been tarnished by his connection with steroids  Then again, pride and the determination to prove the doubters wrong can sometimes cause you to take on some drastic and regrettable actions I work hard, I earn my pay, and I do the best I can  In Boston town it's sweat and blood that makes a man a man  But the years are cruel; they take their toll and they get you on the run  34 and the boss, he said my time here was done But it's all right, I'll carry on  I will persevere  They wished me well and they let me go in the twilight of my career Spent some time up in Canada before I was New York City bound  They got no time for losers in that big city town  So I took some chances, I bent some rules, and I made some ugly ties  The fountain of youth becomes a poisoned well when you fill it up with lies  But it's all right, I'll carry on  Now I'm in the clear  I had to prove them wrong, I guess, in the twilight of my career  In the twilight you'll do some things that you would never do again, but you were just a young man then…Now my time is done and no one dares to speak my name  Forgotten, a pariah, I'm a ghost that walks this game  I meant no wrong but wrong I've done  It's easy to forget -- you sell your soul piece by piece until there's nothing leftIf Bobby Ojeda hadn't raged at Sullivan and Yawkey And hadn't been traded to the Mets for Calvin Schiraldi If Oil Can Boyd hadn't been such a nut case And Jim Rice had twice taken an easy extra base If the Red Sox had had a better playoff 4th starter --Instead Nipper served up a big fat slider to Carter What would Seaver have done if not for his bum knee Would he have taken the ball and exacted revenge on his old team If Gooden had pitched like the real Dr  K Or Donnie Moore hadn't had that nightmare day That stuck with him till he couldn't take anymore And turned his own kitchen into a killing floor And John Mc Namara what the hell was he thinking Was it him, not the party boy Mets, doing all the drinking If he'd hit Baylor for Buckner and yanked the first baseman For his by-the-book late inning defensive replacement That ball would have been snagged And Mookie's last name wouldn't now be "86"Bob Stanley picked a pretty bad time to uncork a wild pitch And I'm sure he's still thinking that you could have blocked it, Rich Then the tying run might have not been tallied by Mitch If one play killed the Sox, can you please tell me which I guess everything happens for some sort of reason And there must be a tragic end to every long season If even one man doesn't do one thing he does We'd all know Bill Buckner for just what he was:A pretty tough out for the Dodgers, Red Sox and Cubs Ten thousand at bats and close to three thousand hits And he stole plenty of bases before his legs quit As tough to walk as he was to strike out --But there's only one play that ever gets talked aboutCraig Finn: My love for the Minnesota Twins became even more passionate when I moved to N YC ten years ago  Reading the local coverage of all things Yankees made me realize that being a Twins fan is a blessing  The Twins don't win every year, or even every decade  They don't normally compete in the off-season arms race – they develop talent  Thus, when they do win I get to feel elation and bliss, and not just relief  In some way, it's like music; many of my all-time favorite bands aren't that great every night, but when it comes together it feels even sweeter  The one thing that's always bothered me is the nickname "Twinkies"  Bad enough when other teams' fans call them that, but even Minnesotans are known to use that name  To me, that sounds soft, insubstantial, and it hurts  So please don't call them Twinkies In 1965 I wasn't quite alive yet, but I'm told they gave the M VP to Zoilo Versalles  Oliva hit the singles and Harmon hit the homers  Mudcat Grant won 20 games and they didn't play in a dome yet  The Dodgers came to Bloomington to play for the World Series  The Twins took the first two -- you can even ask Vin Scully  But Sandy Koufax proved to be a bit too much to crack, and the Twins went down in seven but they vowed that they'd be back From Nicollet to Hennepin, from St  Paul to St  Cloud, the Minnesota Twins are making Minnesotans proud  We don't buy our titles so the summers where we stay  These are grown men  These are heroes  Please don't call them Twinkies In the fall of 87 I was pretty much in heaven  I got my license and a girlfriend and the Twins had won the pennant  I prayed more in the Dome than I ever did at church  Kirby Puckett had the smile; Kent Hrbek had the smirk  First we tamed the Tigers, then we were dealt the Cards, and they came to the Twin Cities to try to make sense of our park  It was loud, and it was close, and it went to seven games  But the Twins took home the title and that sweet music played From Edina to Duluth, from the south side to downtown, the Minnesota Twins are making Minnesotans proud  So hey, let's make some noise  C'mon, wave those Homer Hankies  These are grown men  These are heroes  Please don't call them Twinkies In 1991 the Twins were once again on top  We faced Atlanta in the Series  They thought that they were hot  I've never seen nothing so lame as that Fondahawk chop  But we were up against the ropes when Kirby called his shot  And as he ran around the bases, smiling and pumping fists, we all knew that he had won it, though it was only just game six  And the next night Jack Morris came and made his hometown proud  You should watch it in slow motion: Ron Gant was clearly out From Mankato up to Brainerd, from Burnsville to Bemidji  Now we're playing outdoor baseball and that's the way it should be  Raise a toast to Kirby Puckett, raise another to Tom Kelly  These are Minnesota Twins  So please don't call them Twinkies  We've got Justin, we've got Joe  That's enough reason to party We don't buy our titles and we've still won two World Series  Grab yourself a 3.2 beer and raise a toast to Gardy  These are the Minnesota Twins  So please don't call them TwinkiesYo trabajo en Chavez Ravine donde mi gente perdieron sus casas vente anos pasado Y ahora todo el mundo me quiere pero nadie sabe lo que yo hablo despues del partido Fernando, Fernando Te necesitamos ahora Dicen que fue un mania, Fernandomania Y por que me quiere tanto cuando hoy no le gusta mi gente cuando no estan jugando el juego Americano Le gente dicen, "devuelvense" y por que cuando hemos vivido aqui por tantos anos Pero en '81 me quiere, me quiere y ahora que ha cambiado, quiero saberHe's a friend of the Smithereens, an old pal of Eddie Vedder For a good few years there weren't any pitchers better He loved R.E.M  and he played a Rickenbacker guitar But for a night on the town with Mike Mills, you get hit pretty hard Mike and I met up with Dennis Diken and Black Jack somewhere As this was New York City, you may have heard they have a few bars there Jack loved the Replacements, and we drank enough that we became them Two guitars, bass, and drums, yeah, our lineup was the same then He was crowned the Yankee Flipper by the foul ball of fame He gave 50,000 fans the finger, but we'd like to share a little bit of the blame It was Spike and Mike and Black Jack and me I'm told Jack ended up on the cold tiles of the floor With his mom, who was visiting, banging on the bathroom door Next time he took the mound was not a pretty sight And I've always figured it had a lot to do with that night The photos filled every front page of the morning editions Now he's the poster boy for a grand baseball tradition Templeton, Tejada, Billy Martin, and Albert Belle From old Hoss Radbourne all the way to David WellsFree agent Reggie Jackson shows up in 1977 on the New York Yankees, a team with no shortage of superstars or flamboyant hotshots  Is he humbled  Deferential  Silent but determined  Hardly -- our Reggie shows up and tells the newspapers that "those other guys are fine but I'm the straw that stirs the drink." If you're going to be that cocky, you had better have the goods to back it up  He did and the Yankees won their first World Series championship since the early '60s Everybody talks about the new kid in town  They talk behind his back when he's not around  I'd like to slip in but that's not my style  Let me see how you're feeling about me in a little while  The cities got their blackouts and their Son of Sam  There are superstars and then there's what I am  One of a kind -- they made the tabloids just for me  Look out now 'cause there's something that I want you to see I'm the straw that stirs the drink  I'm the straw, you don't even have to think about it  Because they're waiting outside the clubhouse door  Mr  October's got it coming and a little more The captain's a hero but he can't do what I can  The skipper's drunk and beating on the marshmallow man  My swing's so sweet they could name candy after me  Stick around until October and then we'll see  I'm a card carrying member of Mensa  I've got M VP trophies on my credenza  Go ask the Daily News, they'll tell you what I can do  Mr  October's got a little something for youThey don’t make ’em like they used to And it’s sure that they never will again Let it be said right now more than ever before That the Babe was a giant amongst men Oh, the Babe was a giant amongst men Home Run Baker never even dreamed of So many balls flying over a fence There can be no doubt, that the Babe changed the game More than anyone before or since The House That Ruth Built The Curse of the Bambino The Sultan of Swat The King of Swing In thousands of headlines In millions of hearts Babe Ruth was everything’Cause they don’t make ’em like they used to And it’s sure that they never will again Let it be said right now more than ever before That the Babe was a giant amongst men Oh, the Babe was a giant amongst men Did he sock three out for poor sick Johnny Sylvester At Wrigley Field, did he call his shot When you’re larger than legend, when you’re almost a God It doesn’t matter what is real and what is notTake me out to the ball game Take me out with the crowd Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack I don’t care if I never get back Let me root, root, root for the home team If they don’t win, it’s a shame For it’s one, two, three strikes, you’re out At the old ball game
