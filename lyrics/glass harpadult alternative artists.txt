City lights, then the morning comes I close my eyes and I see the sun I know there's a field of green Where the birds to sing, I know Garden walls kept the sun away from the flowers Prison halls where someone weeps for hours I know there's a smiling face There's a warm embrace, and there's a glow Walking down along the shore Kicking stones along the way Many things are still in store today Thinking now about the future I know I won't be led astray Cause I got hope for tomorrow, today Far away and yet so near A brighter day will soon be here I know there's a coming King Who'll bring everything, I knowKeaggy-Pecchio Dawn of a new day it's coming my way It’s coming your way to Full of surprises open your eyes’You may find a few Love is what you give it must be true Give and you’ll receive it’s up to you Loving the weather we’re here together Country life is so good Surrounded by flowers playing for hours All our music on wood Faith is nothing new try it and see See what it can do what you can be La la la la la la la la la la laOne day at a time with its failures and fears With its hurts and mistakes, and its weakness and tears With portion of pain and burden of care One day at a time we must meet and must bear
