I am at ease in the arms of a woman Although now Most of my days I spend alone A thousand miles From the place I was born But when she wakes me She takes me back home Now, most days I spend like a child Who's afraid of ghosts in the night I know there ain't nothing out there I'm still afraid to turn on the lights I am at ease in the arms of a woman Although now Most of my days a I spend alone A thousand miles The place I was born When she wakes me She takes me back home A thousand miles From the place I was born When she wakes me She takes me back homeLook up, child The world is born Shoe's untied And your soles are worn Windows are rolled down Sun is setting high Windows are rolled down I'm fixin' to die Corn rows have companion feel This rocky road and this steering wheel Who do you call to ease your pain I hope for you to get through this rain Windows are rolled down Moon is hanging low Windows are rolled down Think it's time for me to go Is it what you dreamed it'd be Are you locked up in this fantasy Oh, these miles that have torn us apart My new found faith and my broken heartWell I walked over the bridge Into the city where I live And I saw my old landlord Well we both said, "Hello"There was no where else to go'Cause his rent I couldn't afford Well relationships change Though I think its kind of strange How money makes a man grow Ah, some people they claim If you get enough fame You live over the rainbow, over the rainbow But the people on the street Out on buses or on feet We all got the same blood flow Oh in society every dollar got a deed We all need a place that we can go And feel over the rainbow But sometimes we forget what we got Who we are or who we are not I think we got a chance to make it right Keep it loose, keep it tight Keep it tightYesterday, I got lost in the circus Feeling like such a mess And now I'm down I'm just hanging on the corner I can't help but reminisce'Cause when you're gone All the colors fade When you're gone No New Year's Day parade You're gone Colors seem to fade Your mama called, she said That you're downstairs crying Feeling like such a mess Yeah, I hear ya In the background bawling What happened to your sweet summer-time dress I know we all We all got our faults We get locked in our vaults And we stayMy heart is a flower That blooms every hour I believe in the power Of love Well in this lonesome meadow Well it's soft as a pillow Oh I pray that we'll go back To Love I'm going to reach on up over that fear Whenever I'm alone won't you please be near I know that darkness before the dawn Tomorrow's coming and yesterday's gone I'm going to get my baby Get up stream Fall asleep in her arms And drift away in a dream Gonna go out walking in the morning light Well I know that my tomorrow's gonna be alright Gonna be alright Well I never shall wither Well of course I forgive her Oh please Lord deliver meI've been workin' on a night train Drinkin' coffee takin' cocaine I'm out here on my night train Tryin' to get us safely home Well in a little country station Somewhere out in the midwest I see the people out there waiting Heart beating in my chest And I'm thinking 'bout a woman Who I put no one above I'm not lookin' to replace her Just need someone to love While I'm out here on my night train Drinkin' coffee takin' cocaine I'm out here on my night train Trying to get her safely home Well I'm livin' in the city Where the noise it never stops Hammers pounding on the pavement Whitles from traffic cops Nobody looks you in the eye here Walkin' 'round with clenched fists I been searchin' for a simple place Don't know if it existsYou stare at the broken mirrors Shattered reflections of the past I think we may be standin' in the same Shadows that been cast Darkness, no more darkness The broken days have beat the dead of night Darkness, no more darkness No more darkness, no more light And a trail we choose to follow It's as cursed as it is blessed Is there mercy that we all must face Before the dead can raise Darkness, no more darkness The broken days have beat the dead of night Darkness, no more darkness No more darkness, no more light And if you listen to the song that settled on the breeze A woman sings unto our baby boy I won't live to see the day that you'll be lifted off your kneesWe never left you We never left you that day We never left you Even though you fell far away Couldn't hold you But you didn't wanna be here anyway So hang on, hang on Hang on, hang on Hang on, hang on'Cause you already come so far along We never failed you Even though you might've felt that way We never left you Hard to see you in so much pain And I would've stayed there forever But it didn't work out that way So hang on, hang on Hang on, hang on Hang on, hang on When morning comes you won't be here aloneI'm lying awake in the dark While you're out there screaming in Jefferson Park Grooming the doom with the flames you incite Crying like children for a dying white light You're out there instilling your rage While I'm in here with the children turning the page When I hear you, my knuckles in fists closing tight While you're crying like children for a dying white light Your daddy's gone, but you can't let it go Your daddy's gone, but still you follow With your faith and your fury and your bigoted spite Basking in the glory of a dying white light I'm trying to undo what you've done To the innocent minds of our daughter and son I can't lie beside you if you're willing to fight For your broken brotherhood and the dying white light I'll be leaving in the morning at sunlight's first sight And you'll be living alone in your dying white lightSee you in the doorway Those tears on your face Singing "Stand by Me"Wanna make you see I can keep you safe Don't need no one to fix you'Cause, babe, you ain't broken There's hope in your eyes, a new sun will rise You shall be woken I wanna hold you I just wanna hold you I wanna hold you You say everyone seems happy Everyone except for you Babe, I know it seems that way, everybody got pain Something they're going through I don't wanna hurt you Don't wanna cause you pain You fight through, I'll stand by you Ours shall be the same I wanna hold you I just wanna hold you I wanna hold you I wanna hold you I just wanna hold you I wanna hold you, yeah
