Breathing in the dark, lying on its side The ruins of the dead painted with a scar And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try The feelings start to rot one wink at a time Oh-oh Forgiving who you are for what you stand to gain Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded Horrified with each stone On the stage, my little dark age Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby The carvings on the face say they find it hard And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise The humor's not the same, coming from denial Oh-oh I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away If you get out of bed and find me standing All alone, open-eyed Burn the page, my little dark ageFive, four, three, two, one, ah!You were a child crawling on your knees toward it Making mama so proud, but your voice is too loud We like to watch you laughing You pick the insects off plants, no time to think of consequences Control yourself, take only what you need from it A family of trees wanted to be haunted Control yourself, take only what you need from it A family of trees wanted to be haunted The water is warm, but it's sending me shivers A baby is born crying out for attention The memories fade like looking through a fogged mirror Decision to decisions are made and not bought But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not Control yourself, take only what you need from it A family of trees wanted to be haunted Control yourself, take only what you need from it A family of trees wanted to be hauntedAll along the Western front People line up to receive She got the power in her hand To shock you like you won't believe Saw her in the Amazon With the voltage running through her skin I was standing there with nothing on She gonna teach me how to swim I said, "Ooh, girl!Shock me like an electric eel Baby girl Turn me on with your electric feel"I said, "Ooh, girl!Shock me like an electric eel Baby girl Turn me on with your electric feel"All along the Eastern shore Put your circuits in the sea This is what the world is for Making electricity You can feel it in your mind Oh, you can do it all the time Plug it in, change the world You are my electric girlI'm not that nice I'm mean and I'm evil Don't call me nice I'm gonna eat your heart out I've got some work to do Baby, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready to blow my lid off Yeah!Go fuck yourself You heard me right Don't call me nice again Don't you have somewhere to be at 7:30 Baby, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready to blow my brains out You die And words don't do anything It's permanently night And I won't feel anything We'll all be laughing with you when you die Words don't do anything It's permanently night And I won't feel anything We'll all be laughing with you when you dieI'm feeling rough, I'm feeling raw I'm in the prime of my life Let's make some music, make some money Find some models for wives I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin And fuck with the stars You man the island and the cocaine And the elegant cars This is our decision, to live fast and die young We've got the vision, now let's have some fun Yeah, it's overwhelming, but what else can we do Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute Forget about our mothers and our friends We're fated to pretend To pretend We're fated to pretend To pretend I'll miss the playgrounds And the animals and diggin' up worms I'll miss the comfort of my mother And the weight of the world I'll miss my sister, miss my father Miss my dog and my home Yeah, I'll miss the boredom and the freedom And the time spent aloneWoah…Not everyone can be like me and Michael The only problem is forgetting which side you're on So you think, the burning light will reappear on summer nights Like all the rest, but they can't find out Woah…In every scene, it's me and Michael Imaginary bombs, raining down from the clouds So it seems, the danger signs will never let the feelings die When all the best and brightest have gone Me and Michael Solid as they come Me and Michael It's not a question now Me and Michael Solid as they come Me and Michael It's not a question now Me and Michael Dead in the water, it's not a paid vacation The sons and daughters of city officials attend demonstrations It's hardly a sink or swim when all is well if the ticket sells Out with a whimper, it's not a blaze of glory You look down from your temple as people endeavor to make it a story And chisel a marble word, but all is lost if it's never heard But I've got someone to make reports that tell me how my money's spent To book my stays and draw my blinds so I can't tell what's really there And all I need's a great big congratulations I'll keep your dreams, you pay attention for me As strange as it seems, I'd rather dissolve than have you ignore me The ground may be moving fast but I tied my boots to a broken mast The difference is clear, you throw it in your cauldron Rust and veneer, dusk and dawn, Steinways and Baldwins You start with a simple stock of all the waste and salt to taste But damn my﻿ luck and damn these friends that keep on combing back their smiles I save my grace with half-assed guilt and lay down the quilt upon the lawn Spread my arms and soak up congratulationsGet ready to have some fun!Alright, here we go!Five, four, three, two, and one Are you ready to work out Don't take it the wrong way I can never keep up Sick of liking your selfies Should've gone with my gut Maybe I'm in a movie Maybe I'm out to lunch But I'm constantly swiping and tapping It's never relaxing, I need a new routine The only reason we never worked out was He didn't work out The only reason we never worked out was He didn't work out enough Let's move on to the next step Og ew ere H!nuf evah dna esicrex EStep, touch, step, touch Perfect form and shape Come on!Get on your hands and knees Ready  Here we go Evil $, I, yes, to find a shore A beast that doesn't quiver anymore And we could crush some plants to paint my walls And I won't try to fight in the weekend wars Was I  I was too lazy to bathe Or paint or write or try to make a change Now I can shoot a gun to kill my lunch And I don't have to love or think too much Instant battle plans written on the sidewalk Mental mystics in a twisted metal car Tried to amplify the sound of light and love Christ is cursed of fathers and martyrs Might even take a knife to split a hair Or even scare the children off my lawn Giving us time to make the makeshift bombs Every mess invested was a score We couldn't use computers anymore But it's difficult to win unless you're bored And you might have to plan for the weekend wars Try to break my heart, I'll drive to Arizona It might take a hundred years to grow an arm I'll sit and listen to the sound of sand and cold Twisted diamond heart, I'm the weekend warrior My predictions are the only things I have I can amplify the sound of light and loveMild apprehension Blank dreams of the coming fun Distort the odds of a turnaround Gut screams out next to none So turn it on, tune it in, and stay inert You say, "I've got the backbone"The back way to escape the gun Climbing a tree with a missing limb And not saving anyone And now it hurts to stay at home and see flash The mirror ball's throwing mold And you can't get a grip if there's nothing to hold You see the flash catch a white lily laugh and wilt And if you must smash a glass first fill it to the hilt Plants, as far as I know, are still Still bending towards the light And if we dance until the heart explodes It will make this place ignite And even if this hall collapses I can stand by my pillar of hope It's just a case of flash delirium
