Burning crosses on a n—ñgger's lawn Burning dollars, what's a house without a home Dance in your white sheet glory Dance in your passion You talk about sugar on the six-fingered beast Conversations about the holes in your hands Walk through the garden of man's desires Conversations about the kingdom of fire Conversations about the kingdom of fire What's that moving in the basement What's that moving in the attic Who's that walking in the shadows Who's that walking in the streets Kiss on my hand After dark, hand for a kiss After dark, kiss on my hand Kiss on my hand Kiss on my hand Romance in sequence, harmful to the blind Burning hearts through the top of your skull Dance in your white sheet glory Dance in your passion Your days are numbered with creations in your pocket Your days are numbered with the love in your eyes The love in your eyes LoveIncurable disease on the day of rest I'm walking on water in a sea of incest I've got the image of Jesus embedded in my chest I can't leave home without my bullet-proof vest Killing myself for the perfect honeymoon Fighting with scorpions tied 'round my neck I hear the pitter-patter of a killer on the loose Children use their fingers instead of words Crosses burn our temples on Slaughter Avenue It takes too much time for me to say I refuse Time is digging graves for the chosen few Children dig the graves of me and you Describe the illness, I'll prescribe the cure Start your two-day life on a two-day vacation Describe the illness, I'll prescribe the cure Start your two-day life on a two-day vacation Spiritual cramp going for my ribs Those gangsters toting guns are shooting spikes through my wrist Children use their fingers instead of words Fingers bury children under the boards I can die a thousand times, but I'll always be here With the powder skull secrets of forgotten years The hangman's noose is drenched with bloodstained tears My hands are the killers that confirm my fears Jesus won't you touch me  Come into my heart Where the Hell are you when the fire starts Let's skirt the issue of discipline Let's start an illusion With hand and pen Re-read the words and start again Accept the gift of sin The gift of...Pleasure is bleeding to smother my words The four walls drain me dry Of all imagination Crying out to be told to stand still Crying out to be told to stand still The price of red death is the price of true love The knights of red death are the knights that you love The price of red death is the price of true love The knights of red death are the knights that you love The black queen jumps through my skin The king of hearts is waiting Close to home Someone's shooting outside Trigger finger's itching Another moving target More blood on your surplice More blood for the price of red deathIn the shallow holes of a thousand eyes In the knee-deep graves of future survivors The fleshless guests live off children of the past And their aging fingers cast the shadow of death Their razor-sharp tongues invite to relax As they slip the skin of your eyelids back Invasive spectators get into the act With roses and candles, silver knives and Persona-read women dance with priests on a side road Your vision perspectives are turning to stone Cabaret slideshow stars shooting their loads Act one is the end and the show now begins...Their razor-sharp tongues invite to relax As they slip the skin of your eyelids back Invasive spectators get into the act With roses and candles, silver knives and Breath ballet prancers spin on porcelain backbones A child's muddled cry turns into hilarity Ungracious freeloaders leave their dead on a doorstep Flowers of doom all bloom in prosperityFresh night, hounded by the head Very dark placid sky hangs above No moon shining like an untouched ass of the boy next door Beginning to feel the first impressions of a strange drug Set the leathery skin of a female, straddling a furnace Illuminates in blue Hands melt against the burning surface But feel no pain, kiss the burner, lips fall away Blood runs down the insides of her thighs She tightens her grip in one last exaggerated movement Then falls to the ground a pile of ashes The burner stands triumphant over the mound And next in line, a young boy approaches And is assaulted by the flames Shooting out like sharp tongues of hungry animals Of a hungry animal The disciple now crouches in the belly of God His second skin removed, the boy lay sodomized and tired Sodomized and tired Pleasure-seekers abandon new disguises Threatening our existence with their faces In the corner of the room I sit and I praySevlesmeth pleh ohw esoht spelh dog Sevlesmeth pleh ohw esoht spelh dog Dog Ereth si on ytic fo dog Ereth si on ytic fo dog Ytic fo dog It's only theatre of pain

em, uoy era em Ouy era em It's only theatre of pain It's only theatre of pain Only theatre of pain Only theatre of painI'm dreaming about her mother dying My mind is set at ease Number the models, spreading disease Nodding to acquaintances to be sure Making 'Him' a household word I'll introduce realism, the eye of the beholder The final resting places of Many would-be heroes In New York City park after dark The time of clinical death is fixed Death is fixed Don't be frightened Necrophiliac relationship During the freezing process Note the murders, grisly attitude Crossed above my head to protect it from the rocks Palliations for a weaker sex Palliations for a weaker sex Palliations for a weaker sex Palliations for a weaker sex I'm avoiding what I can see Dreaming about her mother dyingThe ceremony cradles my head in trance I brush dust from my teeth Fleeing hands and spiders plead for salvation They wash the clawed feet of a priest Ritual mockery, rectified doubt I'm holding with arms open wide Sleeping endless sleep on a bed of nails Wake me up with your kiss I'm waiting for confirmation I'm waiting for confrontation I'm waiting for contemplation Waiting for a place to lay my body down The proud encasings of another's soul Buried deep 'neath the shroud Flourished with the venom of a serpent's son I close my eyes, retreat The prayer hand lays down on the edge of my sleep Sister Death in leper's guise Through crimson eyes of the Holy One Everyone will learn to see I'm waiting for confrontation I'm waiting for contemplation I'm waiting for confirmation Waiting for a place to lay my body downI've come to lie beside you I've come to know the dark for light I've come to trust just one And that one died with yesterday With yesterday Now that I ve laid me down to sleep For what it's worth, I dress my tears in costumes Never again will we, will I turn to stone The drowning edges of my pillow Catch the last breath On a desert leading down The breath too deep, the breath too long ago forgotten I've come to lie beside you I've come to know the dark for light I've come to trust just one And that one died with yesterday With yesterday Now that all honest clocks bury oceans with sand Our tears have filled them once again When will I, will we stand at the shore To cleanse our souls To cleanse our souls Are memories too deep Are memories too long ago forgotten Now that I've left that chance to die I see the end, I see the end Well it was open so I crawled inside And someone up ahead was crying Well someone up ahead was dying Lost in the darkness, lost in today...You can only lose it to your mind, you got to lose it to your mind Waves and waves of tranquility is hard on your innocence Discarding all that was before, Let's crawl inside...La virginal souls devour without shame We lick our lips clean, so clean No one outside knows, no one outside knows what it means To me, to be, set free You can only lose it to your mind, you got to lose it to your mind Waves and waves of tranquility is hard on your innocence Discarding all that was before, Let's crawl inside..
