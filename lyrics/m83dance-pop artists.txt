Send your dreams Where nobody hides Give your tears To the tide No time No time There's no end There is no goodbye Disappear With the night No time No time No time No time No timeI'm the king of my own land Facing tempests of dust, I'll fight until the end Creatures of my dreams raise up and dance with me!Now and forever, I'm your king Waiting in the car Waiting for a ride in the dark At night the city grows Look at the horizon glow Waiting in the car Waiting for a ride in the dark Drinking in the lights Following the neon signs Waiting for a word Looking at the milky skyline The city is my church It wraps me in its blinding twilight Waiting in the car Waiting for the ride in the dark Waiting in the car Waiting for the ride in the dark Waiting in the car Waiting for the ride in the dark Waiting in the car Waiting for the ride in the dark Waiting in the car Waiting for the ride in the darkHave you ever had the feeling That we're not alone All the calls I’ve been receiving They are not from home Going down the dusty roads We couldn’t see through I need you There’s a reading on the wall Of all the things that I have done And we’re leaving it all Run away, take my my hand Sitting all alone Just the colors of the worldI'm slowly drifting to You The stars and the planets Are calling me A billion years away from you I'm on my way I'm on...I'm on.. We didn't need a story, we didn't need a real world We just had to keep walking And we became the stories, we became the places We were the lights, the deserts, the faraway worlds We were you before you even existed Carry on, carry on, carry on And after us the flood Carry on, carry on, carry on Our silver horn it leads the way Banners of gold shine In the cold, in the cold, in the cold Footprints of snow, blind from the road Hail!We carry on, carry on Follow us, we are one The battle's fought, the deed is done Our silver hum runs deep and strong Hand to the heart, lips to the horn We can save, we can be reborn Head on my breast, I'll keep you warm Hail Somewhere Back in time I left a part of me I wanna see if you can try To bring it back to me You gotta go Where I cry And take in all the tears I wanna see if you can try Drink a little bit of me No No Just a little lonely Where I am Take me back in time I wanna see if you can smile If I become a better man I need you - now I know Just give me one more time I'm gonna try and be your friend So we can beat the endSince I was young, I knew I'd find you But our love was a song, sung by a dying swan And in the night, you hear me calling, you hear me calling And in your dreams, you see me falling, falling Breathe in the light, I'll stay here in the shadows Waiting for a sign, as the tide grows Higher, and higher, and higher oo- ooh And when the nights are long All the stars recall Your goodbye Your goodbye And in the night, you hear me calling, you hear me calling And in your dreams, you see me falling, falling And in the night, you hear me calling, you hear me calling And in your dreams, you see us falling, fallingYou, you, you, meet me, me, me At the station, station Can't-can't get-get u-u-used To patience, patience Wish time, this time Could just be a bit shortened, shortened Be-be-be-tween u-u-us Six million seasons Gotta run, gotta run, gotta run And make it or die8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 Our love, our love Ran away, ran away Gotta save it, gotta save it I'm done, I'm done, I'm done without you Our love, our love Ran away, ran away Gotta save it, gotta save it I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm comin' for youArms to the ground Far from the rivers Grace in our tears High on a fever Somebody heal me from my pain I'm reaching closer My stars have lowered Filling up lost memories Holes in the sky Pierced by the fire Somebody tell me this is real Hands to the sky I am a dreamer We build the hope We are believers Somebody free me from my chains I'm reaching closer My stars have lowered Filling up my memories
