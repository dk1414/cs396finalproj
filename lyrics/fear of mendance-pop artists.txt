You are unbearable memories when I sleep I've tried my best to destroy you But the waves keep overflowing me Washing me out till I'm empty What you want is bleached out by the sun My weakness is waiting Could words even shake what I've become I hate this, I hope you know that I I open at your touch I open at your touch You are unbearable memories when i sleep I've tried my best to destroy you But the waves keep overflowing me Washing me out till I'm empty Nothing here to save me from myself It's harder to let go Reality cannot abandon me It's painful, I hope you know that I I want you more than this I want you more than thisI’m like an island I don’t need to feel your arms around me I’m like an island without a shore I used to be scared to be misunderstood Now I don’t care if I’m not what you want I used to be scared to be the stronger one You tell me impossible things that break me You tell me impossible things that shake to my core I will do what I want Woman of wax forever more I need the silence I will shed you like I shed my body I need the silence to know it’s pure I’m faithful to my own morality Convictions that bend when I’m in shallow seas You’ve seen it all and yet you disagree You tell me impossible things that break me You tell me impossible things that shake me That shake me to my core I’ll be brave, get what I want Woman of wax forever moreChange me for the better My eyes bleed to remember The hell that we made Leave it all behind I'm gone Let it all flow by I erase these things I don't need what I left behind I don't need to please you this time I erase these things I don't need what I left behind I don't need to help you this time Leave me Without shelter What if I burn I'm relentless I don't need you When the tears run dry I'm gone Let it all flow byYou give me trauma You give me more than I can bear I rise above you I burn my body on the fire There’s a chain of scenes that repeat in my dreams In the dark my power overflows Do you crawl to your church Do you need something else To give you meaning beyond this world You’re not a mirror to me You’re not a mirror at all I know you You give me trauma You give me more than I can bear I rise above you I burn my body on the fire Breathing deeper now I am free from the crowd I’m as clean as the shame will allow In your fading hour you belong to me now Twist the spine ‘til it brings you calmI possess nothing I’m free from fear I’m a monument to myself I see you drowning Half flesh half stone With ambitions that drain your health You hear me You run from me You hear me I know You hear me You run from me You hear me You know, you know, you know It’s in your eyes when you’re perfectly sane It’s in your blood when you can’t bear these heavy thoughts again It’s in your eyes when you’re perfectly sane It’s in your blood when you can’t bear these heavy thoughts againI fall into nothingness You pull me back, delay my death You move like a ghost next to me And underwater cries won't change my mind But I'll try, for the meantime Because I am you Because I am you What dreams may come What life was won through this What dreams may come I'm afraid to face myself A womb or tomb would hide me well The body and the bones are just a veil And in a selfless way you sheltered me But inside, I am not well Because I am you Because I am you What dreams may come What life was won through this What dreams may come When the waves Meet me and I’m safe From the pain that drags me down And I’m overcome I’m afraid of things I can’t explain I’m ashamed as you burn out I lose faith in the pleasure over time Free from flesh, you’re a memory You’re divine But you grow weak before my eyes You know that you’ll never be the one that breaks me inside You’re a child My ego can’t be kind Leave the past for what comes next There’s no innocence When we kiss The unbearable guilt that erupts at every chance I lose faith in the pleasure over time Free from flesh, you’re a memory You’re divine But you grow weak before my eyes You know that you’ll never be the one that breaks me insideYour words flowing through the back of my head Float my weight, support my limbs and leave me here for dead Purge my blackest thoughts, allow me by your side Shave my head and mark me out As one who does not understand I've done things that mark me out I've done things that mark me out Force my nerves to bend to feel what you feel I could break apart, disintegrate here The change in me is never what you want it to be The change in me is never what you hoped it would be I've done things that mark me out I've done things that mark me out Part of the water, part of the air You’re always with me Closing my eyes, losing my mind You’re the one that holds me down when I'm not present in my body I'm not present in my body The change in me is never what you want it to be The change in me is never what you hoped it would beWhen I think of you my whole life falls in place When I think of you my whole life falls in place I was always waiting here When you’re sleeping here by my side When you’re sleeping here by my side I don’t know where you go I don’t know where you go Is it enough to try to take it slow Is it enough to push away the dark Someday I’ll need to know Someday I’ll need to know I could open up to you I could open up to you We belong You’re the only one And it breaks my heart To see you hurt Because I love you When I think of you my whole life takes its shape When I think of you my whole life takes its shape I was always waiting here When you’re sleeping here by my side When you’re sleeping here by my side I don’t know where you go I don’t know where you goYou are unbearable memories when I sleep I've tried my best to destroy you But the waves keep overflowing me Washing me out till I'm empty What you want is bleached out by the sun My weakness is waiting Could words even shake what I've become I hate this, I hope you know that I I open at your touch I open at your touch You are unbearable memories when i sleep I've tried my best to destroy you But the waves keep overflowing me Washing me out till I'm empty Nothing here to save me from myself It's harder to let go Reality cannot abandon me It's painful, I hope you know that I I want you more than this I want you more than this
