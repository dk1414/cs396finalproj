Road shimmer wigglin' the vision Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror Road shimmer wigglin' the vision Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a—Sometimes, all I think about is you Late nights in the middle of June Heat waves been fakin' me out Can't make you happier now Sometimes, all I think about is you Late nights in the middle of June Heat waves been fakin' me out Can't make you happier now Usually, I put somethin' on T VSo we never think about you and me But today, I see our reflections clearly In Hollywood, layin' on the screen You just need a better life than this You need somethin' I can never give Fake water all across the road It's gone now, the night has come, butAlright, come close Let me show you everything I know A jungle slang Spinning round my head and I stare While my naked fool Fresh out of an icky, gooey womb A woozy youth Dopes up on her silky, smooth perfume Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand I’ll say I told you so but you just gonna cry You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs I can’t take this place, no I can’t take this place I just wanna go where I can get some space Truth be told I've been there, I've done this all before I take your gloom I curl it up and puff it into plumesWhen I was young and stupid my love Left to be a rock and roll star He told me: "Please, don't worry"Wise little smile that spoke so safely He booked a one-way ticket Out west, that's where they make it Six kids stuck in a bedsit To sunswept poolside riches He met a girl who wore Versace Pink feather coats and jumbo jewellery​Gonna be a hoop phenomenon He's gonna be Hakeem Olajuwon He's got a gold Camaro He said over the payphone I try to keep my cool but My life turns in slow motion Bye-bye baby blue I wish you could see the wicked truth Caught up in a rush, it's killing you Screaming at the sun you blow into Curled up in a grip when we were us Fingers in a fist like you might run I settle for a ghost I never knew Super paradise I held on to But I settle for a ghostBoy, when I left you you were young I was gone, but not my love You were clearly meant for more Than a life lost in the war I want you to be happy Free to run, get dizzy on caffeine Funny friends that make you laugh And maybe you're just a little bit dappy Fly Feel your mother right at your side Don't you know you got my eyes I'll make you fly You'll be happy all the time I know you can make it right Boy, now your life is back-to-front But you'll see that's not for long'Cause I know you'll feel the ghost Of some memories so warmDaddy was dumb, said that I'd be something special Brought me up tough but I was a gentle human Said that he loved each of my two million freckles When I grew up, was gonna be a superstar I can't get a job so I live with my mum I take her money but not quite enough I sit in the car and I listen to static She said I look fat but I look fantastic Cut  back down to my knees Gotta get back, gotta get free Cut back down to my knees Lean back now, lean back and breathe Cut back down to my knees Gotta get back, gotta get free Cut back down to my knees Lean back now, lean back and breathe I'm waking up, lost in boxes outside Tesco Look like a bum sipping codeine Coca-Cola Thought that I was northern Camden's own Flash Gordon Sonic ray gun, gonna be a superstarDon't you need me Oh baby boy 'Cause I'm so happy Without your noise Baby, now my head is on backwards And my feet at funny angles And every time I take a step We're moving forwards faster And lately, I can't take it Baby, now my body's intact and In an ordinary fashion And everything I tried to leave behind Is still beside us And lately, I can't take it Leftover breakfast cereal for lunch She's broken but she's fun My girl eats mayonnaise From a jar while she's getting blazed"Don't you need me Oh baby boy 'Cause I'm so happy Without your noise"Agnes, just stop and think a minute Why don't you light that cigarette and Calm down now, stop and breathe a second Go back to the very beginning Can't you see what was different then You were just popping Percocet Maybe just four a week at best Maybe a smoke to clear the head Your head is so numb, that nervous breath you try to hide Between the motions, that trembling tender little sigh And so it goes, a choking rose back To be reborn, I want to hold you like you're mine You see the sad in everything A genius of love and loneliness and This time, you overdid the liquor This time, you pulled the fucking trigger These days, you're rolling all the time So low, so you keep getting high Where went that cheeky friend of mine Where went that billion-dollar smile Driftin'Huh, huh, huh, Tokyo driftin'Two things 'bout the gears, you better listen up Chrome spokes with the spinners on his tire hubs Suck smoke in his '40, windows up He rolls, like he really doesn't give a-Drug lust and two packets in your pocket Disco dust hits your nose like a rocket Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo Scoot-scoot, boy, race out to the super-club Let it rip like you drank all of the tequila Get loose, Street Fighter, tear it up Fresh footwork drippin' out of you onto the rug Ooh, now you're lettin' go Heart beatin' faster, feet pushin' on the floor Ain't nothin' better Ooh, now you're lettin' go Heart beatin' faster, feet pushin' on the floor Ain't nothin' better Wavey Davey's on fire You still got it, you still got it alright, yeah Wavey Davey's on fire Oh, you still got it, you still got it alright, yeah Huh, huh Huh, huh Huh, huhWhen I was a boy, I lived on Poplar Street Just a little child with plasters on my knees Watching all the world from high up in the trees I saw Mrs Moore sleep 'round with Mr Keats I feel like a new man Red flowers in my bed Breathe straight through the crisp air Dead flowers in the sand I am a true romantic Free falling love addict, and I am a true romantic Free falling love addict, yeah Mama always called that woman prosti-tits Wearing lower cuts than most and red lipstick One night Mrs Moore she made her eyes at me Pulled me through her door and stuck her teeth in deep I feel like a new man Red flowers in my bed Breathe straight through the crisp air Dead flowers in the sand I am a true romantic Free falling love addict, and I am a true romantic Free falling love addict, yeahSmells good up here  Yeah, it’s the candle, yo it’s uh… yo it’s uh… Sausage..

I just like sausage-I don't ever wanna pick a slice One is pretty but the other lies Chewing on a fat smoke No filter but you're puffing Sucking on a slim Vogue Dark fingernail polish I'm the treasure, baby, I'm the prize Cut me rails of that fresh cherry pie Shitty old pistola Shot a bullet through my wallet Gonna go to Pensacola Gonna fuck my way through college You've gone with the thick rims Big look with the lip ring and things Wake me when the bell rings I'm gonna sleep 'cause you live in my daydreams You've gone with the thick rims Big look with the lip ring and things Wake me when the bell rings I'm gonna sleep 'cause you live in my daydreams
