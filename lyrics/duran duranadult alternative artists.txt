Came in from a rainy Thursday On the avenue Thought I heard you talking softly I turned on the lights, the T VAnd the radio Still I can't escape the ghost of you What has happened to it all Crazy, some'd say Where is the life that I recognise Gone away But I won't cry for yesterday There's an ordinary world Somehow I have to find And as I try to make my way To the ordinary world I will learn to survive Passion or coincidence Once prompted you to say"Pride will tear us both apart"Well now pride's gone out the window Cross the rooftops Run away Left me in the vacuum of my heartMine immaculate dream Made breath and skin, I've been waiting for you Signed, with a home tattoo Happy birthday to you was created for you Oh, it'll take a little time Might take a little crime To come undone now We'll try to stay blind To the hope and fear outside Hey child, stay wilder than the wind And blow me into crime Who do you need  Who do you love When you come undone Who do you need  Who do you love When you come undone Words, playing me déjà vu Like a radio tune, I swear I've heard before Chills, is it something real Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers Lost, in a snow filled sky We'll make it alright To come undone nowHa-ha!Darken the city, night is a wire Steam in the subway, earth is afire Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo Woman you want me, give me a sign And catch my breathing even closer behind Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo In touch with the ground I'm on the hunt, I'm after you Smell like I sound, I'm lost in a crowd And I'm hungry like the wolf Straddle the line, in discord and rhyme I'm on the hunt, I'm after you Mouth is alive, with juices like wine And I'm hungry like the wolf Stalked in the forest, too close to hide I'll be upon you by the moonlight side Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo High blood drumming on your skin, it's so tight You feel my heat, I'm just a moment behind Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodoMoving on the floor now, babe, you're a bird of paradise Cherry ice cream smile, I suppose it's very nice With a step to your left and a flick to the right You catch that mirror way out west You know you're something special And you look like you're the best Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand Just like that river twisting through a dusty land And when she shines, she really shows you all she can Oh, Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande I've seen you on the beach and I've seen you on T VTwo of a billion stars, it means so much to me Like a birthday or a pretty view But then I'm sure that you know it's just for you Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand Just like that river twisting through a dusty land And when she shines, she really shows you all she can Oh, Rio, Rio dance across the Rio GrandeYou saw me standing by the wall Corner of a main street And the lights are flashing on your window sill All alone ain't much fun So you're looking for the thrill And you know just what it takes And where to go Don't say a prayer for me now Save it 'til the morning after No, don't say a prayer for me now Save it 'til the morning after Feel the breeze deep on the inside Look you down into your well If you can, you'll see the world in all his fire Take a chance like all dreamers You can't find another way You don't have to dream it all Just live a day Don't say a prayer for me now Save it 'til the morning after No, don't say a prayer for me now Save it 'til the morning after Save it 'til the morning after Save it 'til the morning after*Sound of camera shutters flickering*See them walking hand in hand across the bridge at midnight Heads turning as the lights flashing out it's so bright Then walk right out to the four-line track There's a camera rolling on her back, on her back And I sense the rhythm humming in a frenzy all the way down her spine Girls on film Girls on film Girls on film Girls on film Lipstick cherry all over the lens as she's falling In miles of sharp blue water coming in where she lies The diving man's coming up for air'Cause the crowd all love pulling dolly by the hair, by the hair And she wonders how she ever got here as she goes under again Girls on film Girls on film Girls on film Girls on filmOut on the tar plains, the glides are moving All looking for a new place to drive You sit beside me, so newly charming Sweating dew drops glisten, freshing your side And the sun drips down bedding heavy behind The front of your dress all shadowy lined And the droning engine throbs in time With your beating heart Way down the lane away, living for another day The aphids swarm up in the drifting haze Swim seagull in the sky towards that hollow western isle My envied lady holds you fast in her gaze And the sun drips down bedding heavy behind The front of your dress all shadowy lined And the droning engine throbs in time With your beating heart And the sun drips down bedding heavy behind The front of your dress all shadowy lined And the droning engine throbs in time With your beating heartMeeting you with a view to a kill Face to face in secret places, feel the chill Nightfall covers me, but you know the plans I'm making Still overseas, could it be the whole Earth opening wide A sacred why, a mystery gaping inside A week is why, until we...Dance into the fire That fatal kiss is all we need Dance into the fire To fatal sounds of broken dreams Dance into the fire That fatal kiss is all we need Dance into the fire The choice for you is the view to a kill Between the shades assassination standing still Earth's crystal tears, the fall of snowflakes on your body First time in years to drench your skin in lover's rosy stain A chance to find the phoenix for the flame A chance to die, but can we.. No-no-Notorious Notorious No-no-Notorious I can't read about it Burns the skin from your eyes I'll do fine without it Here's one you don't compromise Lies come hard in disguise They need to fight it out Not wild about it Lay your seedy judgements Who says they're part of our lives You own the money You control the witness I'll leave you lonely Don't monkey with my business You pay the prophets to justify your reasons I heard your promise, but I don't believe it That's why I've done it againYou've gone too far this time But I'm dancing on the Valentine I tell you somebody's fooling around With my chances on the danger line I'll cross that bridge when I find it Another day to make my stand, oh woah High time is no time for deciding If I should find a helping hand, oh woah Oh, why don't you use it Try not to bruise it Buy time, don't lose it Oh, why don't you use it Try not to bruise it Buy time, don't lose it The reflex is a lonely child, who's waiting by the park The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark And watching over lucky clover, isn't that bizarre And every little thing the reflex does Leaves you answered with a question mark
