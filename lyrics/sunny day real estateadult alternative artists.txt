Meet me there In the blue Where words are not Feeling remains Sincerity Trust in me Throw myself Into your door In circles In circles In circles In circles Meet me there In the blue Where words are not Feeling remains Ooh, I dream To heal your wounds But I bleed myself Well, I bleed myselfSew it on Face the fool December's tragic drive When time is poetry And stolen the world outside The waiting could crush my heart Sew it on Face the fool The tide breaks, a wave of fear And brave songs disappear To the secret voice of dawn This last time raise my eyes You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time The right words in time The right words Sew it on Face the fool The mirrors lie, those aren't my eyes Destroy them, raise my hand Reflected in savage shards A new face, a soul rebornSo I say, still awake Sleep, close my eyes An image of your face Traced in white sand Underneath, undefined I lay down Arms outstretched I embrace the fall And all the time I tried to let you know Discomfort comes clearly Sometimes, you see right through me Words Words Although you hit me hard, I come back The earth cries When I call On the insideBut you were always one to stay the same, girl I know you want to be the rain And I know that we would fall in there For a time and then unfall again For a while, I'll take you burying old bones Dawn's grey, the sign in the winter light And I know that you can feel the pain Your eyes speak one hundred million lies Don't tell me you've gone astray I walk in circles I've seen million things that tell me so But I was one to play the fool, girl Though rules were somewhat dark to me And I know that we could fall in there For a time and then unfall again For a while, I give you darium bound stones Grow through the roots of your mind set apart And I know that you can feel the pain Your eyes speak one hundred million lies Don't tell me you've gone astray I walk in circles I've seen million things that tell me soI lost myself when I looked in your eyes I tried to disguise myself Fear inside Fear inside my love The suffering moved and breathed Our hands silhouettes Against the sky Against the sky our love Where were you Hope to chain this memory We could have been the last time Show me the sight of the side of chance Hold tomorrow one foot in and one foot out Are you strong enough Are you strong enough, pitiful boy I lost myself in your embrace I saw the lie come clear Fear inside Fear inside our loveSwallow whole Lose myself in you Take a chance Take a chance with me Poured out in wine Chance to run away Take a breath Take a breath Same sign Hair of gold swims through caught in my mind Painted picture prized jewels on a crown Poisoned wine I fall to the floor Caught a glimpse of truth Swallow whole Lose myself in you Take a breath Take a breath Same signChanging every little desire We were counting on forces we could not control Oh, and all those things you realized Were nothing more than a memory displaced through So the story's told beyond our grasp We were climbing forever, an infinite task Shoulders straining with the endless toil We're nothing more than a feather moving in the wind I want to change everything I want to change everything I want to blame everything on Oh, and all these seeds will grow anyway Even though the outcome, we cannot say So, you'll always have your time to shine Even in the winter of your darkest hour I want to change everything I want to change everything I want to blame everything onLost myself When pain from your Heart left its trace In written words Held like a seam I have no hand to heal I can't imagine Your emotions Wrapped around Inferior Hold that iron Inferior My hand to heal Your wounds won't heal My longing for your warm embrace Why can't it see The thinking to me My sense of one is open Time to run And drink like Astiocles So sidewaysThe rain was there to wash away my tears I wanted to be them, but instead I destroyed my chance Suede scarsI feel wrong Falling through you Bind myself What's wrong Made a sign, well What leads to the heart While my clothes were damp What's wrong Round Round We go round We go round I go round We go round Round
