On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes So, if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice"So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy You gotta learn to play it right"You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em Know when to walk away and know when to run You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleepBaby, when I met you there was peace unknown I set out to get you, with a fine toothcomb I was soft inside There was something going on You do something to me that I can't explain Hold me closer and I feel no pain Every beat of my heart We got something going on Tender love is blind It requires a dedication All this love we feel needs no conversation We ride it together, huhn huh Making love with each other, huhn hah Islands in the stream That is what we are No one in between How can we be wrong Sail away with me To another world And we rely on each other, huhn hah From one lover to another, huhn hahIn a bar in Toledo, across from the depot On a bar stool she took off her ring I thought I'd get closer, so I walked on over I sat down and asked her her name When the drinks finally hit her, she said "I'm no quitter But I finally quit living on dreams I'm hungry for laughter and here ever after I'm after whatever the other life brings"In the mirror I saw him, and I closely watched him I thought how he looked out of place He came to the woman, who sat there beside me He had a strange look on his face The big hands were calloused, he looked like a mountain For a minute I thought I was dead But he started shaking his big heart was breaking He turned to the woman and said"You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille With four hungry children and a crop in the field I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times But this time your hurting won't heal You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille"Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in I woke up this mornin' with the sundown shinin' in I found my mind in a brown paper bag within I tripped on a cloud and fell-a eight miles high I tore my mind on a jagged sky I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in I pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and then I followed it in I watched myself crawlin' out as I was a-crawlin' in I got up so tight I couldn't unwind I saw so much I broke my mind I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in Someone painted April fool in big black letters on a dead end sign I had my foot on the gas as I left the road and blew out my mind Eight miles outta Memphis and I got no spare Eight miles straight up downtown somewhere I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in I said I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in Yeah, yeah, oh-yeahEveryone considered him the coward of the county He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy"Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun"Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done Walk away from trouble if you can Now it don't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek I hope you're old enough to understand Son, you don't have to fight to be a man There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky In her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling They took turns at Becky, n'there was three of them Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky crying The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand He reached above the fireplace, took down his daddy's picture As a tear fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words againLady, I'm your knight in shining armor And I love you You have made me what I am and I am yours My love, there's so many ways I want to say I love you Let me hold you in my arms forever more You have gone and made me such a fool I'm so lost in your love And oh, we belong together Won't you believe in my song Lady, for so many years I thought I'd never find you You have come into my life And made me whole Forever let me wake to see you each and every morning Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear In my eyes I see no one else but you There's no other love like our love And yes, oh yes I'll always want you near me I've waited for you for so longWhile she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs And sometimes all the nights can be so long And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light And quietly she says how was your night And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world With my little songs, I was wrong But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right I can find a way, find a way While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite Then I see my old guitar in the night Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two And I'm torn between the things that I should do And she says to wake her up when I am through God her love is true And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world With my little songs, I was wrong But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right I can find a way, while she waits while she waits for meI wanted you for life, you and me in the wind I never thought there'd come a time that our story would end It's hard to understand, but I guess I'll have to try It's not easy to say goodbye For all the joy we share, all that time we had to spend Now if I had one wish, I'd want forever back again To look into your eyes and hold you when you cry It's not easy to say goodbye I remember all those great time we had So many memories, some good, some bad Yes, and through it all, those memories will last forever There's peace in where you are, maybe all I need to know And if I listen to my heart, I'll hear your laughter once more And so I have to say I'm just glad you came my way It's not easy to say goodbye GoodbyeI can't remember when you weren't there When I didn't care for anyone but you I swear we've been through everything there is Can't imagine anything we've missed Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do Through the years, you've never let me down You turned my life around, the sweetest days I've found I've found with you..  through the years I've never been afraid, I've loved the life we've made And I'm so glad I've stayed, right here with you Through the years I can't remember what I used to do Who I trusted, whom I listened to before I swear you've taught me everything I know Can't imagine needing someone so But through the years it seems to me I need you more and more Through the years, through all the good and bad I knew how much we had, I've always been so glad To be with you ..  through the years It's better every day, you've kissed my tears away As long as it's okay, I'll stay with you Through the years Through the years, when everything went wrong Together we were strong, I know that I belonged Right here with you..  through the years I never had a doubt, we'd always work things out I've learned what love's about, by loving you Through the yearsI woke up this morning with the sundown shining in I found my mind in a brown paper bag, but then I tripped on a cloud and fell-a eight miles high I tore my mind on a jagged sky I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in I pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and then I followed it in I watched myself crawling out as I was a-crawling in I got up so tight I couldn't unwind I saw so much, I broke my mind I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in Someone painted "April Fool" in big black letters on a "dead end" sign I had my foot on the gas as I left the road and blew out my mind Eight miles outta Memphis and I got no spare Eight miles straight up downtown somewhere I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in I said, I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
