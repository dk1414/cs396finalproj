my soul as the air's leaving out my frame Now breathe , breathe Breathe , breathe I'm living on my last breath, it's all final when it's final When you fade into a blacked out dream Until my last breath I hope my heart's been fully accessed Past this and my regrets I hope you're all in past tense Marry a girl with accents carry this world's axis Make some major changes and some statements til I'm ashes And placed in hourglasses So you can turn me upside down and watch as time passes Drugs are bad habits before I'm in that casket And the happiness I'm searching for I hope I grasp it And hope I fully grab it and never take for granted All the luxuries in life and still believe in magic Look back at all my fans and know I made them track hits And I hope I never look for love, I hope that it just happens And if I have kids, I hope that it was stressful But worth it in the end, because they all became successful And I hope my last breath was something truly breathful But worse I couldn't say much more before I died and left you"I know how people fucking think out there, and fuck, it's gotta be that way  They've gotta tell you that 'Thou shall not kill' shit and all of that

my patience over here, I'm sick of waiting And I ain't never expect to be in this situation And the manufacturing jobs are fading fast Can't do nothing else, I should've stayed in class I have to wait till summertime to cut the blades of grass I have this little bit of money, have to make it last I have children to feed, I have a loving wife I had a hard time coming that was nothing nice I keep asking myself what am I doing wrong And they just look at me and tell me "Keep it movin' on"They keep sayin' to me Keep movin' on But I don't know where to go Nowhere to go Keep movin' on Keep movin' on Keep movin' on
