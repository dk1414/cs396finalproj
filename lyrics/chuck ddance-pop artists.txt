shit, 'cause I'm cool like this Now how I get my swerve on, I keep hittin' nerve bombs Relax the saluting arms, carry on and carry on My record speaks for itself, I never stopped the hip-hop And I never jumped backwards or kissed myself Good GodI really don’t know what constitutes for “relevant” coverage in H IP-H OP news in America these days, but I really want to give you all a heads up  As you know I’ve been through three passports, 76 countries on the regular in the name of Hip-Hop since 1987 and in 2010, although I’ve never stopped traveling the earth this year, I’ve seen, heard and felt some new things As far as R AP and H IP-H OP, it’s like U SA Olympic basketball, the world has parity now and have surpassed the U SA in A LL of the basic fundamentals of H IP-H OP – T UR NT AB LI SM, B RE AK IN G, G RA FF IT I, and now E MC EE IN G with succinct mission , meaning and skill  Skill-wise rappers spitting three languages, have created super rappers to move the crowd with intensity and passion  The “arrogant” American comes in blackface, but if there was a H IP-H OP or Rap Olympics, I really don’t think the United States would get Gold, Silver or Brass or even ass for that sake Personally, Public Enemy has been setting records in a record book that doesn’t really exist  The 20th year anniversary of F EA R O F A B LA CK P LA NE T has become into a year and a half celebration of eights legs and five continents  All the while, looking at a H IP-H OP Planet across 25 countries while still somewhat supportive of American rap, the rest of the world has surpassed the U.S  in skill, in fundamentals and commitment to their communities  Public Enemy’s mission is to set the path, pave the road for cats to do their thing for a long time as long as they do it right Because of the lack of support from local radio, television and community in the United States, the ability for “local” acts to thrive in their own radius has killed the ability to connect and grow into a proper development as a performer, entertainer and artist  Rappers trying to get put on to a national contract hustle from a N EW Y OR K or L OS A NG EL ES corporation has caused the art-form to atrophy from the bottom, while never getting signed to a top echelon that really doesn’t exist, but to a very few HI P-H OP N EW S spreads like any other mainstream N EW S in America  The garbage that’s unfit to print has now floated on websites and blogs like sh*t  For example a rapper working in the community gets obscured while if that same rapper robbed a gas station he’d get top coverage and be label a “rapper” while getting his upcoming or current music somewhat put on blast, regardless of its quality which of course is subjective like any other art  R AP sites and blogs are mimicking the New York P OS TThis is not mere complaint , this is truth and its coming down on Americans like rain without a raincoat with cats screaming how they ain’t wet  This is real  The other night upon finishing groundbreaking concert performances in Johannesburg we followed a special free concert in Soweto  To make a point that our agenda was to “show  and encourage the Hip-Hop community to be comfortable in its mind and skin without chasing valueless Amerikkkan values Never have so many been pimped by so few It does the people of the planet little good to hear that an an artist is famous and rich, will wear expensive jewelry straight from the mines, show it off, stay it the hotel, ride in limos, do the V IP with chilled champagne in the clubs, ape and monkey the chicks  and keep the dudes away with slave paid bodyguards when real people come close  The mimic of the V IA CO M-sanctioned video has run tired, because it shows off, does N OT inspire and it says N OT HI NG Here in South Africa P UB LI C E NE MY has done crucial groundbreaking performances  Its the same level of smashing the house that we’ve done this year in Moscow, New York, Paris, London , Chicago and other places this year  This is not news We are not trying to prove any point other than to show that a classic work is timeless and doesn’t have a demographic per se  The Rolling Stones and U2 are N OT measured by mere tracks’ they are measured by the all-around event they present  The art of the performance has left Hip-Hop whereas somebody has led artists to do more performing off the stage than on it  The agenda here is to create artist exchange This serves as a call to the infrastructure-less Hip-Hop game in Amerikkka  We know what your hustle is, but what is your work and job here  Faking it until making it runs its course in a recession, which is a depression for Black folks who increasingly are becoming more skill-less as they become jobless Never have so many been pimped by so few Since the music has so much power, and image has become everything to the point that it can dictate the direction of a person in their life It is my mission now to really become a “freedom

they can both start wars and bring peace  This cannot be taken lightly  Its important for the words to be body with the community  If not one dime of $250 million doesn’t benefit the people who
