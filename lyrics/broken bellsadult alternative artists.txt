We're bound to wait all night She's bound to run amok Invested enough in it anyhow And to each his own The garden is sorting out She curls her lips on a barrel"I don't know if you're dead or not If you're anyone"Come on and get the minimum Before you open up your eyes This army has so many heads To analyze Come on and get your overdose Collect it at the borderline And they want to get up in your head'Cause they know, and so do I The high road is hard to find A detour in your new life Tell all of your friends goodbye The dawn to end all nights That's all we hoped it was A break from the warfare in your house But to each his own A soldier is bailing out And curled his lips on the barrel And I don't know if the dead can talk To anyoneI never meant for this to last We turn around, a year has passed And now you've got these thoughts in your head You never heard a word I said It's that talk again When all I have to say Would fill your heart with pain So let's just walk away, oh We'll start over again, hoo When will it end, oh woah Another chance for me to learn Another bridge will have to burn It's not about an eye for an eye Because the normal rules, they don't apply Just tell me why When all I have to say Would fill your heart with pain So let's just walk away, oh We'll start over again, hoo When will it end, oh woahShe sold her love to a modern man Good solid currency’s the hardest to land All of that money helps you cover your ass Don't let the ladyfinger blow in your hands Did it all, for that dollar She's a star tonight Without warning She gave up the ghost inside Just like a whiskey bottle drained on the floor She got no future, just a life to endure This good samaritan is shaking her hand Too late to leave here now, the songs in the can Give it up, for that dollar She's a star tonight Without warning She gave up the ghost inside You call it chivalry Never pull a punch for free You ever wonder why they had to move on This phony honor code That put you on your throne A double-standard you invoke when you wantYeah, the face The face of evil's on the news tonight We see the darkness over light But have we ever really lived in better times Hey, strange They say we're coming to the end of the line But is there still a chance to change your mind Or have all the colors turned to black and white I had another dream, I had another life No one saw the blood on my hands When I woke, I was there alone Where will it end After the twilight, always a sunrise But the glow of morning comes with small arms fire Ignore the deadline, there's no divine right Enter the gods and all the sacred signs At the end of your line Good luck, my friend In time, it ends Heads up, dead man My heart, your hands Good luck, my friend In time, it ends Heads up, dead man My heart, your handsSo you showed me 'round your town To hell again and back Our love has served to alienate all the friends that you depend on I know it might seem odd Kid, you're not the only one I remember myself as a lonely child, so I was And you got me wrong You got me wrong Wrong just seems so right'Til the spark of morning light And all those searching eyes Do they scald your tender hide Remember what they said"There's no shortcut to a dream It's all blood and sweat And life is what you manage in between"Oh, what you don't know Is you're too young and eager to love This evening I see you're about to get into the ditch That your old man dugGirl take a seat, rest your weary bones Your secret's safe in my hands Tell me 'bout the years and let me buy an hour Maybe help me to understand Ain't nobody callin', ain't nobody home What a lovely day to be lonely You're holding on for life, holding on for life You're holding on for love You're holding on for life, holding on for life You're holding on for love Light another cigarette, burning in the cold Waiting on the street for your man You're trying not to look so young and miserable You gotta get your kicks while you can And in the Latin Quarter Sitting on your own What a lovely day to be lonelyAfter your faith has let you down I know you'll want to run around And follow the crowd into the night But after the disco All of the shine just faded away Oh oh oh oh Do what you want, do what you will Don't tell me it's not our time'Cause I'm waiting here much too long and Don't assume that I need your love The chill of night has got you dancing away, and I'm Not the dreamer or the dream you're out there looking for How did I get in this winding maze of love And there's something wrong Well it's sending you round and round Still we go nowhere I see the ashes on the ground Another world is burning down And under the cold and empty moon But after the disco All of the shine just faded away, ooh Do what you want, do what you will But you can't hide, ooh Do what you want, do what you will Don't tell me it's not our timeUse your intuition, it's all you've got Keys are rare and there's a thousand locks Stand in your way So goes the gold age Your tired life Digging for a way, you cast a spell Carve a path from all the things they sell But they don't let go Just thought you should know, either way I know what I know Would not fill a thimble So let my mind go Straight down the runway Does one want to Get more used to The mall and misery The debt mounts, the cost to be alive Your eyes are burning from the biting cold If only to learn what you've never been told:That there's a real world And somewhere a good girl Lives and breathesOh, London moon, help me stumble home Let me lose myself along the way I've got nothing left, it's kind of wonderful'Cause there's nothing they can take away..  away The open doors left me wanting more Never thought they'd close them all the way The ordinary life they want for you Is it too much to have to bear But it's another way to win a useless fight You've been lying so long don't know when you're faking See the water on the rise Just another day into a useless night I've been pushing so hard now my hands are shaking See the water on the rise But I've been turned around, I was upside down I thought love would always find a way But I know better now, got it figured out It's a perfect world all the sameWe're bound to wait all night She's bound to run amok Invested enough in it anyhow And to each his own The garden is sorting out She curls her lips on a barrel"I don't know if you're dead or not If you're anyone"Come on and get the minimum Before you open up your eyes This army has so many heads To analyze Come on and get your overdose Collect it at the borderline And they want to get up in your head'Cause they know, and so do I The high road is hard to find A detour in your new life Tell all of your friends goodbye The
