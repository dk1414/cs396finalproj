man Were back in the alley tradin hands Long came Wild Billy with his friend G-Man all duded up for Saturday night Well, Billy slammed on his coaster brakes And said, "anybody wanna go on up to Greasy Lake "It's about a mile down on the dark side of Route 88 I got a bottle of Rose, so let's try it We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe And I'll take you all out to where the Gypsy angels go They're built like light and they dance like spirits in the night in the night Oh you don't know what they can do to you Spirits in the night In the night Stand right up now and let them shoot through you Well now, Wild Billy was a crazy cat And he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap He said, "trust some of this, it'll show you where it's at Or at least it'll really help you feel it"By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake I had my head out the window And Janey's fingers were in the cake I think I really dug her cause I was too loose to fake I said, "I'm hurt." She said, "Honey, let me heal it."And we danced all night to a soul fairy band And she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can She felt so nice, just as soft as a spirit in the nightIn a dream it would seem I went to those who closed the open door And turning the key I sat and spoke to those inside of me They answered my questions with questions And they pointed me into the night Where the moon was a star-painted dancer And the world was just a spectrum of light They reached to my center of reason And pulled on the touchstone that's there The shock of that light had me reeling And I fell into the depths of despair Turning the key I sat and spoke to those inside of me They answered my questions with questions And they set me to stand on the brink Where the sun and the moon were brothers And all that was left was to think They answered my questions with questions And they pointed me into the night And the power that bore me had left me alone To figure out which way was rightBlinded by the light Wrapped up like a deuce Another runner in the night Blinded by the light Wrapped up like a deuce Another runner in the night Blinded by the light Wrapped up like a deuce...Madman drummers bummers Indians in the summer With a teenage diplomat In the dumps with the mumps As the adolescent pumps His way into his hat With a boulder on my shoulder Feeling kinda older I tripped a merry-go-round With this very unpleasing Sneezing and wheezing The calliope crashed to the ground The calliope crashed to the ground Oh, she was blinded by the light Wrapped up like a deuce Another runner in the night Blinded by the light Wrapped up like a deuce Another runner in the night Blinded by the light Wrapped up like a deuce Another runner in the night Blinded by the light Wrapped up like a deuce Another runner in the night
