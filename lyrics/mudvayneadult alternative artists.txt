Dig, bury me underneath Everything that I am rearranging Dig, bury me underneath Everything that I was slowly changing I would love to beat the face Of any motherfucker that's thinkin' they can change me White knuckles grip pushing through for the gold If you're wantin' a piece of me I broke the mother fuckin' mold I'm drowning in your wake Shit rubbed in my face Teething on concrete Gums bleeding Dig, bury me underneath Everything that I am rearranging Dig, bury me underneath Everything that I was slowly changing I struggle in violated space Sell out motherfuckers in the biz that try to fuck me Hang from their T's rated P.G  insight I ain't sellin' my soul when there's nothing to buy I'm livid in my space Pissing in my face Fuck you while you try To fuck meIn this hole, that is me The dead are rolling over In this hole thickening Dirt shoveled over shoulders I feel it in me, so overwhelmed Oh, this pressured center rising My life overturned, unfair the despair All these scars keep ripping open Peel me from the skin Tear me from the rind Does it make you happy now Tear meat from the bone Tear me from myself Are you feeling happy now In this hole, that is me A life that's growing feeble In this hole, so limiting The sun has set, all darkensCold seems crippling Lame meander through corridors Aroma's thick with age Mark off the day Reflections of my life are fading Pull me out of body Don't want it Don't want in Feeble, frail and rotting Descending I'm lost in a structure That's collapsing Don't want it Cast into Maker take the body Don't want, it wants me Past has found its place Salvation is no more Will god accept my peace Bleach will pardon meCold and silent, soiled face I will wash it all away With my love, that's all she's ever needed from me It's my time, to mother One of my own, in my life I am so alone, left with no one In my life, I'm so alone Life submissiveness Hypnotizing the ignorant A little boy's best friend's always his mother At least that's what she said Life of a simple man Taught that everyone else is dirty And their love is meaningless I'm just a soiled dirty boy, just a soiled dirty boy Sheltered life, innocence Insulated memories, spark reflections of my head Duality in my consciousness Caught in the war of hemispheres between the love lost in my head Mommy, do you still live inside of me I'm so lost in my life without any guiding Protected me my whole life from everything Nailed shut the doors to the shrine To screen your dead eyes from me and my sickness Mutilate and sew my new clothes for masquerading Aprons of flesh corpse scalped hair with skin upon my faceAnd we hide behind Lies, anger, hate they shoo love away Shells of ourselves outside Shelters body from culprits of reality Come on Step out!Of your rind Assemble strength Focus Release and run to me you can never look back to the visions from the past They fade and wilt in time You've got to just trust me to hold your hand through Then I'll turn and walk away Eclipse you all  of your states of ain soph aur Eclipse you all And we sever all ties It creates disruption midst circle of friends I become sacrifice Spare your life and leave me to my misery Get off the cross!And save yourself Run away!You'll be okay Losses, losers and more Gain of life's pleasures, cohorts listen behind the doors To a life sheltered in, less than zero in me All my walls falling down, pains aloft, misery I'm sure that the lessons were learned I'm sure that the punishments went well deserved By the pawn in the plan, taste of shit, bitterness Walk from me, everything systematically Come on You're the one, you're the one To dredge up shit inside of me In my pointless life of nothing What I'm supposed to be Who I'm supposed to be What it takes to ascend What it takes to live Patience, pleasures and rewards Come in due time, stare at the sun, I'm bored In a life meaningless soaking up all of me Like the cross, you worship, life is loss, look at me I'm sure that some day we'll wake up I'm sure that some day we'll wake from the dream Of success and focus, tunneling to the light Glowing deep inside of me, your taunting, I wake U PBreathe, breathe, breathe, breathe Push, push, push, push I lost you, you were my god Thought "what do I do now"You were never there for me Never there to carry me26 years looking back that time is gone It was you I believed in Look what you've done to me Realize what you've done to me I can't bleed I can't bleed I wanna break For the life that walked away from me I can't see going on In this darkness I'm blind Beneath my cradle the bough has broke I exorcise my loss, your lie, the punishment It takes time To try to mend the wounds of all the suffering What do I do now It's all I'm asking from you please Send me a sign to Guide me through the times that lie in front of me I'll get by MyselfWhen passion's lost and all the trust is gone Way too far, for way too long Children crying, cast out and neglected Only in a world so cold, only in a world This cold Hold the hand of your best friend, look into their eyes Then watch them drift away Some might say, we've done the wrong things For way too long, for way too long Fever inside the storm So I'm turning away Away from the name Away from the stones Cause I'm through mending the wounds of us Keep your thorns Cause I'm running away Away from the games Away from the space The circumstances of a world so coldJump!Jump!Jump!Jump!Jump!Jump!Cop provisions feed my addictions, mistakes I made Then i opened up the holes and they crawled in Now when it's time for the feed, they won't let me forget They ride upon my back and they'll fuck me with their need My invisible enemies all my monkeys They're coming!They're coming!They're coming!They're coming!They're coming!They're coming to take me away, haha Disgusted!With my position So submissive, I am The only way we get away is give in Sharpen up the razors, stab the needles into pipes to kill cravings So sick of this in me, can't stand the want to need Can't get free, always got a grip on meWhat have I done Where have I come from When I burnt the backs With the sun through a glass Did I seal the loss That's become me Feeling undone What have I become When I turned my back on you I turned my back on myself And became this machine Thoughtlessness Selfishness Hopelessness Arrogant I feel it on the inside Twisting and contorting Memory has shaped me once again Still feel you on the inside Biting through and stinging Will I ever forget to remember Shadows in the sun Filter through us Still wrestle the demons That arrested me as a child Confession rejected We grow up To give up People step on the cracks For wounds owed paid back Through the words of surrender Emptiness Loneliness Listlessness Worthless
