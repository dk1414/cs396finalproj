Go to sleep, you little baby Go to sleep, you little baby Your mama's gone away and your daddy's gonna stay Didn't leave nobody but the baby Go to sleep, you little baby Go to sleep, you little baby Everybody's gone in the cotton and the corn Didn't leave nobody but the baby You're a sweet little baby You're a sweet little baby Honey in the rock and the sugar don't stop Gonna bring a bottle to the baby Don't you weep, pretty baby Don't you weep, pretty baby She's long gone with her red shoes on Gonna need another lovin' babyMe and my best friend Lillian And her blue tick hound dog Gideon Sittin' on the front porch coolin' in the shade Singin' every song the radio played Waiting for the Alabama sun to go down Two red dirt girls in a red dirt town Me and Lillian Just across the line And a little southeast of Meridian She loved her brother, I remember back when He was fixin' up a '49 Indian He told her, little sister, going to ride the wind Up around the moon and back again He never got farther than Vietnam I was standing there with her When the telegram come for Lillian Now he's lying somewhere About a million miles from Meridian She said, "There's not much hope for a red dirt girl Somewhere out there is a great big world That's where I'm bound And the stars might fall on Alabama But one of these days I'm going to swing my hammer down Away from this red dirt town I'm going to make a joyful sound"My famous last words Are laying around in tatters Sounding absurd Whatever I try But I love you And that's all that really matters If this is goodbye If this is goodbye Your bright shining sun Would light up the way before me You were the one Who made me feel I could fly And I love you Whatever is waiting for me If this is goodbye If this is goodbye Who knows how long we've got Or what we're made out of Who knows if there's a plan or not There is our love I know there is our loveI don't want to hear a love song I got on this airplane just to fly And I know there's life below me But all that it can show me is the prairie and the sky And I don't want to hear a sad story Full of heartbreak and desire The last time I felt like this I was in the wilderness and the canyon was on fire And I stood on the mountain In the night and I watched it burn I watched it burn, I watched it burn I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham I would hold my life in his saving grace I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham If I thought I could see, I could see your face Well, you really got me this time And the hardest part is knowing I'll survive I have come to listen for the sound Of the trucks as they move down out on ninety fiveTroubles and trials often betray those On in the weary body to stray But we shall walk beside the still waters With the Good Shepherd leading the way Those who have strayed were sought by the Master He who once gave His life for the sheep Out on the mountain, still He is searching Bringing them in forever to keep Going up home to live in green pastures Where we shall live and die nevermore Even the Lord will be in that number When we shall reach that heavenly shore We will not heed the voice of the stranger For he would lead us on to despair Following on with Jesus our savior We shall all reach that country so fairHere's a wishing well Here's a penny for Any thought it is That makes you smile Every diamond dream Everything that brings Love and happiness To your life Here's a rabbit's foot Take it when you go So you'll always know You're safe from harm Wear your ruby shoes When you're far away So you'll always stay Home in your heart You will always have a lucky star That shines because of what you are Even in the deepest dark Because your aim is true And if I could only have one wish Darling, then I would be this Love and happiness For youOh beautiful star of Bethlehem Shining afar through shadows dim Giving the light for those who long have gone Guiding the wise men on their way Unto the place where Jesus lay Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem Shine upon us until the glory dawns Give us the light to light the way unto the land of perfect day Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on Oh, beautiful star, the hope of life Guiding the pilgrims through the night Over the mountains 'til the break of dawn Into the light of perfect day It will give out a lovely ray Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on Oh beautiful star, the hope of rest For the redeemed, the good and the blessed Yonder in glory when the crown is won Jesus is now that star divine Brighter and brighter He will shine Beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine onThis is us down at the Mardi Gras This is us in your daddy's car You and the missing link Yeah, I'd had a little too much to drink now Too long in the sun Having too much fun You and me and our memories, this is us This is us, this is us This is us, this is us Yeah rocking at the barbecue When we said "I do"Hand-jiving on the ballroom floor You in that wedding coat you wore And you in that amazing dress I was stoned on love, I guess You and me, we were meant to be, this is us This is us, this is us This is us, this is usOh the pain of loving you Oh the misery I go through Never knowing what to do Oh the pain of loving you You just can't stand to see me happy Seems you hurt me all you can Still I go on loving you But I never understand Oh the pain of loving you Oh the misery I go through Never knowing what to do Oh the pain of loving you To love and hate at the same time The line between the two is fine The two have bound me heart and soul So strong that I can't let you go Oh the pain of loving you Oh the misery I go through Never knowing what to do Oh the pain of loving you Oh the pain of loving youI heard the train in the Tulsa night Calling out my name, looking for a fight Well she's come a long, long way Got a longer way to go So tell me how a train from Tulsa Has got a right to know Well she sings a song so sad and high And the Tulsa Queen don't ever lie And she don't care where she goes Don't care where she's been And the Tulsa Queen ain't crying Because I won't see you again Hey hey hey And I want to ride like a Tulsa Queen Calling out to you like she calls to me As far away from Tulsa as these ten wheels can be Lately I speak your name too loud Each time it comes up in a crowd And I know it when I do The Tulsa Queen and you are gone
