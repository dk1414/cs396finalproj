I've been meaning to forget you And God knows just what that means Even so I try to get through Even lonely in my dreams Now and then I like to get around Now that you’re alone, don’t you live here Someone’s lies that just get better There’s that song -Touch it, but I feel it It’s gonna get worse Don't say you live here Don’t let it get cursed I've been living like I'm locked out I can see the midnight skies Sometimes love it would sustain you Only if you're on my side Now and then I like to kid around Some might say I just don't let up Life's not long why don't you live it There's that songIt's okay I don't even cry All I think about is a memory And the dream when you kissed my arm As I look away, don't hear what I say That maybe when I die I get to be a car Driving in the night Lighting up the dark Something in your voice Sparks a little hope I'll wait up for that noise Your voice becomes my home Roam around, don't care what I find A little thunder's good, thought maybe you would But it's okay, we all feel left out Sometimes growing up, it can get you down I give you something that no one's gonna give you My sleepin' skin and my heart deep down in you I'll never tell you, but you're my little scar Goodbyes are hard And they're hard And they're hardTake care of me Whose side you always on And bring sound sleep The wind undoes me Pulls me past The way you hold me brings me back Take care of me Whose heart you always own And lay simply Where I didn't die I free my back The weight it loves me Owes nothing Feeling here is free You light it slowly Your light is lonely You light it slowly Your light is lonely You light it slowly On me Take care of me Who saw your war winds won And stayed soundly When alone I feel no pain The way you hold me brings me backWhat started at a summer lake A sentence and a name If only for a moment's sake We called it and it came Held it down - the loving heat -Longer than a time Held it down - the loving heat -Softer than a chime We've seen how Sick Wind blows But I've got your bovine eyes And I'll love you like I love you Then I'll die We've seen how Sick Wind blows But I've got your bovine eyes And I'll love you like I love you Then I'll die Shot the rats and as they ran From the quarry to the tracks Chased them as you gave your hand And never took it back Held it up and felt the wind Blow and miss a chime Found a god and begged at him To fight your body cryI don't wanna waste it this time And see fate as the end of me I don't wanna waste it, my life And know it was in front of me Together we rock, together we roll Finding ourselves is taking its toll Hear it on the cold wind of this town I'm never going back, that's a lonely road I made it, it started, I can't stop it oh no I will wait for you to call me out, me out It's not a need nor a want, living with his hands out Would have stayed there alone, I can't go back no more I believe I don't know what you want I believe I don't know I don't wanna waste it this time Do you see the fate that's the end of me I don't wanna waste it, my life To think it was in front of me Together we laugh, the memory low Finding ourselves, the phases were slow Cause I don't wanna waste any of this time The body's still wastedSlow down, you move too fast Never liked you working so hard The devil's in heat and I Got your minds made up Way out along the path Carried by love it's so hard And now I want a reason why Way to cut us out Way to cut us out If it wasn't for this life I would leave it But oh I'd miss the sky and the sea Damage to my eyes, I won't see it Don't know what you're missing in me Don't know what you're Oh I'd miss the sky and the sea Damage to my eyes, I won't see it Don't know what you're missing Don't know what you're missing I tried to save these words Leave it to the rumours out there I'm never gonna feel and I I want a mind made upYes, you were You were on my mind Don't know how to distance I can't leave you behind Made my way, understand me Make it with my feeling Just as you have me See a sign We only celebrate these worldly complications And she said We're only showing off for the younger generation I know it's if it leaves I know it's if it leaves Yes you were You were on my mind Saving all my feelings Couldn't stand them right Gone away, without envy We've become undone Some things never stay We've become undone Some things never changeThe trick I tried is to stay inside this thicket Trouble I find can't leave behind what's wicked Let's just say you'll do, you only got two more teething The trouble is sometimes knowing which one you're feeding Know which one you're feeding In this hearts of hearts, I'd open alive I don't know what I don't know about anyway Even though we woulda been sweet Heart of hearts Heart of hearts, ooh Heart of hearts Heart of hearts The skin I tried to stay inside had thickened The trouble I find I leave behind is wicked Just to pay your due won't get you through my ceiling The trouble is some don't know which one they're feeling Now which one are you feeling Now which one are you fearing In my hearts of hearts, I'd open the lie I don't know what I don't know if I let you in If you will ever be true Heart of hearts Heart of hearts, ooh Heart of hearts Heart of heartsYeah you're with anyone Who won't remind weakness Now you're with anyone Her handed-down feeling Waited for my daughter And loved her on weekends Yeah you'd say anything And what was I thinking What was I thinking I don't taste any blood Not without bleeding I see that's all that was But what was I thinking Waited for my daughter And loved her on weekends I'll get back all that was And what was I thinking What's the word battling Consider it's meaning We pass along this life With handed-down feelings Pain is for my daughter And fair is the reason Where's the fair in this fight And what was I thinking Was it something unsaid It's getting cold out Well I'm nervous 'til I find your face Anywhere I go Aim it gets physical Was it something undid I'm taking four hours But I'll never fall out of fate Everywhere I go Aim it gets physical Oh, I'm in need, dependent I will wait up for the call me out I will warn everyone out there Honestly you wanna find me Tell me what you need and I see you get by I was wrong I hurt you Pick me, pick me, and I'm still in love with life Lay it on, I hurt you Was it something I said Fade away the hours Though I never thought I'd love it Everywhere I go It gets physical
