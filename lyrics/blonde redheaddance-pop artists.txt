eyes Angel won't you feel for me from your heart Do return my heart to me No don't insist I'm already hurt Elephant girl It was an accident unfortunate Angel threw me like a rubber man Aiming for the ground Why amuse yourself in such a way No don't insist I'm already hurt Lay me down on the ground softly softly Don't remove my head hurts much too much You never return it Well I wouldn't miss it I shed no tears for broken me You never know it my peace of mind Now inside and outside are matching If you never return it Will it break your wings Will you shed no tears for broken meDearest Jane I should've known better But I couldn't say hello, I don't know why But now I think, I think you were sad Yes you were, you were, you were What I say, I say only to you Cause I love and I love only you Dearest Jane, I want to give you a dream That no one has given you Remember when we found misery We watched her, watched her spread her wings And slowly fly around our room And she asked for your gentle mind Misery is a butterfly Her heavy wings will warp your mind With her small ugly face And her long antenna And her black and pink heavy wings Remember when we found misery We watched her, watched her spread her wings And slowly, slowly fly around our room And she asked for your gentle mindLying on my back, I heard music Felt unsure and catastrophic Had to tell myself it's only music It blows my mind, but it's like that Anyone there  What could you tell me Afraid of what  Would you ever know Everyone else is really boring Anyone else wouldn't be good enough Some place safe, I would imagine Someone new would be so cruel Incurable paranoiac, hysterical depression X, x-x Alex I'm your only friend X, x-x Alex Your love will sing for you X, x-x Alex I'm your only friend X, x-x Alex

sorry, but I forgot Secret, secret, we are bound to forget I was worried I might be rude to you So worried that I was It's a lie to serve the truth And I'm still guilty Oh, I missed So be it Everywhere, everything you ever touch Cutting it won't do it There's nothing to it You were sorry that I was alone So sorry you rode away Putting it on me, but you already knew it Oh, it never meant a thing So be it I can't understand this at all I can't pronounce this at all These are different matters These are uncertain feelings These should never be discussed here So keep it to yourselfTell me how you seek your man And tell me all your secret spells Tell me how you learn To tell by his voice that he fell I know a ghost will walk through walls Yet I am just a man still learning how to fall Try to re-imagine me And I'll re-invent myself Still I remember scenes Of when you looked at someone else I know a ghost can walk through the wall Yet I am just a man still learning how to fall If you start doubting me Then I start to doubt myself And never look through me Cause I'll keep close to myself I know a ghost can walk through the wall Yet I am just a man still learning how to fall I am what I am And what I am is who I am I know what I know And all I know is that I fell If only I could walk through walls Then maybe I would tell you who I was Yet I am just a man still learning how to fall Yet I am just a man still learning how to fallIt's a letter but I don't need to open to read it You can be sure that I get myself in predicament Three o'clock, do I call anyone I don't know if I can get even fake one Might as well wanna get a real thing later You know, I'm just like anyone I never said I wanna be a hero You heard me wrong You got me wrong You heard me wrong I knew his name wasn't Johnny I would tease him "hey Joe, what do you know "I really liked him, he always had something Something to tell me Some nights we'd stay up all night I'd tell him one long drawn out story He takes control, he likes the control over me That is that Three o'clock, do I want anyone I don't know if I can get even fake one Wait a while, wanna get a real thing laterYou will move With me we will Stay still and Words will move around us Surround us in gold And in our world We will be silent You will swim To me we will Be free And words will move around us Swim around us Surround us in schools And in our cool We'll be reminded That you refuse to fade away I hide to stay the same Where do we go from here I don't know For me you flower to be chosen I fall down to be noticed Where do we go from here I don't know..
