Seasons change And I've tried hard just to soften you Well, seasons change But I've grown tired trying to change for you'Cause I've been waiting on you I've been waiting on you'Cause I've been waiting on you, ooh-ooh, ooh I've been weighing on you As it breaks The summer will wake But the winter will wash what is left of the taste As it breaks The summer will warm But the winter will crave what has gone Will crave what has all gone away People change But you know some people never do You know when people change They gain a peace, but they lose one too'Cause I've been hanging on you, ooh-ooh, ooh I've been weighing on you'Cause I've been waiting on you, ooh-ooh, ooh I've been hanging on youIngest, where it goes, nobody sees but me So perfect and so sweet But the rest, feels incomplete Like the rabbit's foot I keep In the locket, with no key And I can't take it, I can't take this world without This world without you I can't take it, I can't take it on my own On my own On these roads Out of love, so it goes How it feels when we fall, when we fold How we lose control, on these roads How it sings as it goes Flight of field, driving snow Knows the cold Ran round the wailing world And what's a song without you When every song I write is about you When I can't hold myself without you And I can't change the day I found youI wrestled by the sea A loneliness in me I asked myself for peace And found it at my feet Staring at the sea All that glitters is gold Don't believe what you've been told People lie, people love, people go But beauty lies in every soul I wrestled by the sea A dream of you and me I let it go from me It washed up at my feet Staring at the sea All that glitters is gold Don't believe what you've been told People lie, people love, people go But beauty lies, in every soulThe sea was large today Just as any other day But something broke in me Watching on this winter’s eve Like a voice, that I’d been trying to hide Pulled me close And out into the undertow I can’t beat it Oh  The sirens sing me home Just can’t release it I didn’t have the strength to go She’s a garden rose and blossoms head to toe And even when she leaves her golden shadow stings I can’t beat it Every time she goes, cuts me even deeper If only I’d the strength to go Like she does But she’s got time on her side And she’s free to decide Because she’s got time on her side To be young is divineDoubled the top knot Flew out the lattice door Do what he wouldn’t Do what he couldn’t do No lack of ‘wouldn’t’ could be my undoing No lack of trying No lack of sighing ‘loo’Weave songs of loving late Dream songs of dying Recite the oakwood flame Rings count my olden days I’ve seen the beaches Breached the peak of ‘please’ and ‘thanks’I’ve seen my features age My fingers strange From the dew From the dew, of the fields We grew And I built a ship for two It waits for me and you In the dew of the fields Is it real Is it real In parting ways And parting hearts A dress of leaves blows to the winds Take these sacrificial remnants—untended Bashed to dust And trust distressed Red cheeks—caved in I don't believe anymore Don't believe anymore Cuz all we know, is gone and cold I don't believe anymore Don't grieve anymore Cuz all I hold, is all I own Is this a desperate wish for dying Or a wish that dying cease The fear that keeps me going and going and going Is the same fear that brings me to my knees I don't believe anymore Don't believe anymore Cuz what was gold, is gone and cold I don't believe anymore I won't grieve anymore Cuz all we are, is bled and gonePerish the pain I was impoverished Those ties that wind And stared into open lanes Stared into long long nights Howling and still West of the Eastern Cove Carving the wind Dawn of your eyes Dust off your smile When you say "us"You make me trust I will never keep you from an open door I know, you know That’s how much I feel in everything you are You know, I know Hot as the day When we sat on stones Watching the fish, run Under our feet, and flow And dove from the rocks Scraping my knees and toes And blood, with me, rose Slow from the sea And you were waiting for me Waiting for me Waiting for me Waiting for me You were waiting for meSeasons change And I've tried hard just to soften you Well, seasons change But I've grown tired trying to change for you'Cause I've been waiting on you I've been waiting on you'Cause I've been waiting on you, ooh-ooh, ooh I've been weighing on you As it breaks The summer will wake But the winter will wash what is left of the taste As it breaks The summer will warm But the winter will crave what has gone Will crave what has all gone away People change But you know some people never do You know when people change They gain a peace, but they lose one too'Cause I've
