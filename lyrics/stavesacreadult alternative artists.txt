You slipped from my arms I knew you had to go Such a heavy heart Who could hope to hold I know where you're going And that's the hardest part No matter where tonight ends You won't escape your broken heart Stay a while Stay a while Stay a while Helpless for the words And it tightens up the air It's not what you deserve It's not for lack of care Inside of me is screaming out And praying for my prayers Distracting and unworthy Of each and every burning tear Seems insincere Do I see God in all of this Maybe all along It's just that we're so small And simply not as strong Strong like wings of silver And feathers made of gold To carry heavy hearts To cover all our helpless soulsWith a sigh I greet the day Feel the morning on my face Weary at the moment I awake But even as I lie A thought returns to mind"Welcome to the rest of your life"Somewhere I've lost my way From saved to stray and failing In silence my spirit pleads Is the vision lost Or has it been passed on Is there any use continuing My soul will wait My soul waits silently For God, my God And I will live And know some destiny Still waits for me His faithfulness, my hope Brings comfort to my soul With a still small voice whispering"Call upon my name and I Will set you up on high Be still and know that I am God."I was far away from here, felt like a million miles Under unfamiliar skies, in more than one way far from dreams I'd dreamed I'd seen the blinding light, there was hope but was there time Slow trigger starting line, and each day of waiting seemed eternity You never left my side You never left my mind So they will open up their mouths, but really who are they And soon enough they'll fade away, only blind but soon they'll have to see Fear like a cancer spreads, how many more will drop their eyes Lift their hands and wait to die, and how much time to spend to see who stands But I think I know the way, I got a promise on the mind, and I'll be looking for what's mine Sovereign stillness whispers trust in me In just a little while They'll wish that they were silent Keep waiting, I'll be right on time Keep waiting, I'll be right on time In just a little while They'll wish that they were silent And when they try to take your eyes off of me, remember And when they try to take your eyes off of me, remember meWhen this fleeting limelight fades And we're alone again What name will your heart speak What is true  what is real Not what you feel What you know eternally Ten years running blind and aimlessly Warming by the fires of bridges burning Ten thousand peering eyes that can only see The show, the smile, the face I allow How many more break beneath the surface Young and bold, but blind and led by blind His person missed beyond His name Was this the hope when we began A tragic generation Of faithless children and forgotten love I know I'd hoped for some other higher purpose What is true and what is real Past what you might feel What do you know eternally And when this fleeting limelight fades And we're alone again What name will your heart speak Go ahead, raise your fist Revel in your mire and filth Like a fat little Pink gets ugly quick Parading your waste Oblivious and insolent Why don't I Just put you out of your misery Out of sympathy I can only stand it so long Go ahead, flash your smile A season of fattening Prime of the canine And swine-bred children of guile Carry on, carry on I know who I am Wretched worm Myself deserving of hell I fell on the mercy You despised and deniedSomehow stumbled my way home, stood inside the doorway Staring blind through rooms I knew were missing more than the paintings on the walls It's hard to call this home, I'm more than just alone Have I been passed by and left behind again I feel it pulling me It's heavy No desire to wonder why the answers have so long escaped me But the arms are open wide to rivers underneath the surface Follow with the tide ease into the cooler water Farewell and all goodbyes to the shoreline I'll see you when I see you Silhouette against the storm romantic standing at the edge A mystery, now a tragedy left to calloused mourners long grown cold His story goes untold and no one ever knows It just disappears beneath the fears he's carried And I feel them pulling me Heavy No desire to wonder why the answers have so long escaped me But the arms are open wide to rivers underneath the surface Follow with the tide ease into the cooler water Farewell and all goodbyes to the shorelineI watch you bend beneath the waves And it seems heavier these days Each time I see you force a smile, my heart just breaks To see you bend beneath the waves I don't believe this is what God ever intended I think it's time to go The sun is going down, I say we follow it out of town We've been here for far too long And in the morning, when it rises Maybe it will shine for us You and me against the world, I don't mind I've been feeling so low The sleepwalkers or the girl, I've made up my mind I've been feeling so low, so low I want you to look me in the eye Tell me if we stay here we won't die They'll say we love the darkness, but I'll say that we hate their half-light Can you look me in the eye In anxiousness I'm twistin'Drift into restlessness This prison keeps shape-shiftin' walls I think you suffocate me Constricting everything So quick to give what you have No idea will one day cost Forgive my skepticism What you call "insecure"I call protection I can't trust anyone Who just gives away their whole world No one gives that up for free No one like me It's cost too much to open it up to just anyone I don't think you hear me Do you want me to say it again I don't think you'll hear me Can't you see it's making me sick No, I don't think you can I don't think you care At least not as much as you swear And so I'll have to say "goodbye"Sleepless eyes open wide Before heaven I stand again If there's no winning this war tonight I was wondering If you could steady my spinning head And trusting gets harder now I wish you were here beside me My failures, my fears and doubts Have been haunting me I'm just not who I thought I'd be Freefall Weightless and terrified On I go, crossing over From living to so alive And purified I know weeping is cast for the night But joy     Thought I was a good man But fell short of my standards Now what am I left with All or nothing And my first taste of freedom Sunlight Such a beautiful day to say Goodbye Goodbye We try to look our best Thinking of you How can I pretend when inside None of this seems right The timing isn't mine There were things I needed to make right For so long, I never dreamed that I would see the end That we wouldn't make amends Come short of reconciling Still memories remind me He's so calm Still and quiet Precious and powerless But somehow strong He carried on Did he realize that you were gone I don't know
