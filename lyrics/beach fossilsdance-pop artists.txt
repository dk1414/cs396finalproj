I don't want your Wall Street Don't got no degree Written on the concrete A-C-A-B Couldn't really tell you What I'm trying to find Everyone's so boring Makes me wanna to lose my mind So call me up tonight If you need somewhere to get out of the light These days I feel like I do nothing right So come with me and we'll go down the line I'm thinking of you fondly When I'm on the train I really hate your poetry You hate mine the same So call me up tonight If you need somewhere to get out of the light These days I feel like I do nothing right So come with me and we'll go down the linePardon me, I didn’t realize what’s in your eyes My arms are open wide But I can't ever decide what I wanna do I’m staring at the sky But I can’t tell which way my thoughts are traveling I'm trying to listen to your words But I can’t feel my head and it’s unraveling Sometimes I no longer know what it means To care about the things you want to do Everybody’s living or they're dead And I’m still in my bed and I don’t have a clue I won’t lie and tell you it’s all right I won’t lie and tell you it’s all rightTurn 'round, time to be on the other way I know you're gonna try and bring me down Run 'round, my feet on the other way Not gonna be in town when you're around No, I won't be there in time No, I won't be there in time This year, I told myself it'd be a better one Try not to fall back onto the knife By now, I told myself I'd be a better friend I'll meet you on the other side of life No, I won't be there in time No, I won't be there in time No, I won't be there in time No, I won't be there in timeSo now you found the time to get away But you don't know what to do about yourself I see it but I look the other way And i’m feeling like I’m falling out again On the outside On the outside On the outside On the outside, change your mind I’m feeling nothing Feeling nothing On the outside, change your mind I lost it I won’t say I lost it So now you turn to me to get away But you haven’t figured out just what you want You see those angels in the alleyway Were they coming here to save me from myselfThe world is half asleep And you’re just hanging on To the friends that you keep Out here on the road Watch the land unfolding under my Shadow Sun goes down Time rolls on You went out with the wind Dreary as you can be You know you’re right in the end Wherever you’ve been I know that you can make it on your own My friend Sun goes down Time rolls onTake a pill and go to sleep I'm chasing witches in the street I'm the last page in your book Can't write a song, only do hooks Watching horses in the fields The dragon rests in agony When I'm afraid I lose my mind It's fine, it happens all the time When I'm afraid I lose my mind It's fine, it happens all the time Isolation caved in I adore you, the sound of your skin So many lies that I found Blood, Heaven, I stick to the ground So many times I realized What I seek for is right in front of my eyes I'm alone in a hole in the ground A theater of dogs is still around My furniture has come alive I'm dancing with a candlestick tonight Flying kites reaping outside my window Smiles with frightIf you find a reason I'll be gone in a matter of time This was your decision Oh you got me in a state of mind I wish that there could be another way But I know that you've made up your mind You know there's nothing left for me to say That could change your mind this time Hard to find a reason Television and another headline Don't believe in Jesus Heaven knows I'm wasting my time Wanna believe in America But it's somewhere I can't find I wish that there could be another way But I know that you've made up your mind You know there's nothing left for me to say That could change your mind this timeWoken up and here I am All too fast to understand All the way across the sea Thinking thoughts of you and me In my life I've never been so free But you're so far away from me What a pleasure all this is I'd take it all away I'd take it all awayYou say that you want me here And I found the door And then you open up my hand Where you wanna go Can we start all our time over again Can we start all our time over again Make our way onto the roof Been awake for days In the shadow of the night I wanna fade away Can we start all our time over again Can we start all our time over againLife can be so vicious That we can't even appreciate its purities We get so excited That we can't feel any of our insecurities All of what you said It went right over my head And now I’m gone It feels like an attack When I’m asking for it back I know Dream – Rebel Trust – Youth Free – Life Clash – Truth Real – Time Gone – Through Peace – Piss Shine – Brute Clash – Truth Lush – You Lost – Time So – Confuse
