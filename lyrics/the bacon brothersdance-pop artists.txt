It’s too hot for October She says it feels a lot more like July And tonight she’s just over Lie after lie after lie She puts on my tom petty t-shirt She lets a tear fall over her heart She says something about a missing bandanna And a world torn apart I don’t think there’s tools in my toolbox To fix this shattered work of art But she can have my tom petty t-shirt With tear stains on the her heart She says this feeling is familiar Seems like I’ve cried these tears before Just as old as those old t-shirt In the bottom of your drawer She puts on my tom petty t-shirt And lets a tear fall over her heart Says, I never thought that this life would be easy But does it need to be this hard I don’t think there’s tools in my toolbox To fix this shattered work of art She can have my tom petty t-shirt With tear stains on the heartStill in bed but it's time to go You bump your head You stub your toe and the landlord says the rent's two weeks behind You catch the train but the train breaks down It starts to rain You walk downtown to the only lousy job that you could find Your boss says, "you're not working here no more"But here she comes like a vision Sliding through the door You say Oh my god Oh my god Where did she get that body What's she got on the i Pod that gives her hips that sway She knows she's an eleven But if I was do low seven now I would take that girl to heaven each and every day But things just Don't seem to go my way It's Thursday night no time to pout Cause you got no job might as well go out And head down to the playground of the stars So you brush your teeth and you smoke some dope but there's Mr  T The velvet rope and all the pretty people Getting out of long black cars T says, "you're not getting in here tonight"Here she comes again Stepping to the front of the lineNever should listened to that friend of mine He said work here the girls were fine All I do is wait line To be told That I′m not right Never should clim the Rockies my lousy car Three thousand
