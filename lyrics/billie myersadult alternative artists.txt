Lover A Mother, A Daughter Sister and Lover Mother Daughter Sister Lover Her needles and pins hold the pieces together She'll thread your pearls With her words of wisdom In the palm of her hand Your future is there Running through Mother Daughter Sister Lover There's no perfect choice as you walk in with your future Be still a child On your bed of eggshells Behind your first steps Her shadows will cushion Your fallReligions all around the world Every man, every woman Every want to be martyr We have to learn, to learn The way we need to live together If the planet earth stopped revolving Would religion really matter anymore And if Jerusalem began dissolving YouæŠŽ see the man from Salt Lake City At your door I believe I believe That there æ†‡ so much more Than we can see I believe I believe That thereæŠ¯ more to life There's more to life than this Should I call you Jesus Or should I call you Buddha DonæŠ° you know Jehovah He read the kabbala Should I talk to Allah Does it really matter God is god By any god given nameWait a minute What did you say Did I hear you say There's no real reason left for you to stay Under your breath I hear your soft voice break"Can we still be friends "I hear you talking But you're just not making sense I'd been hoping for a happy ending Now I know that there won't be any Just a few words too many In my head A few words too many In this bed A few words too many Left unsaid Oh I wish that we were strangers We could start again Start again All over A broken shadow falls across your face As you hesitate Trying to think of all the things you need to say Bare faced the truth lies at my feet As you turn away Sometimes silence has a way of making peaceLast time Your memories are too kind Behind every closed door lies another room Waiting there for you Should I open the Pandora's box Like she wanted me to Outside the time and space we share E always equals M C squared Don't you know Nothing ever tasted quite as good Quite as sweet As it does the first time Yeah the first time Nothing ever felt quite as bad Quite as sad As it did the last time Building castles on quicksand Wearing in all the Emporer's new clothes Reaching out through the looking glass Where am I ?On the yellow brick roadI don't want to make a habbit of this But seeing you is like getting a fix Everytime I kid myself"I'll never do it again"Defenition of love on a cliff A lemming has no alternative I wanna die in your arms That's my suicide wish It's only 13 hours Till I leave the ground And I may never come down again So will you meet me there On a ride somewhere Just turn left at the sun before it sets Let's go naked Would you dare You You send me flying You send me flying You send me flying You're knocking me over You You send me flying You send me flying You send me flying Flying Over the moon for joyWithout a moment's hesitation They threw caution to the wind He thought IShe must be blind not see/i He was no prince charming No beauty She held flowers at her finger tips And honey fell from her lips He dived into the ocean's water She swam with the morning mist He said If it's mine It will be always yours Cast away any doubt And open up those doors It was the Shark and the Mermaid Making love again It was the Shark and the Mermaid Falling in love again It was the Shark and the Mermaid Proving everybody wrong It was the Shark and the Mermaid Swimming by againI've watched the morning undress you So many times but I still catch my every breath It hasn't always been easy So many changes But time washes over us No you don't blame me for all that I'm not For all that I am you say is so much more than good enough Who said that opposites don't attract If you say this then I'll always say that Who said that opposites don't attract If black is white, and white is black Then it's the fact we're both different That makes us the same That makes us the same Friends say that we've got nothing in common In different shoes but it's the same ground we're walking on Everything that is different is still{Still talking under siege}, but that won't pull us apart You say you love me for all that I'm not And I still love you for all that you are Who says that opposites don't attract If you say this then I'll always say that Who says that opposites don't attract If black is white, and white is black Then it's the fact we're both different That makes us the sameN EV ER L ET T HE M S EE Y OU C RY BE CA US E T EA RS W IL L L EA D Y OU N OW HE RE AN D N OW HE RE W AL KS A L ON G A ND L ON EL Y R OA DN EV ER L ET T HE L IQ UI
