Whoa oh oh oh Eh eh eh eh Whoa oh oh oh, oh oh I've been waiting on a sunset, bills on my mindset I can't deny they're getting high Higher than my income, income's bread crumbs I've been trying to

another but I probably should not I got somebody at home, home, home, home It's been a long night here and a long night there And these long, long legs are damn near everywhere Hold up now You look

another I will stay true I will stay true , I will stay true I got these fresh eyes, never seen you before like this My God, you're beautiful It's like the first time when we opened the door'Fore we got used to usual It might seem superficial Stereotypical, man You dress up just a little and I'm like, "Oh, damn"So suddenly, I'm in love with a stranger I can't believe that she's mine Now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes So suddenly, I'm in love with a stranger I can't believe that she's mine, yeah And now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes Appreciation, well, it comes and it goes But I, I'll ride that wave with you It's human nature to miss what's under your nose'Til you, 'til you remind a fool Maybe all of this is simple My heart's unconditional, yeah You dress up just a little and I'm like, "Oh, damn"Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I've been grinding so long, been trying this shit for years And I got nothing to show, just climbing this rope right here And if there's a man upstairs, he kept bringing me rain But I've been sending up prayers and something's changed I think I finally found my hallelujah I've been waiting for this moment all my life Now all my dreams are coming true, yeah I've been waiting for this moment Feels good to be alive right about now Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now Hallelujah, let that bass line move ya, say hey And it's good to be alive right about now I was dead in the water, nobody wanted me I was old news, I went cold as cold could be But I kept throwing on coal tryna make that fire burn Sometimes you gotta get scars to get what you deserve I kept moving on and now I'm moving up Damn, I'm feeling blessed with all this love Right from the start, couldn't pull us apart, it just works Nobody else ever gets me as well on this earth Like rock and roll, Marshalls and Teles Mac and cheese, P B's and jellies Some things are better together, and that you and me-e Dude, I love you, bro, I love you Man, I love you You're my brother from another, 'nother mother You are my favorite, I'm not ashamed to admit Cause I do, dude, I do Dude, I love you, bro, I love you Man, I love you You're my homie, no one knows me like you know me Like the sun and the moon, all the best things comes in two What would I do without a friend like you W-w-w-w-what would I do Without a friend like you W-w-w-w-what would I do Without a friend like you Laughed and we cried when we're passing the time away Even our fights always end with a smile on our face Like black and white, keys on a Wurli Sounds just right when we're in harmony Some things are better together and that's you and me-eMy, my, my mother was a sunshine soldier Everyday was a dream come true She said that we were blessed by the breath deep inside us She could make the colors in the sky turn blue She said, "Honey, whatcha gonna  do today You're second guessing every single move you make You're definitely gonna have some very hard days But I'll be right here for you"And she said, "Before I go There is one thing you should know""I give love to all of my people All of my people need love, I give some I give love to all of my people All of my people need love, I give some I give love to all of my people All of my people need love, I give some'Cause in the end, the love we take's Got nothing on the love we make So give love, so give love, so give love"She, she said, "You're gonna be a light in a cold world You got extra love pumping up your veins"To my people feeling down and my people feeling empty I got so much of this love, I gotta give it away"You and I, against the world," that's what you told me That night, in the terminal as we were boarding And I know you meant it, holding my hand so tight as We flew, from Lafayette back to Pacific time And you lay your head on my shoulder Couple tears were shed over Arizona An emotional roller coaster, yeah We ride the highs and lows We ride the highs and lows You'll never be alone even when your world explodes'Cause after all the smoke clears, I will be right here I will be right here when the smoke clears I will be right here when the smoke clears And when I hit the wall back in December I took my hardest fall, but we fell together And we spent the weekend pacing the hotel room at The Westin in Dublin, never felt so close to youYou're not the type, type a girl To remain with a guy, with a guy too shy too afraid To say he'll give his heart to you forever I'm not the boy who will fall to his knees With his hands clasped tight beggin' beggin' you please To stay with him for worse or for better But I'm staring at you now There's no one else around I'm thinking you're the girl for me I'm just saying it's fine by me If you never leave And we can lay like this forever It's fine by me In the past I would try try hard to commit to a girl Wouldn't get too far It always somehow seemed to fall apart But with you, you, you I can see what I need I can dream realistically I knew that this was different from the start And it seems that every time we're eye to eye I can find another piece of you, that I don't wanna loseI'm gon' need you to raise your glass I don't care what you put in it Here's to nights that you can't take back We live hard, but we love to laugh We all thought that we'd get rich fast Hop the plane out for greener grass Found out the greenest cash Don't compare to the friends that last See, we won't forget where we came from The city won't change us We beat to the same drum No, we won't forget where we came from The city can't change us We beat to the same drum, the same drum La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-doe It don't matter where we go We always find our way back home La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-doe It don't matter where we go We always find our way back home
