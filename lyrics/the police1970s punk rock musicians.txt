Every breath you take And every move you make Every bond you break Every step you take I'll be watching you Every single day And every word you say Every game you play Every night you stay I'll be watching you Oh, can't you see You belong to me How my poor heart aches With every step you take Every move you make And every vow you break Every smile you fake Every claim you stake I'll be watching youRoxanne You don't have to put on the red light Those days are over You don't have to sell your body to the night Roxanne You don't have to wear that dress tonight Walk the streets for money You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right Roxanne You don't have to put on the red light Roxanne You don't have to put on the red light Put on the red light Put on the red light Put on the red light Put on the red light Put on the red light, oh I loved you since I knew you I wouldn't talk down to ya I have to tell you just how I feel I won't share you with another boy I know my mind is made up So put away your makeup Told you once I won't tell you again It's a bad wayJust a castaway, an island lost at sea, oh Another lonely day with no one here but me, oh More loneliness than any man could bear Rescue me before I fall into despair, oh I'll send an S OS to the world I'll send an S OS to the world I hope that someone gets my I hope that someone gets my I hope that someone gets my Message

in a bottle Message in a bottle Young teacher, the subject of schoolgirl fantasy She wants him so badly, knows what she wants to be Inside her there's longing, this girl's an open page Bookmarking, she's so close now This girl is half his age Don't stand, don't stand so Don't stand so close to me Don't stand, don't stand so Don't stand so close to me Her friends are so jealous You know how bad girls get Sometimes it's not so easy to be the teacher's pet Temptation, frustration so bad it makes him cry Wet bus stop, she's waiting his car is warm and dry Don't stand, don't stand so Don't stand so close to me Don't stand, don't stand so Don't stand so close to meThough I've tried before to tell her Of the feelings I have for her in my heart Every time that I come near her I just lose my nerve, as I've done from the start Every little thing she does is magic Everything she does just turns me on Even though my life before was tragic Now I know my love for her goes on Do I have to tell the story Of a thousand rainy days since we first met It's a big enough umbrella But it's always me that ends up getting wet Every little thing she does is magic Everything she does just turns me on Even though my life before was tragic Now I know my love for her goes on I resolved to call her up A thousand times a day And ask her if she'll marry me In some old-fashioned way But my silent fears have gripped me Long before I reach the phone Long before my tongue has tripped me Must I always be alone Oh, oh, oh Another suburban family morning Grandmother screaming at the wall We have to shout above The din of our Rice Krispies We can't hear anything at all Mother chants her litany Of boredom and frustration But we know all her suicides are fake Daddy only stares into the distance There's only so much more that he can take Many miles away Something crawls from the slime At the bottom of a dark Scottish lake Another industrial ugly morning The factory belches filth into the sky He walks unhindered Through the picket lines today He doesn't think to wonder whyYou consider me the young apprentice Caught between the Scylla and Charybdis Hypnotized by you if I should linger Staring at the ring around your finger I have only come here seeking knowledge Things they would not teach me of in college I can see the destiny you sold Turn into a shining band of gold I'll be wrapped around your finger I'll be wrapped around your finger Mephistopheles is not your name I know what you're up to just the same I will listen hard to your tuition You will see it come to its fruition I'll be wrapped around your finger I'll be wrapped around your finger Devil and the deep blue sea behind me Vanish in the air, you'll never find me I will turn your face to alabaster When you find your servant is your masterEvery breath you take And every move you make Every bond you break Every step you take I'll be watching you Every single day And every word you say Every game you play Every night you stay I'll be watching you Oh, can't you see You belong to me How my poor heart aches With every step you take Every move you make And every vow you break Every smile you fake Every claim you stake I'll be
