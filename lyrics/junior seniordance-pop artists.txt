me down to the parallel city Where the music's loud and the boys are pretty I wanna go, I really wanna go But excuse me, honey, I'm late for the show A break it, break it, break it up Girls say A break it down Boys say A break it up Girls say A break it down, yeah!Well you can say we commit the perfect rhyme Looking for a hi-fi moment in time Searching high, we've been searching low Cuz nobody
