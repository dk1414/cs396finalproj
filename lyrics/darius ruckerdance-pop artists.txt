Heading down south to the land of the pines I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights I made it down the coast in seventeen hours Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel Rock me, mama, any way you feel Hey, mama, rock me Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain Rock me, mama, like a southbound train Hey, mama, rock me Running from the cold up in New England I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel Rock me, mama, any way you feel Hey, mama, rock me Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain Rock me, mama, like a southbound train Hey, mama, rock meWhat if I told you about my little nothing town The two room house where I came from The man that I got my name from I don't even know where he is now What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me What if I told you there's no fixing me'Cause everybody's already tried Would you stay  Would you leave I could wait, it'll all come out eventually If I told you all the stupid things I've done I blamed on being young But I was old enough to know, I know If I told you the mess that I can be When there's no one there to see Would you look the other way, could you love me anyway What if I told you I don't plan on staying here My dreams are a million miles away And I know your family's gonna want you to stay You know what  I don't blame themYou say you never danced to a dashboard singin' R.E.M  under summer stars Never leaned back on a jet black Chevy, blowing smoke rings in the dark You don't want to be a rumor, girl, and I feel just the same Yeah, I know that you don't know me well but we can make that change When was the last time you did something for the first time Yeah, let yourself go, follow that feeling Maybe something new is what you're needing Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive When was the last time you did something for the first time Say you never drank from the bottle of some two dollar wine, run barefoot through the mud Never had the right kiss stolen from your lips, while you watched the sun come up Well, I know your friends are watching and they probably disapprove But give me just half a chance, girl, I'm daring you When was the last time you did something for the first time Yeah, let yourself go, baby, follow that feeling Maybe something new is what you're needing Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive When was the last time you did something for the first time Got a baby girl sleeping in my bedroom And her mama laughing in my arms There's the sound of rain on the rooftop And the game's about to start I don't really know how I got here But I'm sure glad that I did And it's crazy to think that one little thing Could've changed all of it Maybe it didn't turn out like I planned Maybe that's why I'm such, such a lucky man For every stoplight I didn't make Every chance I did or I didn't take All the nights I went too far All the girls that broke my heart All the doors that I had to close All the things I knew but I didn't know Thank God for all I missed Cause it led me here to ThisI grew up just west of the tracks Holding me to hold me back Around your door she's calling out my name I come in at 5 A MAnd she is waiting for me She said, "Where have you been ", I said, "I was out!"She said, "You're no good cause you're running without love"And I'm going straight to hell Just like my momma said I'm going straight to hell I'm going straight to hell Just like my momma said I'm going straight to hell Oh and I'm gonna burn it down, baby The black widow and the ladies man Met down at the laundromat And tried to make me understand And just then, her mother bursts in And said, "You're the son of that bitch in the wind Get out of my house and hit the road"And I kept falling like a Rolling Stones' songHe didn't have to wake up He'd been up all night Lying there in bed listening To his new born baby cry He makes a pot of coffee He splashes water on his face His wife gives him a kiss and says It is going to be O KIt won't be like this for long One day we'll look back laughing At the week we brought her home This phase is going to fly by So baby just hold on It won't be like this for long Four years later bout four thirty She's crawling in their bed And when he drops her off at preschool She's clinging to his leg The teacher peels her off of him He says what can I do She says now do not you worry This will only last a week or twoI know where I wanna go tonight Been thinking about it all day I been waiting on your paradise I know that you know the way I let the world outside our window Do whatever it's gonna do We'll have a body and soul revival Right here in this room When your lips touch mine I'm born again If I never get to heaven, hell, I've already been Lead me to salvation, girl, I'm down on my knees Turn the lights off, slide your jeans off and put your hands on me Chase your shadow through the secret garden You'll be waiting for me there, there I could whisper hallelujah, baby But I don't have a prayer And only you can save me From the crazy that you make me When your lips touch mine I'm born again If I never get to heaven, hell, I've already been Lead me to salvation, girl, I'm down on my knees Turn the lights off, slide your jeans off and put your hands on meI woke up again this mornin'And wouldn't you know it pourin' rain I went and burned a pot of coffee And like us I poured it down the drain'Cause I didn't know I needed you so And letting you go was wrong And baby I know you got your radio on So this is my my bad, come back song I know I said I wouldn't miss you But now I'm sayin' I'm a fool You're on the feel good side of leavin'And I'm the backside of a mule And I didn't know I needed you so And letting you go was wrong And baby I know you got your radio on So this is my so sad, come back song And now I'm laying down without you In this king size empty bed And I wish I had my arms around you But I'll just dream of you insteadIf you think I could ever go a day without you Five minutes without thinkin' about you Don't And if you wonder if it scares me Thinkin' about forever with you, baby I can tell you, baby, it don't, oh'Cause every single mornin'My eyes fall open on you It's like my dreams keep goin'On and on and on, it don't Matter what we're doin'As long as I'm with you, and I can't imagine anything I couldn't love you through the bad days There's gonna be mistakes But, baby, I'm here to stay And if you think that could change Don't Stop makin' me late for work Wakin' me up without sayin' a word Ooh, don't'Cause when you whisper in my ear Everything I wanna hear I know you know, I need to go But you're the reason that I don'tMmm that breeze feels good, don't it Feet up on the cooler Them tunes pouring out of that sliding rear window Laugh to the beat of that tape deck radio Mmm it's a heaven on earth moment Got a good thing going Round and round like the wheels of this night It's a singing along kiss, close your eyes I don't like this living, I love it Sweet magnolia blue skies up above it I don't call Carolina just a place I visit I call Carolina home I don't like drinking beer, I love it On the back porch swinging with my honey Life's too short just to like it so you better get to loving This living before it's gone Life's too short Better get to living if the beer's ice cold You better get to sipping if the song's in the air Get you out a lighter if the party's rocking You pull an all-nighter cause life's too short Mmm that six string's strumming, ain't it This scene's all God painted I'm soaking you in while you're soaking it in It's like a movie baby, ain't it  Oh don't waste it
