You must think that I'm stupid You must think that I'm a fool You must think that I'm new to this But I have seen this all before I'm never gonna let you close to me Even though you mean the most to me'Cause every time I open up, it hurts So I'm never gonna get too close to you Even when I mean the most to you In case you go and leave me in the dirt But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry And every time you walk out, the less I love you Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true I'm way too good at goodbyes I'm way too good at goodbyes I know you're thinkin' I'm heartless I know you're thinkin' I'm cold I'm just protectin' my innocence I'm just protectin' my soulGuess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man These nights never seem to go to plan I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand Oh, won't you stay with me 'Cause you're all I need This ain't love, it's clear to see But darling, stay with me Why am I so emotional No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control And deep down, I know this never works But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt Oh, won't you stay with me 'Cause you're all I need This ain't love, it's clear to see But darling, stay with me Oooh, oooh Oooh, ooohMummy don't know Daddy's getting hot At the Body Shop Doing something unholy He like it, like it, yeah He like it, like it, yeah He like it, like it, yeah He like it, like it, yeah A lucky, lucky girl She got married to a boy like you She'd kick you out if she ever, ever knew'Bout all the **** you tell me that you do Dirty, dirty boy You know everyone is talkin' on the scene I hear them whisperin' 'bout the places that you've been And how you don't know how to keep your business clean Mummy don't know Daddy's getting hot At the Body Shop Doin' something unholy He's sat back while she's droppin' it She be poppin' it Yeah, she put it down slowly Oh-ee-oh-ee-oh, he left his kids at Ho-ee-oh-ee-ome so he can get that Mummy don't know Daddy's getting hot At the Body Shop Doin' something unholy You and me, we made a vow For better or for worse I can't believe you let me down But the proof's in the way it hurts For months on end, I've had my doubts Denyin' every tear I wish this would be over now But I know that I still need you here And you say I'm crazy'Cause you don't think I know what you've done But when you call me "baby"I know I'm not the only one You've been so unavailable Now, sadly, I know why Your heart is unobtainable Even though Lord knows you kept mine And you say I'm crazy'Cause you don't think I know what you've done But when you call me "baby"I know I'm not the only oneI'm young and I'm foolish, I've made bad decisions I block out the news, turn my back on religion Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat naïve I've made it this far on my own But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher I lift up my head and the world is on fire There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones And I just don't know what to say Maybe I'll pray, pray Maybe I'll pray I have never believed in you, no But I'm gonna pray You won't find me in church Readin' the Bible I am still here and I'm still your disciple I'm down on my knees, I'm beggin' you, please I'm broken, alone, and afraid I'm not a saint, I'm more of a sinner I don't wanna lose, but I fear for the winners When I try to explain, the words run away That's why I am stood here todayAre you drunk enough Not to judge what I'm doin’?Are you high enough To excuse that I'm ruined 'Cause I’m ruined Is it late enough For you to come and stay over 'Cause we're free to love So tease me, ooh I make no promises, I can't do golden rings But I'll give you everything Magic is in the air, there ain't no science here So come get your everything I make no promises, I can't do golden rings But I'll give you everything Magic is in the air, there ain’t no science here So come get your everything Tonight Is it loud enough ’Cause my body is callin' for you, callin’ for you I need someone To do the things that I do, mhm I'm heatin' up Energy's takin’ control I'm speedin' up My heartbeat's dancin' aloneYes I do, I believe That one day I will be where I was Right there, right next to you And it's hard, the days just seem so dark The moon, and the stars are nothing without you Your touch, your skin, where do I begin No words can explain the way I'm missing you Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside These tears, they tell their own story Told me not to cry when you were gone But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong Can I lay by your side, next to you, you And make sure you're all right I'll take care of you I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight I'm reaching out to you Can you hear my call This hurt that I've been through I'm missing you, missing you like crazyI'm done hatin' myself for feelin'I'm done cryin' myself awake I gotta leave and start the healin'But when you move like that, I just wanna stay What have I become now Lookin' through your phone now Oh now, love to you is just a game Look what I have done now Dialling up the numbers on you I don't want my heart to break Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me All that shame and all that danger I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me All that fear and all that pressure I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight Love will keep you up tonightI've been here before But always hit the floor I've spent a lifetime runnin'And I always get away But with you, I'm feeling somethin'That makes me wanna stay I'm prepared for this I never shoot to miss But I feel like a storm is comin'If I'm gonna make it through the day Then there's no more use in runnin'This is somethin' I gotta face If I risk it all Could you break my fall How do I live  How do I breathe When you're not here, I'm suffocating I wanna feel love run through my blood Tell me, is this where I give it all up For you, I have to risk it all'Cause the writing's on the wallMy mother said I'm too romantic She said, "You're dancing in the movies"I almost started to believe her Then I saw you and I knew Maybe it's 'cause I got a little bit older Maybe it's all that I've been through I'd like to think it's how you lean on my shoulder And how I see myself with you I don't say a word But still, you take my breath and steal the things I know There you go, saving me from out of the cold Fire on fire would normally kill us But this much desire, together, we're winners They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me And look in my eye You are perfection, my only direction It's fire on fire, mmm It's fire on fire
