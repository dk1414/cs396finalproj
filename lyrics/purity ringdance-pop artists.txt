Get a little closer, let fold Cut open my sternum, and pull My little ribs around you The lungs of me be under, under you I'll cut the soft pockets, let bleed Over the rocky cliffs that you leave To peer over and not forget what feet are Splitting threads of thunder over me That I might see with my chest and sink Into the edges round you Into the lakes and quarries that brink On all the edges round you, round you, round you Get a little closer, let fold Cut open my sternum, and pull My little ribs around you The lungs of me be crowns over you Get a little closer, let fold Cut open my sternum, and pull My little ribs around you The lungs of me be under, under youYou said, you said"Turn the lights down, I wanna be alone"I read your head away I couldn't stand how it pleaded I needed to take Take a break, take me down, take me down there I wanna stare at the tears, how they watered your years Take a break, take me down, take me down there I wanna stare at your tears, how they I, I, I lied, now I'm lying awake I, I, I cried 'til my body ache I, I, I lied, now I'm lying awake I, I, I cried 'til my body ache You sweat, and you bled I couldn't look cause your body, your body would shake And you feared a lonely death Like a lake leaves you alone in her depths Take a break, take me down, take me down there I wanna stare at the tears, how they watered your years Take a break, take me down, take me down there I wanna stare at your tears, how theyHey, hey, pray, pray, pay Hey, hey, pray, pray, pay Hey, hey, pray, pray, pay Hey, hey, pray Tell me that you wanna move me 'round like that I will watch your lips curve in a smooth combat Make your way in through my tears and I'll relax If you're the truest one, I'm gonna make you a season Climb up in my rattling spine and I'll contract Tell me I'm the only one and I'll move back If you see your daydreams in me, they'll not lack What's been weighted in me, I'll make you quake with reason Watching me is like watching a fire take your eyes from you Hope it isn't repetition Though that's the only thing that keeps and takes you Watching me is like watching a fire take your eyes from you Hope it isn't repetition Though that's the only thing that keeps and takes you I can feel your knees sinking into the bed Searching in my dark eyes to break what’s been said There’s a wake of grace, hunting your soreness down There's a light in my skin that's been dimmed I'mma dig you up and give you what I took Pull you up and tuck you in and make you look I'ma smooth your shoulders down and calm what's shook It was all forlorn, if only for a seasonBegin again, begin again, begin again I've been watching your kindness keep A lonely company Look at the fire and think of me I've been watching you creep Around my wandering feet Trying for years to flee I need not one thing more Oh, wrap the ground around Your gentle winding mind Oh, guard the pounding sound Breathe in your fiery air Oh, wrap the ground around Give back an hungrier stare Oh, guard the pounding sound You be the moon, I'll be the earth And when we burst Start over, oh, darling Begin again, begin again, begin again You be the moon, I'll be the earth And when we burst Start over, oh, darling Begin again, begin again, begin againGreen, green thunder and the loud, loud rain Lead our woes asunder'Neath the proud, proud veins Of trains let bleed the gunmen of our Pumping earthly hearts Wean our joys in plunder Peel our shining teeth Bid our hold on happiness Beat weighty tests with lofty cries Lofty cries with trembling thighs Weepy chests with weepy sighs Weepy skin with trembling thighs You must be hovering over yourself Watching us drip on each other's sides Dear brother collect all the liquids off Of the floor Use your oily fingers Make a paste Let it form Let it seep through your sockets and ears Into your precious ruptured skull Let it seep let it keep you from us Patiently heal you Patiently unreel youI came down over The sleepy mountains where Our wide toes plunged into The weeping shale to tear our Skin up off from the bottom Leaves our ankles bare Don't just wander back and forth And leave it Build it into pinnacles and shrines of some Some ghastly predicament of mine you'll find Leaves us plastered to a bed of hairs with Me all coiled up near the bottom with my chest un-bared Oh but dear the sky is low Gather up its harm and gods with grateful arms Oh but dear the sky is low Gather up its harm and gods with grateful arms Oh but dear the sky is low watch Fluent sea men rig their rudders so they'll Graze it with their wind arrows'Tis in the fathoms that-that they brush below-lowI had a feeling you broke and the smoke filled you up I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you You have a mind that makes sight of the weight you pick up I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you Again, again, again, I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you I wasn't, I wasn't Again, again, again, I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you I wasn't, I wasn't There is a color that shines through your skin Like the moon on the wind, when I dare bear you in The night is full on behalf of your evaded mask And the rings 'round your eyes We are stranger than earth, with the seasons misled Stronger than her moods When our parts parted, she bled and bled and bled I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you Again, again, again, I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you I wasn't, I wasn't Again, again, again, I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you I wasn't, I wasn'tShe lost her voice down by the river Screamin' for courage to take oceans under She read your mind and called it a terror Misplacin' her sleep to keep the world nearer Don't forget the way she pushed the water inside Wading through the spirits like a flood on the floor Don't forget, forget, don't forget, forget Don't forget, forget, don't forget, forget I'll miss keepin' you I hope you're sleepin', too I hope you're home I hope you're home She took your face and called it her choir Knitting lace out of lashes and powdered with ashes She held her hands and told you to wonder How you'd fit in the land if the waves held you under Whisper, whimper on I Won't forget to close your eyes for you I'll sing before you lie down, down And push your sleep along I'll sink below the ground Find the weeping, wailing calls you echo in I'll build a house around you Stir a moat until you drown, down I'll whisk away your heartsigh And bury it in mine I'll whisk away your heartsigh And bury it in mine Only, lonely, hidden breath beneath the floor Only, only, where your tears drip from the drawers Only, lonely, hid the morning from the stars Only, only, weeping glimmers in the dark I can hear your back crackin'O'er the sky so you could wear it Thunder whispered low, so You could bear it inI could build a big machine Draw pictures for the walls Hang up all my fragile thoughts Displayed that you might see A space, a drop, a cloth, a comfort of Frailties in me A space, a drop, a cloth, a comfort of Frailties Baby, why don't you see, see my sea Make slow, get inside and pull on my sea Get inside and build your castle into me Baby, why don't you see, see my sea The moon is dead but she still pulls on me Get inside and pull on my sea Take time, make slow Where have I been  Why can't you see me Take time, make slow Where have I been  Why can't you see me I could give you petty rhymes Of worlds that I contrive They're in my sleep, my dreams I speak them slow, so you can read And not stand back and stare and fear Foolish devouring things And not stand back and stare and fear Foolish devouring
