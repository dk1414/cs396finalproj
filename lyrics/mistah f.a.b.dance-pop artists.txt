invisible children I tell you about divisible children I'm talking kids that die in my city Rest in peace to how many 2-year olds That get killed for violence in silence But nobody could silence that So while we worried about what's going on In other countries, let's worry about where I live at You know, in America, in Oakland Where a little nigga's 13, already smoking Weed or coke, it don't matter Snow, gasoline, just to make their brain matter And splatter, so while they're worried about Kony The world media playing us like Sony You say this going on, shit been going on for years Been happening in many countries in Africa kid!From Uganda to Rwanda to the Congo Sierra Leone and many other places that I go From Algeria to Liberia to Morocco To Egypt, to every other city where the blocks glow Gaddafi did it, everyone do it, that's what they do It's just what it is, Idi Amin, let's take it too I take you through some countries they don't take you through Young dudes renegades, rebellions is killing ooh My man told me the first man he killed was at 7 Was up in the war man, it's real True story, namsayin  Ain't nothing wrong with Kony But let's realize this media shit is phony Invisible children put off living Excuse me, I messed up.  they prey off sympathy This shit is touching my heart So I'll let you hear me mess up I'll tell you this a freestyle, now let's dress up Let's address the real facts, what they saying tho Give me some money to help these kids while we praying tho Thank God, it's a blessing, I appreciate you A hundred percent of your donations going to the Nation OK, so why y'all still doing feed the children commercials With flies all over their face Little dudes skinny but still fat Cause their ribs sticking out It's nothing to eat, so imagine that While this white man walking around with clothes And he's feeling good, holding these babies on his lap Like it's real hood!Like they feel good If you that hungry, if you that interested Why don't you give up your money You filming commercials They're out there, really in it hurt tho This is what you talking about So invisible children are money you making Off donations at a non-profit organization Help feed your organization The salary you making is the money that you taking While you saying that you giving people blessings Blessing's vacant  These little kids is crazy These little people and these renegades and rebellions is raping These girls is growing up with A ID SNow they putting needles and blades Inside their vigaginal Or vaginal, however it go You know, imagine it tho!And this ain't no imaginal flow It's real life, it's what I'm telling you So when these dudes rape em They are cutting their dicks off, this shit is real Serious talk  Y'all talking about what's going on Kony ain't even in Uganda, he's gone!He not there, I just want the natural resources and oil So you can kill him and then have a reason to coil So people won't say "Aww they killed that man!"Propaganda blew up, the whole media expand So it won't be crazy when you manufacture this assassination So when they kill this man This nation, other nations won't try to take a stand And you can get away with it Deploy, then employ new people from your land Open up an American embassy and take over the whole land Now more money is generated from oil Now more kids are worried about the things that you coil What you teaching, so the natural resources That you trying to take away You make away, hopefully one day We can realize what they do to us This money that we sending not us, they wanna
