I was a quick wet boy Diving too deep for coins All of your street light eyes Wide on my plastic toys Then when the cops closed the fair I cut my long baby hair Stole me a dog-eared map And called for you everywhere Have I found you  Flightless bird Jealous, weeping Or lost you  American mouth Big pill looming Now I'm a fat house cat Nursing my sore blunt tongue Watching the warm poison rats Curl through the wide fence cracks Pissing on magazine photos Those fishing lures Thrown in the cold and clean Blood of Christ mountain streamPlease, remember me happily By the rosebush laughing With bruises on my chin, the time when We counted every black car passing Your house beneath the hill And up until someone caught us in the kitchen With maps, a mountain range, a piggy bank A vision too removed to mention But please, remember me fondly I heard from someone you're still pretty And then they went on to say That the pearly gates Had some eloquent graffiti Like "We'll meet again" and "Fuck the man"And "Tell my mother not to worry"And angels with their great handshakes Were always done in such a hurry And please, remember me that Halloween Making fools of all the neighbors Our faces painted white By midnight, we'd forgotten one another And when the morning came I was ashamed Only now it seems so silly That season left the world and then returned And now you're lit up by the citySay it's here where our pieces fall in place Any rain softly kisses us on the face Any wind means we're running We can sleep and see 'em coming Where we drift and call it dreaming We can weep and call it singing Where we break when our hearts are strong enough We can bow 'cause our music's warmer than blood Where we see enough to follow We can hear when we are hollow Where we keep the light we're given We can lose and call it living Where the sun isn't only sinking fast Every night knows how long it's supposed to last Where the time of our lives is all we have And we get a chance to say, before we ease away For all the love you've left behind You can have mine Say it's here where our pieces fall in place We can fear 'cause the feeling's fine to betray Where our water isn't hidden We can burn and be forgiven Where our hands hurt from healing We can laugh without a reasonI am thinking it's a sign That the freckles in our eyes are mirror images And when we kiss they're perfectly aligned And I have to speculate That God himself did make us into corresponding shapes Like puzzle pieces from the clay And true, it may seem like a stretch But it's thoughts like this that catch my troubled head when you're away When I am missing you to death When you are out there on the road For several weeks of shows and when you scan the radio I hope this song will guide you home They will see us waving from such great heights"Come down now," they'll say But everything looks perfect from far away"Come down now," but we'll stay I tried my best to leave This all on your machine but the persistent beat it Sounded thin upon listenin'And that frankly will not fly You will hear the shrillest highs and lowest lows with the windows down And this is guiding you homeShe says, "Wake up, it's no use pretending"I'll keep stealing, breathing her Birds are leaving over autumn's ending One of us will die inside these arms Eyes wide open Naked as we came One will spread our ashes 'round the yard She says, "If I leave before you, darling Don't you waste me in the ground"I lay smiling like our sleeping children One of us will die inside these arms Eyes wide open Naked as we came One will spread our ashes 'round the yardMother don't worry I killed the last snake that lived in the creek bed Mother don't worry I've got some money I saved for the weekend Mother, remember being so stern With that girl who was with me Mother, remember the blink of an eye When I breathed through your body So may the sunrise bring hope Where it once was forgotten Sons are like birds Flying upwards over the mountain Mother, I made it up From the bruise of a floor of this prison Mother, I lost it All of the fear of the Lord I was given Mother forget me Now that the creek drank the cradle you sang to Mother forgive me I sold your car for the shoes that I gave youA boy with a coin he found in the weeds With bullets and pages of trade magazines Close to a car that flipped on the turn When God left the ground to circle the world A girl with a bird she found in the snow Then flew up her gown and that's how she knows That God made her eyes for crying at birth Then left the ground to circle the Earth A boy with a coin he crammed in his jeans Then making a wish he tossed in the sea Walked to a town that all of us burn When God left the ground to circle the worldWill you say when I'm gone away"My lover came to me and we'd lay"?In rooms unfamiliar but until now, oh-oh-oh-oh Until now, oh-oh-oh-oh Until now Will you say to them when I'm gone"I loved your son for his sturdy arms"?We both learned to cradle then live without, oh-oh-oh-oh Live without, oh-oh-oh-oh Live without Will you say when I'm gone away"Your father's body was judgement day"?We both dove and rose to the riverside, oh-oh-oh-oh Riverside, oh-oh-oh-oh Riverside Will you say to me when I'm gone"Your face has faded but lingers on"?'Cause light strikes a deal with each coming night, oh-oh-oh-oh Coming night, oh-oh-oh-oh Coming night, oh-oh-oh-ohThere are times that walk from you Like some passing afternoon Summer warmed the open window of her honeymoon And she chose a yard to burn But the ground remembers her Wooden spoons, her children stir her Bougainvillea blooms There are things that drift away Like our endless numbered days Autumn blew the quilt right off the perfect bed she made And she's chosen to believe In the hymns her mother sings Sunday pulls its children from their piles of fallen leaves There are sailing ships that pass All our bodies in the grass Springtime calls her children 'til she lets them go at last And she's chosen where to be Though she's lost her wedding ring Somewhere near her misplaced jar of Bougainvillea seeds There are things we can't recall Blind as night that finds us all Winter tucks her children in, her fragile china dolls But my hands remember hers Rolling 'round the shaded ferns Naked arms, her secrets still like songs I'd never learnedGive me your hand The dog in the garden row is covered in mud And dragging your mother's clothes Cinder and smoke The snake in the basement Found the juniper shade The farmhouse is burning down Give me your hand And take what you will tonight I'll give it as fast And high as the flame will rise Cinder and smoke Some whispers around the trees The juniper bends As if you were listening Give me your hand Your mother is drunk As all the firemen shake A photo from father's arms Cinder and smoke You asked me to pray for rain With ash in your mouth You'll ask it to burn again
