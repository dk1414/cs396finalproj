Finished with my woman'Cause she couldn't help me with my mind People think I'm insane Because I am frowning all the time All day long I think of things But nothing seems to satisfy Think I'll lose my mind If I don't find something to pacify Can you help me Occupy my brain Oh yeah I need someone to show me The things in life that I can't find I can't see the things that make true happiness I must be blindI am Iron Man Has he lost his mind Can he see or is he blind Can he walk at all Or if he moves, will he fall Is he alive or dead Has he thoughts within his head We'll just pass him there Why should we even care He was turned to steel In the great magnetic field When he travelled time For the future of mankind Nobody wants him He just stares at the world Planning his vengeance That he will soon unfurlGenerals gathered in their masses Just like witches at black masses Evil minds that plot destruction Sorcerer of death's construction In the fields, the bodies burning As the war machine keeps turning Death and hatred to mankind Poisoning their brainwashed minds Oh, Lord, yeah Politicians hide themselves away They only started the war Why should they go out to fight They leave that all to the poor, yeah Time will tell on their power minds Making war just for fun Treating people just like pawns in chess Wait till their judgment day comes, yeahWhat is this that stands before me Figure in black which points at me Turn 'round quick and start to run Find out I'm the chosen one Oh, no!Big black shape with eyes of fire Tellin' people their desire Satan's sittin' there, he's smilin'Watches those flames get higher and higher Oh, no  No  Please, God, help me!Is it the end, my friend Satan's comin' 'round the bend People runnin' 'cause they're scared The people better go and beware No  No  Please, no Sing me a song, you're a singer Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil The Devil is never a maker The less that you give, you're a taker So, it's on and on and on It's Heaven and Hell Oh well, yeah The lover of life's not a sinner The ending is just a beginner The closer you get to the meaning The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming So, it's on and on and on Oh, it's on and on and on It goes on and on and on Heaven and Hell, I can tell Fool, foolOh yeah Some people say my love cannot be true Please believe me, my love, and I'll show you I will give you those things you thought unreal The sun, the moon, the stars, all bear my seal Oh yeah Follow me now and you will not regret Leaving the life you led before we met You are the first to have this love of mine Forever with me till the end of time Your love for me has just got to be real Before you know the way I'm going to feel I'm going to feel I'm going to feel Oh yeah Now, I have you with me under my power Our love grows stronger now with every hour Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am My name is Lucifer, please take my handI feel unhappy, I feel so sad I've lost the best friend that I ever had She was my woman, I loved her so But it's too late now, I've let her go I'm going through changes I'm going through changes We shared the years, we shared each day In love, together, we found the way But soon, the world had its evil way My heart was blinded, love went astray I'm going through changes I'm going through changes It took so long to realise And I can still hear her last goodbyes Now, all my days are filled with tears Wish I could go back and change these yearsWe sail through endless skies Stars shine like eyes, the black night sighs The moon in silver dreams Pours down in beams, light of the night The earth, a purple blaze Of sapphire haze in orbit always While down below the trees Bathed in cool breeze, silver starlight Breaks dawn from night And so, we pass on by The crimson eye of great God Mars As we travel the universeYou've seen right through distorted eyes, you know you had to learn The execution of your mind, you really had to turn The race is run, the book is read, the end begins to show The truth is out, the lies are old, but you don't want to know Nobody will ever let you know When you ask the reasons why They just tell you that you're on your own Fill your head all full of lies The people who have crippled you, you wanna see them burn The gates of life have closed on you, and there's just no return You're wishing that the hands of doom could take your mind away And you don't care if you don't see again the light of day Nobody will ever let you know When you ask the reasons why They just tell you that you're on your own Fill your head all full of lies, you bastards *Coughing*Alright now Won't you listen When I first met you, didn't realize I can't forget you or your surprise You introduced me to my mind And left me wanting you and your kind Oh, yeah!I love you Oh, you know it My life was empty, forever on a down Until you took me, showed me around My life is free now, my life is clear I love you, sweet leaf Though you can't hear Oh, yeah!Come on now Try it out Straight people don't know What you're about They put you down and shut you out You gave to me a new belief And soon the world Will love you, sweet leaf Oh, yeah, baby
