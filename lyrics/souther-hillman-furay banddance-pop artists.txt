Here I go again, it's all right Full moons grown to brighten the night I've been lookin', now seein' the light It's sure shinin' bright, yea Well, honey, believe in it, it bein' free mm Nothin' to love's like nothin' to be You've got once a lifetime To see just how much of your dream Honey, to feel like fallin' in love, just to know Honey, to feel like fallin' in love Turnin' home, runnin' free as the wind Stretchin' my stride, wanna hold you again Well, it's time to be taken in Let me know where I've been, yea Honey, to feel like fallin' in love, just to know Don't you know what it feels like fallin' in love Honey to feel like fallin' in love Turnin' home, runnin' free as the wind Stretchin' my stride, wanna hold you again Well it's time to be taken in Let me know where I've beenLife ain't so easy in this border town, it's the dope and the nightlife And there's no place you'd really want to hang around but I think I might Good looking women in this border town and most of them easy But some of the dudes that are walking around, well they're just pretty greasy The thing is, it bothers you sometimes Looking into that old familiar shine Your baby was mine before And you don't seem to mind, what's more She came singin' into border town, a little girl with a big dreams Now she's covered in pearls and a long white gown, riding a limousine Oh there's a dozen old ladies who were just like that, sometime back in the thirties And now they're lonesome and looking for something to do, they got dirty Because when they don't love you anymore Can you live on your memories And when your good friends ain't hanging at your door Like a family of strangers, run in misery Life ain't so easy in this border town, too much dope and too much running around And you'd never even hear it if the truth went down in border town And when you're beaten in border town, there's no place else to go Throw your dream in the ocean and start to row away from border town Border town, away from border town Border town, bye bye border town Border town, border town, border town, border townHeavenly fire, cold dark rain I'm feeling so low, won't you play it again There'll be tears of sorrow, tears of strife Running, hiding through the long hours of night Hard to live, easy to die Makes you want to get down on your knees and cry How many times have you felt this way How many times have you heard them say It's a heavenly fire, cold dark rain I'm feeling so low, won't you play it again Tears of sorrow, tears of strife Running, hiding through the long hours of night Lived the life you sang about Carried me through when I had my doubts Now there's an emptiness inside of me All I've got left is your memory Tired and weary, you're not alone Still searching for the way back home Further on we'll meet again someday These are the last words that I heard you say It's a heavenly fire, cold dark rain I'm feeling so low, won't you play it again There'll be tears of sorrow, tears of strife Running, hiding through the long hours of nightPoor old Tom, living on the hill Says he wants to quit but I know he never will The bottle's his ticket to an early grave Nothing you can do, nothing you can say except he's ...Safe at home, safe at home Baby, stop crying, got to leave him alone You'll be safe at home, safe at home Mama, won't you call me on the telephone Oh, what ever happened to the

Baby, stop crying, got to leave him alone You'll be safe at home, safe at home Mama, won't you call me on the telephone  All right Well, I know what you mean and it's driving me crazy She hasn't come home, everything looking hazy Come in a hurry, fall far behind You can't love a woman, gonna tease your mind and you'll be ...Safe at home, safe at home Baby, stop crying, got to leave him alone You'll be safe at home, safe at home Mama, won't you call me on the telephone There ain't nothin' at all like the way I feel tonight The  love of my lady makes it all right Her  love light is shinin' on in the mornin', the glow is understood Yes, it's been a long time with me feelin' this good I thought nobody could Believe  me, I know Let  your love show, let yourself go Believe me Words  of the sweetest love song are yours and mine to share The saddest of all, you know, is when nobody cares Blind eyes that stare thinkin' of love, sweet love or maybe days gone by I've got my warmest dream, your star in the sky, a light to go by, yeah Let  your love show, let yourself go Believe me There ain't nothin' at all like the way I feel tonight It's been a long time feeling this good for nobody could, oh Let your love show, let yourself go Let your love show, let yourself go Let your love show, let yourself go Believe meRunning high, running low, it's down the road we go And  it's hard, hard time Can't  you see where we been  You know we can't do that again But it's hard, hard times Through the long dark night we kept our hopes held high Hopin'  to find what we'd all been prayin' for On  a pathway filled with lies, we still manage to get by But it's hard, hard times And  it's a run for the money, run down to the show to rock 'n' roll After all these years of tryin'Tell me is it really worth it all to rise and fall And it all goes by so fast, it hardly ever lasts And  there's always someone who wants more And this feeling deep inside, I've tried so long to hide But it's hard, hard time Running high, running low and it's down the road we go And it's hard, hard time Can't you see where we been  You know we can't do that again But it's hard, hard times Gonna be hard, hard timesYou don't want to hear it but the words in my mouth You don't wanna know it so I'll try not to shout But I've been lonelier with you than I was without And now there's nothing to say but goodbye You keep going crazy Well, you may never know why But if you leave it to me, oh baby we're gonna see You just take it easy and don't cry now Well, you don't wanna see it but the moon's in your eyes And you don't wanna know you've been living a lie I use to love you but baby the good has gone by We've been here for so long And we could make it easy Baby, pretty soon when I'm gone Well, you can open your eyes and have a good cry But say goodbye, tell me goodbye Say a pretty goodbye Baby, you could be gone with a smile on your face Instead of letting those good tears go to waste It's your life, don't look back You know nothing's been taken You can close your eyes, what will I Everybody is mistaken sometimesIf I say to you I just can't get through Apathy, it's killin' me First it comes and goes, then it just grows and grows I'm findin' out I got a heart in doubt Must it be a trend, do you find it hard to bend Been seein' it come, think I'll get on the run'Cause one thing is for sure, the changes do occur And what with blind man's bluff, well I got me enough Lovin' somethin', feelin' nothin' ain't no way to go You just never know who you love, you're thinkin' of Put nothin' above the flight of the dove She'll be long gone, long gone She's got a reason to fly like a star in the sky Can't you hear her now cryin' goodbye She ain't a woman to lie, is that a tear in your eye If it's harder now than it was then how Can it be, I can't wait, you see Once upon a time, learnin' paid the fine You can scream and yell but some you can't tell Lovin' somethin', feelin' nothin' ain't no way to go You just never know who you love, you're thinkin' of Put nothin' above the flight of the doveYou want to make up the rules as you go You think he plays too rough But you could have all the luck in the world And man, it might not be enough He's got a star on his shoulder You see it shining But you can see it's a cheat The heartbreaker, he's a hard one to beat It makes you mad to see him win But the girls keep comin' around He plays dirty and he plays for keeps But he's got that magic sound A song and a suitcase And a rodeo smile A lifewrecker Just a picture of style Your lady loves him, she's waitin' in school I guess  he's everything you want to be But then how you gonna make him look like a fool He's got a vision you can't even seeWhen the moon blows 'round your door and water burns like wine The line between your life and none has grown a little far Lonely one  sometimes everything's wrong You're all alone  and the night's so long Deep, dark and dreamless night Shadows that don't look right Deep, dark and dreamless nights You're not the only one Children all get scared at night, and run away to dream We've grown so fast and gone so far but oh how near it seems For the lonely one  you're just breaking my heart all alone you could die in the dark Deep, dark and dreamless nights Shadows that don't look right Deep, dark and dreamless nights Oh, lonely one, you're not the only one Weeping like a whippoorwill and I know these are lonely days But you can spend your life in tears and never have your way Lonely one  you see I know what it means to be all alone and losing your dream Deep, dark and dreamless nights Shadows that don't look right Deep, dark and dreamless nights Oh, lonely one, you're not the only one
