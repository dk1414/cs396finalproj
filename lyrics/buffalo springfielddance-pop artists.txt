There's something happening here But what it is ain't exactly clear There's a man with a gun over there A-telling me I got to beware I think it's time we stop Children, what's that sound Everybody look what's going down There's battle lines being drawn And nobody's right if everybody's wrong Young people speaking their minds Are gettin' so much resistance from behind It's time we stop Hey, what's that sound Everybody look what's going down What a field day for the heat A thousand people in the street Singing songs and a-carryin' signs Mostly say, "Hooray for our side" Oh, hello, Mr  Soul, I dropped by to pick up a reason For the thought that I caught that my head is the event of the season Why in crowds just a trace of my face could seem so pleasin'I'll cop out to the change, but a stranger is putting the tease on I was down on a frown when the messenger brought me a letter I was raised by the praise of a fan who said I upset her Any girl in the world could have easily known me better She said, "You're strange, but don't change," and I let her In a while, will the smile on my face turn to plaster Stick around while the clown who is sick does the trick of disaster For the race of my head and my face is moving much faster Is it strange I should change  I don't know, why don't you ask her Is it strange I should change  I don't know, why don't you ask her Is it strange I should change  I don't know, why don't you ask her Is it strange I should change  I don't know, why don't you ask her Is it strange I should change  I don't know, why don't you ask her There you stood on the edge of your feather Expecting to fly While I laughed, I wondered whether I could wave goodbye Knowing that you'd gone By the summer, it was healing We had said goodbye All the years we'd spent with feeling Ended with a cry Babe, ended with a cry Babe, ended with a cry I tried so hard to stand As I stumbled and fell to the ground So hard to laugh as I fumbled And reached for the love I'd found Knowing it was gone If I ever lived without you Now you know I died If I ever said I loved you Now you know I tried Babe, now you know I tried Babe, now you know I tried BabeListen to my bluebird laugh She can't tell you why Deep within her heart, you see She knows only crying, just crying Yeah There she sits, aloft at perch Strangest color blue Flying is forgotten now Thinks only of you, just you, oh yeah So get all those blues Must be a thousand hues And be just differently used You just know You sit there mesmerized By the depth of her eyes That you can't categorize She got soul, she got soul She got soul, she got soul Do you think she loves you Do you think at all Oh, hello Mr  Soul, I dropped by to pick up a reason For the thought that I caught that my head is the event of the season The lights turned on and the curtain fell down And when it was over, it felt like a dream They stood at the stage door and begged for a scream The agents had paid for the black limousine That waited outside in the rain Did you see them  Did you see them Did you see them in the river They were there to wave to you Could you tell that the empty-quivered Brown-skinned Indian on the banks That were crowded and narrow Held a broken arrow Eighteen years of American dream He saw that his brother had sworn on the wall He hung up his eyelids and ran down the hall His mother had told him a trip was a fall And don't mention babies at all Did you see him  Did you see him There's a woman that you ought to know And she's coming, singing soft and low Singing rock and roll, she's a joy to know'Neath the shadow of a soothing hand I am free there just to make my plans Dream of faraway lands, anything close at hand And she will follow me wide, do you know Familiar places she's been by that I know Could it be she don't have to try And tomorrow she's a friend of mine And the sorrow, I see her face is lined She's no longer blind, she's just hard to findOoh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh When the dream came I held my breath with my eyes closed I went insane, like a smoke ring day When the wind blows Now, I won't be back 'til later on If I do come back at all But you know me And I miss you, now Ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh In a strange game I saw myself as you knew me When the change came And you had a chance to see through me Though the other side is just the same You can tell my dream is real Because I love you Can you see me now Got a good reason for loving you It's an old-fashioned sign I kinda get the feeling like, mmm, you know when I fell in love the first time Kind woman, won't you love me tonight The look in your eyes Kind woman, don't leave me lonely tonight Please say it's all right Remember once before, you're hearing the old folks say Love's an ageless, old rhyme Now-a-days, you know they're saying "Depends so much on The kind of woman that you find"Kind woman, won't you love me tonight The look in your eyes Kind woman, don't leave me lonely tonight Are you saying it's all right Sit down I think I love you Anyway I'd like to try I can't stop thinkin' of you If you go I'll know I cry Can't you see that I'm a desperate man I get high just being around You oughta know what they say about the bird in the hand And that's why I ain't leaving without you So if you want someone to love you Pretty baby I'm your guy It's not much I'm askin' of you Just to please give me a try Can't you see that I'm a desperate man I get high just being around You know what they say about the bird in my hand And that's why I ain't leaving without youIs my world not falling down I'm in pieces on the ground And my eyes aren't open And I'm standing on my knees But if crying and holding on And flying on the ground is wrong Then I'm sorry to let you down But you're from my side of town And I miss you Turn me up or turn me down Turn me off or turn me 'round I wish I could have met you in a place Where we both belong But if crying and holding on And flying on the ground is wrong Then I'm sorry to let you down But you're from my side of town And I miss you
