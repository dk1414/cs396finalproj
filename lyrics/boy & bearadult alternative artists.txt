Hey boy, now, what you making Looking up as you go I heard your voice just the other day, on the radio But like an ancient shrine that has swallowed your mind Well, you lost yourself with nothing to say I'd not the heart to ask you to stay Sweet times, all made up in my mind Where'd you go Where'd you go Where'd you go Where'd you go I know that wonder couldn't wake you From a slumber so slow Hazy Jane, well you known my name for a while now And all that wasted time following dotted lines Is enough to send a man insane I'd not the heart to ask you to stay Sweet times, all made up in my mind Where'd you go Where'd you go Where'd you go Where'd you go In all you've seen, what was it that came down on me that night A conjuring; I held on to that moment and lie just to make it alive I stood out there in the covering In the baskings of a holy night And I was lucid and conscious And hovering like a firefly My mind stretched out on the canopy It put its arms out slow And I heard the whispers of silence Floating down from the radio So come on, come on, I'm ready now I got that feeling, honey, like I'm ready to roll You see, I'm not gonna wait till the end of me'Cause I got the burning fire in the bed of my soul I saw the light from a kettle gun Sixteen days under a southern sun And there were times when I thought that I wouldn't mind it if I lost my mind out there You wouldn't believe me if I told you so The things I saw, were enough to make the man in me a man of me Mm, make a man of me...So come on, come on, I'm ready now Go get your things out, honey, let's get ready to roll Oh, I can feel a wave coming over me I've been waiting for this day too long just to let it all go As a child, I was wonder eyed At the thought that I might know A life in the ecstasy of rock n' roll, oh Woah-oh, I'm not taking it slow, oh, oh I'm an arrow in a bow, oh, oh You think that I don't know, oh, oh What it is that makes it glow, oh, oh.. Whenever I fall at your feet I'm really close tonight And I feel like I am moving inside her I'm lying in the dark And I think that I'm beginning to know her Let it go I'll be there when you call Whenever I fall at your feet You let your tears rain down on me Whenever I touch your slow turning pain You're hiding from me now There's something in the way that you're talking Words don't sound right I can hear them all moving inside her Know I'll be waiting when you call Whenever I fall at your feet You let your tears rain down on me Whenever I touch your slow turning pain The finger of blame has turned upon itself And I'm more than willing to offer myself Did you want my presence or need my help Who knows where that might lead And I fallYou were broken Caught up in those games You've never known when just living's enough'Cause we don't hurt when we're hoping So strangers we seek Now, watch it burn to the limit of love Down you go, watch your spirit Caught up in those flames Got too close to the limit of love It's not your fault what you're feeling You've bought into that beautiful lie, alright So close to the limit of love Where nothing matters What you said that night Didn't fade away In the cleanest light, I ain't got nothing to hide Through your lonesome eyes You swore that you could never be satisfied Too close to the limit of loveMy body moves in time We're begging on the feeding line We're lifting out above this head space See, my body overflows But I got my whole damn life Caught up in moments entirely of yours But I'm finding it harder to reason in order to grow And finding it hard is a feeling that all of you know Know, know See, my body keeps in line And I got my whole damn life Oh, and I want to be somebody, somebody, someone You're so desperate now Oh no, you won't let it go But you bit off your tongue to become one And nevertheless, when this pain in my chest seems to grow I'm living it harder to feel what it feels like to know You know, know, knowIt was the strangest night The kind of scene I don't fit into It didn't feel so right And she came back 'round Drifting across my sight Some apparition of make believe I felt my chest grow tight And I tumbled in And she said, "Hey baby, hold my hand out on the wire"Oh, I'm telling you, the whole thing is just a breaking of desire You inevitably hold on, because you always do You gotta walk that wire Oh, I'm talkin' in tongues, 'cause I'm not made of steel Somebody save me from myself I'm just a man, alright And I'm fumbling With all this fading light May be the moment to make my move You hold your breath so tight'Cause we're tumblingAnd I've been worried for a while now Cause you don't look the same How the devil takes his toll When you go walking through that flame And I'm not saying it's been easy But you know all too well Oh, you cannot replace the space Your spirit had once held So we run through the jungle And I can feel the rhythm of war You see, I'm fighting But I just can't fight anymore I'm in awe...So we'll give ourselves to the harlequin dream Giving over all our friends and our family And we'll say goodbye to the world that we love For I can no longer deny my blood And now you're taking on a kingdom I'm ravenous for more Oh, an appetite so beautiful But vacant to its core'Cause you're hurting I can tell by the way that you move You got your head on your chest And your chest in your mouth, you don't look so good There'll be change Cause this one's too big not to see But brother, you're scared and I'm scared When you're scared, 'cause you ain't supposed to be So I'll scream out loud, 'Won't you get out my way ''Cause I got the animal I've got the beast on a leash these days So you don't go wandering back down the black To that awful place And help Is well on its way You taught me too much to sit back And watch you this way Just to watch you this wayThere's a night owl and it laughs at me Says what you're coming for is insane But you can't possibly know me well I'm the people's panic today Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong Or maybe I'm just dumb Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong Or maybe I'm just dumb I made a plan to get on living Took a chance to hold on tight To the fantasy I'm givin' in I guess I thought it'd be alright Cause there's a night owl, and it laughs at me Says what you're coming for is insane But you can't possibly know me well I'm the people's panic today Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong Or maybe I'm just dumb Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong Or maybe I'm just dumbHey boy, now, what you making Looking up as you go I heard your voice just the other day, on the radio But like an ancient shrine that has swallowed your mind Well, you lost yourself with nothing to say I'd not the heart to ask you to stay Sweet times, all made up in my mind Where'd you go Where'd you go Where'd you go Where'd you go I know that wonder couldn't wake you From a slumber so slow Hazy Jane, well you known my name for a while now And all that wasted time following dotted lines Is enough to send a man insane I'd not the heart to ask you to stay Sweet times, all made up in my mind Where'd you go Where'd you go Where'd you go Where'd you go
