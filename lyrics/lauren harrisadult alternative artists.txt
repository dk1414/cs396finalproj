what’s comin It’s time for you to learn to lose My turn to watch you fall apart You found someone just like youThe closer you get to me I feel you pull away As crazy as you seem to me I know you're just afraid Stop making up excuses honey I've heard all kinds of lies Start taking it like a man for me, here come the big surprise Love you, get over it, I do I know that it scares you, a little bit Get over it, get over it I think you can handle this, have your cake and eat it too Sometimes a kiss is just a kiss I'm not asking much of you And I can't tell you why or how I know you're taking me

you go Hey girl, now does it feel all right Think I'm gettin' through Don't you think the band's real tight Wait til we start to move May sound funny but you gave it to me I didn't even like it May

itRead it in the paper Nothing comes free I don't need nobody Praying for me Only ever tell you What they want you to know Why don't you do it Why don't you go Don't you struggle Don't you lie Sell your secrets It will be alright Can't let this chance Pass me by I can see it For the first time I'm gonna steal your fire When all these changes come See them falling one by one I'm gonna steal your fire When all these changes come See them falling one by one Meet me in the middle Listen to the sound Everything you say Comes back round Why did you do it Why did you lie You can't escape The feeling inside Can't let this chance Pass me by Tell myself it's Gonna be alright I can feel it I can hear it I can see it For the first time I'm gonna steal your fire When all these changes come See them falling one by one I'm gonna steal your fire When all these changes come See them falling one by one Tell me that your satisfied Tell me was it suicide You've been living in another world Change is coming all across this land Are you strong enough Are you brave enough Was it ever enough Have you had enough You gotta lie down in the bed you made You got laugh at all the madness Whatever's gone wrong i can make it right Free myself of all the sadness I'm sick of this world and it's greed for gold I'm sick and tired of being bought and sold Life's a gamble, nothing's sure I can see it for the
