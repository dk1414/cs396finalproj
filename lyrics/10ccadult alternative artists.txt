I'm not in love, so don't forget it It's just a silly phase I'm going through And just because I call you up Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made I'm not in love, no, no I like to see you, but then again That doesn't mean you mean that much to me So if I call you, don't make a fuss Don't tell your friends about the two of us I'm not in love, no, no Be quiet, big boys don't cry Big boys don't cry Big boys don't cry Big boys don't cry Big boys don't cry Big boys don't cry.. I was walkin' down the street Concentrating on truckin' right I heard a dark voice beside of me And I looked round in a state of fright I saw four faces, one mad A brother from the gutter They looked me up and down a bit And turned to each other I say I don't like cricket, oh no I love it I don't like cricket, no no I love it Don't you walk through my words You got to show some respect Don't you walk through my words'Cause you ain't heard me out yet Well he looked down at my silver chain He said I'll give you one dollar I said you've got to be joking man It was a present from me mother He said I like it I want it I'll take it off your hands And you'll be sorry you crossed me You'd better understand that you're alone A long way from homeToo many broken hearts have fallen in the river Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea You lay your bets and then you pay the price The things we do for love The things we do for love Communication is the problem to the answer You've got her number And your hand is on the phone The weather's turned and all the lines are down The things we do for love The things we do for love Like walking in the rain and the snow When there's nowhere to go And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying And you're looking for the answer in her eyes You think you're gonna break up Then she says she wants to make up Ooh you made me love you Ooh you've got a way Ooh you had me crawling up the wallI went to a party At the local county jail All the cons were dancing And the band began to wail But the guys were indiscreet They were brawling in the street At the local dance At the local county jail Well the band were playing And the booze began to flow But the sound came over On the police car radio Down at Precinct 49 Having a tear-gas of a time Sergeant Baker got a call From the governor of the county jail Load up, load up, load up With rubber bullets Load up, load up, load up With rubber bullets I love to hear those convicts squeal It's a shame these slugs ain't real But we can't have dancin'At the local county jailOh, no you'll never get me up in one of these again'Cause what goes up Must comeâ€”Just like a rollin' stone I'm outside lookin' in But if your chance came would you take it Where on earth do I begin I'm Mandy, fly me I've often heard her jingle It's never struck a chord With a smile as bright as sunshine She called me through the poster And welcomed me aboard She led me she fed me She read me like a book But I'm hiding in the small print Won't you take another look And take me away Try me, Mandy, fly me awayI'm dancing on the White House lawn Sipping tea by the Taj Mahal at dawn Hanging 'round the gardens of Babylon Minnie Mouse has got it all sewn up She gets more fan mail than the Pope She takes the Mickey out of all my phobias Like signing cheques to ward off double pneumonia Life is a minestrone Served up with parmesan cheese Death is a cold lasagne Suspended in deep freeze I'm leaning on the Tower of Pisa Had an eyeful of the tower in France I'm hanging 'round the gardens of Madison The seat of learning and the flush of success Relieves a constipated mind I'm like a gourmet in a skid row diner A fitting menu for a dilettante Life is a minestrone Served up with parmesan cheese Death is a cold lasagne Suspended in deep freezeMme  Bezier :Bonjour, monsieur Paris really welcomes you It's the best room in the house It's forty francs a night, all right Touriste :It's crazy, it isn't worth a centime I'll take it!Mme  Bezier :Merci, Monsieur Offstage Chorus :Rouged lips in the gaslight A great view of the hall That's the way the croissant crumbles after all Narrator :Paris is only one step away Les girls are out on bail Tres bien, there's love for sale Coquette :Oh my cheri, wish you were mine And I'll show you a wonderful time For the price of a cheap champagne I'll show it you once againIt's one thing to know it but another to admit We're the worst band in the world But we don't give up If Garbo played guitar With Valentino on the drums Then we'd be nothing more than a bunch of Dharma bums So tune up Tune up Well we've never done a days work in our life And our records sell in zillions It irrigates my heart with greed To know that you adore me Up yours, up mine But up everybody's  That takes time!But we're working on it Working on it We never seen the van -
