Take me now, baby, here as I am Pull me close, try and understand Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe Love is a banquet on which we feed Come on now try and understand The way I feel when I'm in your hands Take my hand come undercover They can't hurt you now Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now Because the night belongs to lovers Because the night belongs to lust Because the night belongs to lovers Because the night belongs to us Have I doubt when I'm alone Love is a ring, the telephone Love is an angel disguised as lust Here in our bed until the morning comes Come on now try and understand The way I feel under your command Take my hand as the sun descends They can't touch you now Can't touch you now, can't touch you nowJesus died for somebody's sins but not mine Melting in a pot of thieves, wild card up my sleeve Thick, heart of stone, my sins, my own They belong to me Me People said beware, but I don't care Their words are just rules and regulations to me Me I walk in a room, you know I look so proud I move in this here atmosphere where anything's allowed Then I go to this here party and I just get bored Until I look out the window, see a sweet young thing Humping on a parking meter, leaning on the parking meter Oh, she looks so good Oh, she looks so fine And I've got this crazy feeling that I'm going to, ah-ah, make her mine Oh, I'll put my spell on her, here she comes Walking down the street, here she comes Coming through my door, here she comes Crawling up my stair, here she comes Waltzing through the hall in a pretty red dress And oh, she looks so good Oh, she looks so fine And I've got this crazy feeling that I'm going to, ah-ah, make her mineThe boy was in the hallway drinking a glass of tea From the other end of the hallway a rhythm was generating Another boy was sliding up the hallway He merged perfectly with the hallway He merged perfectly, the mirror in the hallway The boy looked at Johnny, Johnny wanted to run But the movie kept moving as planned The boy took Johnny , he pushed him against the locker He drove it in, he drove it home, he drove it deep in Johnny The boy disappeared, Johnny fell on his knees Started crashing his head against the locker Started crashing his head against the locker Started laughing hysterically When suddenly Johnny gets the feeling he's being surrounded by Horses, horses, horses, horses Coming in in all directions White shining silver studs with their nose in flames He saw horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horsesHis father died and left him a little farm in New England All the long black funeral cars left the scene And the boy was just standing there alone Looking at the shiny red tractor Him and his daddy used to sit inside And circle the blue fields and grease the night It was as if someone had spread butter On all the fine points of the stars'Cause when he looked up they started to slip Then he put his head in the crux of his arms And he started to drift, drift to the belly of a ship Let the ship slide open, and he went inside of it And saw his daddy behind the control board Streaming beads of light He saw his daddy behind the control board And he was very different tonight'Cause he was not human He was not human The little boy's face lit up with such naked joy That the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns White lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearly And he looked around and there was no black ship in sight No black funeral cars, nothing except for him the raven And fell on his knees and looked up and cried out"No, daddy, don't leave me here alone Take me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship Let the ship slide open and I'll go inside of it Where you are not human You are not human"She is benediction She is addicted to thee She is the root connection She is connecting with he Here I go and I don't know why I fell so ceaselessly Could it be he's taking over me I'm dancing barefoot Heading for a spin Some strange music draws me in Makes me come on like some heroine She is sublimation She is the essence of thee She is concentrating on He, who is chosen by she Here I go and I don't know why I spin so ceaselessly Could it be he's taking over me Baby was a black sheep baby was a whore Baby got big and baby get bigger Baby get something baby get more Baby baby baby was a rock n roll nigg​er Oh look around you all around you Riding on a copper wave Do you like the world around you Are you ready to behave Outside of society they're waitin for me Outside of society that's

Outside of society that's where I want to be Outside of society they're waitin for me Those who have suffered understand suffering And thereby extend their hand The storm that brings harm Also makes fertile blessed is the grass And herb and the true thorn and lightLate afternoon, dreaming hotel We just had the quarrel that sent you away I was looking for you Are you gone, gone Called you on the phone, another dimension Well you never returned, oh, you know what I mean I went looking for you Are you gone, gone Down by the ocean it was so dismal Women all standing with shock on their faces Sad description, oh, I was looking for you Everyone was singing, girl is washed up On Redondo Beach and everyone is so sad I was looking for you Are you gone, gone Pretty little girl everyone cried She was the victim of sweet suicide I went looking for you Are you gone, gone Every night before I go to sleep Find a ticket, win a lottery Scoop the pearls up from the sea Cash them in and buy you all the things you need Every night before I rest my head See those dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed I know they're stolen, but I don't feel bad I take that money, buy you things you never had Oh, baby, it would mean so much to me Oh, baby, to buy you all the things you need for free I'll buy you a jet plane, babe Get you on a higher plane to a jet stream And take you through the stratosphere And check out the planets there and then take you down Deep where it's hot, hot in Arabia, baby Then cool, cold fields of snow And we'll roll, dream, roll, dream, roll, roll, dream, dream When we dream it When we dream it When we dream it We'll dream it, dream it for free, free money Free money, free money Free money, free money Free money, free moneyPissing in a river watching it rise Tattoo fingers shy away from me Voices voices mesmerize Voices voices beckoning sea Come, come, come, come back Come back, come back, come back, come back Spoke of a wheel, tip of a spoon Mouth of a cave, I'm slave I'm free When are you coming hope you come soon Fingers fingers encircling thee Come, come, come, come come Come, come, come, come, come, come, come for me My bowels are empty excreting your soul What more can I give you baby I don't know What more can I give you to make this thing grow Don't turn your back now I'm talking to youThe wall is high, the black barn The babe in my arms in her swaddling clothes And I know soon that the sky will split And the planets will shift Balls of jade will drop And existence will stop Little sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind Little sister, the fates are calling on you Ah, here I stand again in this old 'lectric whirlwind The sea rushes up my knees like flame And I feel like just some misplaced Joan Of Arc And the cause is you lookin' up at me Oh baby, I remember when you were born It was dawn and the storm settled in my belly And I rolled in the grass and I spit out the gas And I lit a match and the void went flash And the sky split And the planets hit Balls of jade dropped And existence stopped, stopped, stop, stop
