Her beautiful arse Cantilevering over a table of hors d'oeuvres She took a sip of her drink and said"Hey, this music really gets on my nerves."I said, "What music "She said, "The music in my head Sometimes it makes me wish I were dead It's like a requiem It's like a rodeo Can't you hear it "I said, "No."She said she said she said She's sad, she said She said she said she said She's sad She said she said she said She's sad she said she's sad She said she said she said She said, "Like where is here And, tell me, how will I know when I get there I wear my little black dress, I'm just waiting around Will I think to comb my hair "I said, "Will it matter "She says, "Matter everywhere No one here, they never play fair I hope heaven is a place where sloe gin fizz comes in Those little glasses, you know the ones That are blue on the bottom and thin on the top "She lives, no fear, doubtless in everything she knows Through time, unchecked the sureness of her flows She leaves herself inside you when she goes She lives in a time of her own Her love whips hard like wind and stars in eager pain She wins your throughts and drives your inner planes She clears and shares a love that never drains She lives in a time of her own She lives in a time of her own She lives in a time of her own You have always heard her speaking She's been always in your ear Her voice sounds a tone within you Listen to the words you hear Her time has no past or future She lives everything she sees Her time doesn't spin outside her It's in every breath she breathes She lives in a time of her own She lives in a time of her own Her eyes breathe light, reflect the aura of her hair She sends, attends, behind an alpha stare She seeks the stars and spirals up the stair She lives in a time of her ownHearts cannot be broken, they're small squishy things They don't break like glass but they bruise easily This one you bruise Words will not be spoken never knowing what they mean Sticks and stones hurt my bones Your promises have broken me Each one you break And I want to be good but good is being simple Simple is forgetting I simply can't forget I want to be good but good is being simple SImple is forgetting And I simply can't forget Eyes are always open even when they sleep Mine are mostly closed while yours are wandering You look where you please And I want to be good but good is being simple Simple is forgetting I simply can't forget I want to be good but good is being simple SImple is forgetting And I simply can't forgetHe dreams of being a matador Waving the cape Killing the killing machine A hero of the ring he drives his car His spirits soar his spirits soar He dreams of being a matador Waving the cape Killing the killing machine A hero of the ring he drives his car His spirits soar his spirits soar He hates his job He loves his girl He dreams his dream Futures unfurl The sun collides with night and hey He talks to his dog Watches the big game on Saturday And stepping into a local store He sees his girl from elementary school She'd show her panties to the boys He smiles he's got the change he's got the change She's slipping into the lottery line He's waging war on planet Mercury Her skirt is climbing, riding high He smiles 'cause nothing changes, nothing changesThis is our story It's a short one but it's a hard harsh read Between the lines a little aching need We're a strange arrangement No strings And the music we make is serpentine And bittersweet In my youth, you know I loved you like gangbusters and now I watch you fall Twisting turning growing small You're a roomful of sorrow A spoonful of joy Another infidelity, another pang Another golden glitter boy Chorus I want you, I know it's crazy but I Really wanna leave you too I want you Boy oh boy you bring me joy And then you mke me blue I love to love you I'm a fool You're callous and you're cold And oh so cruel I'm starting to forget things Faces, names Games played, plans laid Surely there were promises made Good love is easy to find but It's hard to keep And though I hate it when you wake I still love to watch you sleep Chorus Remember the early days When nickes were dimes and a dollar Took us everywhere I don't think I ever combed my hair Is this our story Is this where the loving starts In the stillness The staring, the hardening of hearts We're a strange arrangement No strings This is not my place These are not mythings, it's not my way The pain love brings Chorus----------------------------------------------Margot known as Missy Where did she where did she How could she to that Terrible city that city Margot known as Missy To cooking school to cooking school She's a private chef on Eleventh Avenue Is she cool Chorus Margot known as Missy Margot known as Missy Margot known as Missy Where did she How could she Margot known as Missy I'd never been in love with a girl With a woman on her mind I'm not her kind I guess I'm blind Margot known as Missy Area code 11215 The letters that I write you Might be all that keeps me alive Chorus Funky break  Hey, baby Bake me a cake To culinary school to culinary school Margot known as Missy Where did she where did she Just like Hannah's sister And her friend I'm so sure Hey Margot known as Missy Is your heart girl is it still pure Chorus---------------------------------------------Arriving full of questions, It's been some years You come here pointing fingers and doubts Like you think I'm a stranger to fear of fear Like you think I know love's ins and outs What we lose, we become What we hide, we scorn and love, we scorn, and love We all get too close and we go to far Those who say they never, they lie Life's a hall of mirrors we're trapped inside;From every graven image we fly We run and fly What we lose , we become It's like I keep you from myself Like I keep you from everyone else Everyone needs their mystery Something hidden, something free You're pure light pure delight pure delight You're pure light pure delight pure delight You're pure light pure delight pure delight You're so pure Now I been out to Hollywood Them empty people they're no good Their pretty faces hold a silver scream But pretty don't mean much to me So sweet Pretty on the inside Some fright You're ugly on the outside I guess we won't be holding hands Like hallmark lovers on the sands Who needs the beaches anyway Stuff my friends and all they'd sayNative son What have you done Where have you been Who do you know Where have you been Who do you know Nothing No one Nowhere Mainly devil-may-care Nothing No one Nowhere I'm still picking things From the air Dizzy boy Is there still joy In being free And in between In being free And in between Nothing No one Nowhere Mainly devil-may-care Nothing No one Nowhere I'm still picking things From the air Dizzy boyPain makes you beautiful I give you what you want, the pain and the pleasure I'm no good for you But then you're no good for yourself I bring you pain Pain makes you beautiful I'm no good for you You're no good for yourself Strange and it's wonderful How you tell me what you need, the joy and the treasure Of pain's guilty pleasure Love's pressure painfully No sorrow tied Tied to my hurting you We delight in every torture I put you through How did we find this place This state where we satiate, where pain makes you beautiful Where you're no good for yourself No sorrow tied Tied to my hurting you To the compromising position, to all the painful things I do Pain makes you beautiful I give you what you want, the pain and the pleasure I'm no good for you, but then you're no good for youself
