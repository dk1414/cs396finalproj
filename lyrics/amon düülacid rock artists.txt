Akabara now Kalanemi then Seraphim choirs howl Minotaurus ran They broke my magic stick Over his daughter's head Oh, I'm getting sick Oh, I feel so bad The raper he is raping The victim is crying still The priest he is escaping He's creeping 'round the mill Akabara now Kalanemi then Seraphim choirs howl Minotaurus ranPáter i̱mó̱n toís ouranoís, Elthéto̱ i̱ Vasileía Sou O̱s en ouranó̱ kaí epí

Archangel's Thunderbird Go to Edgar Allen In the tower of sleep He'll tell you a story Which makes you to creep The echo of your cries Is falling so deep Rent a destroyer And sail to Cape Cod There lives a lion They call him God There is no elevator to Eden But a hole in the sky In shock corridors Standing people With their eyes in their hands But they don't understand Don't get Why their confessional folding chairs Go into the narcotic flight of stairs Baiting soldiers are sleeping In the melting House of Wax Why is the audience not taking The insurrection axe Thousands of windows burst open And the alarm bells are brokenIhr ließet die Kindlein zu mir kommen In weißen Kleidern und Blumen im Haar Hab' ich ihnen die Unschuld genommen Kann euch nicht sagen, wie schön es war Dienet dem Schönen, dem Guten, dem Wahren Peitschet ihn aus, er bebt schon danach Lasst ihn die süße Qual erfahren Er sehnt sich so nach Schande und Schmach – ja!Wir tanzten zusammen Ringelreih'n Und sangen ein wunderschönes Lied Die kleinste fing an, nach der Mutter zu schrei'n Ich durchbohrte sie sanft mit meinem Glied Kommet zuhauf und seht ihn euch an Das Haupt kahlgeschoren und lächelt noch Frisch ans Werk, 's ist gleich getan Hängt ihn auf, den geilen Moloch – ja Sometimes I'm missing a word from my friends Why can't we share the problems hand in hand And when I ask my mirror what is the truth All the funny things you do!Look into my eyes Do you really mean it 'Cause this is no question You have to face the facts in time and Don't forget you're high Wouldn't you rather check what's your confession Green bubbles came out of the crystal thing A sudden cry of an old rain-coated guy And softly grey gnomes were whispering to my ear:All the funny things you do!Look into my eyes Do you really mean it 'Cause this is no question You have to face the facts in time and Don't forget you're high Wouldn't you rather check what's your confession Just an advice: Don't ask your face tonight Don't tell the words you like so much Don't tell, just act in spite Don't try to prove your own brain's might Don't lose the sun, 'cause you need funShe suddenly stood alone Shut down by silver and gold The priest came and kissed her hands My daughter  Soon you'll be released She nodded, yes, she was the one Who ate neighbour's babies They even point at the chimney Down there in the gloomy room Widows versed in law came soon My daughter  We are so polite Cutting the face from her smile Her lungs run into fire Her  flying much higher And then there is the mechanical heart of the god Is always repeating the same She stuttered, "Yes, she was the one"Who made the  dream Who come from across the sea They cut the tree of her life With their hypnotic knifeListen to me there's a thing I can't say out loud I thought it was you and I was so fucking proud Many a friend walks past your hand, I think that's alright And I don't care anymore about holding you tight Another girl is going through my mind only just that I've been blind Since I know her, I know what's beauty To keep her happy seems my duty Don't you pretend you would understand it's easy for me My head  and I got to Go, I got to be free I know that I would leave you brokenhearted Even you realise that we still stand right where we started Another girl is going through my mind only just I've been blind Since I know her, I know what's beauty To keep her happy seems my duty I'm scared I could do something wrong So I just write another songDown on the football place I saw my sister burning They tied her on a railroad track And made her blue eyes burning Her dog was sitting by her feet The whole night he was howling In dirty pants the judge came down Slavering his golden gown Yes, she was the one Who turned the rain into black The television vulture...They brought my sister to trial Cutting her face from her smile On the holy waterfront The people stand there waiting To see her blonde hair lighted To see her blood drip on the floorOn a telegraph pole An assassin is training his soul Locked up in a fancy room Not very far from doom Intoxicated kids Are ready to quit His desires they scatter His nerves they shatter No window to see No door to flee The heart-attack machine Is out of gear The mighty nightmare-employer Professor of paranoia Is stealing near Seven miles from here Smoke coming out of their eyes Insanity-tigers are licking his hands A short romance A vaporised dance
