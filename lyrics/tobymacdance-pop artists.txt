Woke up 'cause the light poured in Day two, let the flood begin Day one left me in my bed I can barely remember it Heart shattered in a thousand ways They tell me pain gonna come in waves They tell me I'm gonna be okay I'm still waitin' for the first to break Why would You give and then take him away Suddenly end, could You not let it fade What I would give for a couple of days A couple of days Is it just across the Jordan Or a city in the stars Are you singin' with the angels Are you happy where you are Well, until this show is over And you run into my arms God has you in Heaven But I have you in my heart I have you in my heartUh, last night put the heavy on me Woke up and I'm feeling lonely This world gotta a way of showing me Some days it'll lift you up Some days it'll call your bluff Man, most of my days I ain't got enough And all I know Is You're my only hope When I'm up, when I'm down When the wolves come around When my feet hit the ground I just need, I just need You On my darkest days When I'm losing faith No, it ain't gon' change I just need, I just need You Lord, I need You Yeah, I just need You Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me Thy rod and thy staffFunktify C'mon'Bout to do it like this, 'bout to do it like this, y'all1-21-2-3-4 1-2 1-2-3-4 When I sit back and imagine Life without You, I

promised land Yeah, I'm wondеrin'Still I'm wonderin'Where's my promised land No, no You home Just beepin' in right now I gotta go Hey Had you on my mind I had a little time I know we kinda overdue Turnin' back the pages To our younger days, yeah I can still imagine you Boomin' like the thunder Chasin' life with wonder With fire that could light a room Bottom kinda fell out Waited for the rebound But you never made a move When life cuts so deep Try and rememberMay be midnight or mid-day Never early, never late He gon' stand by what He claimed Lived enough life to say…I heard your heart, I see your pain Out in the dark, out in the rain Feels so alone, feels so afraid I heard you pray in Jesus' name It may be midnight or mid-day He's never early, never late He gon' stand by what He claimed I lived enough life to say… Help is on the way Roundin' the corner Help is on the way Comin' for ya Help is on the way Yea-ee-ayy I lived enough life to say Help is on the way
