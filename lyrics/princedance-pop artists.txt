Now this is a story all about how My life got flipped turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air In West Philadelphia born and raised On the playground is where I spent most of my days Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket I put my Walkman on and said "I might as well kick it"First class, yo, this is bad Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like Hmm, this might be all right But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat I don't think so, I'll see when I get there I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-AirI hate it when dudes try to chase me But I love it when you try to save me‘Cause I'm just a lady I love it when we play 1950 It's so cold that your stare's 'bout to kill me I'm surprised when you kiss me So tell me why my Gods look like you And tell me why it's wrong So I'll wait for you, I'll pray I will keep on waiting for your love For you, I'll wait I will keep on waiting for your Did you mean it when you said I was pretty That you didn't wanna live in a city Where the people are shitty I like it when we play 1950 So bold, make them know that you're with me Stone cold, will you miss me I never meant to cause you any sorrow I never meant to cause you any pain I only wanted one time to see you laughing I only wanted to see you laughing In the purple rain Purple rain, purple rain Purple rain, purple rain Purple rain, purple rain I only want to see you bathing In the purple rain I never wanted to be your weekend lover I only wanted to be some kind of friend, hey Baby, I could never steal you from another It's such a shame our friendship had to end Purple rain, purple rain Purple rain, purple rain Purple rain, purple rain I only want to see you underneath the purple rainYeah, I swear this gon' fuck the summer up Niggas hatin' on me 'cause

the clip I swear I'm too official, I could never stress a bitch I done lost a couple soldiers, every day I reminisce And I could've took his bitch, but her pussy smelled like fish Me and all my niggas

through this thing called "life"Electric word, life It means forever and that's a mighty long time But I'm here to tell you there's something else The afterworld A world of never ending happiness You
