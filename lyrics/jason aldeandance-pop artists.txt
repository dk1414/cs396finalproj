Like a rainy Sunday mornin'Makes me wanna stay in bed twisted up all day long You're my inspiration, girl You take me places, put the words right into these songs Stealin' kisses under cover, babe See forever when I see your face And I swear God made you for me You make it easy lovin' up on you Make it easy with every little thing you do You're my sunshine in the darkest days My better half, my savin' grace You make me who I wanna be You make it easy You took all my rough around the edges Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel Yeah, I'm down for life, you got me wrapped around your finger And I like it just in case you can't tell You make it easy lovin' up on you Make it easy with every little thing you do You're my sunshine in the darkest days My better half, my savin' grace You make me who I wanna be You make it easyShe had a shiny little Beamer with the ragtop down Sittin' in the drive but she wouldn't get out The dogs were all barkin' and a-waggin' around And I just laughed and said "Y'all get in"She had on a new dress and she'd curled her hair She was lookin' too good not to go somewhere Said what you want to do, baby, I don't care We can go to the show, or we can stay right here And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor We can go slow or make it go faster Down through the woods and out to the pasture Long as I'm with you it really don't matter Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to Girl, you know you got me to hold on to We can go to town but baby, if you'd rather I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor Said we can fire it up and I can show you around Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down When the fireflies are dancin' and the moon comes out We can turn on the lights and head back to the houseYeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones Smoke rollin' out the window An ice cold beer sittin' in the console Memory lane up in the headlights It's got me reminiscin' on them good times I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go Load the truck up, hit the dirt road Jump the barbwire, spread the word Light the bonfire, then call the girls The king in the can and the Marlboro man Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too Better watch out for the boys in blue And all this small town he said, she said Ain't it funny how rumors spread Like I know something y'all don't know Man that talk is getting old Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth Before I have to knock that loud mouth out I'm tired of talkin', man, y'all ain't listening Them old dirt roads is what y'all missingLove how you close your eyes when I pull you in closer Tonight's movin' fast but we ain't takin' it slower You hit me harder than a drink does You're gonna take me all the way up Something about you baby, got me goin' crazy I don't know what to do I've never met a girl like you That's ever done it quite like you do Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks Your lips are just the cherry on top I've never been high like this Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold An' I don't want to let you go I've never met a girl like you Love how you say my name and make it sound so sexy Love how you do that thing, yeah you know what gets me I'm talkin' slow motion all night long Baby, love you with the lights on I've never met a girl like you That's ever done it quite like you do Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks Your lips are just the cherry on top I've never been high like this Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold An' I don't want to let you go I've never met a girl like youAll the folks down in Lynchburg, Tennessee Been working hard for good ol' boys like me I don't wanna be the one to tell 'em That stuff that they've been selling Ain't working like it should But I damn sure wish it would Whiskey's supposed to drown the memory I've gone from one to one too many And the thing that really gets me Is how your memory drowns the whiskey Maybe it's the bar or the stool I'm on Maybe it's the band and the sad old song That keeps me buying rounds That keeps me turning down Any girl that wants to dance And you ain't giving them a chance Whiskey's supposed to drown the memory I've gone from one to one too many And the thing that really gets me Is how your memory drowns the whiskeyYou slip your finger through the tear in my t-shirt You stirrin' up dirty in the back of my mind You keep on flirtin', 'cause you know that it's workin'You stuck in my head girl writing the lines Couldn't sing this song without you if I tried Let's light it up like it's our last night We're just hanging around Burnin' it down Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby Laying right here naked in my bed I'm just doing my thing You love it when I sing Say it makes you feel like an angel We about to get a little tangled up right about now So girl let's keep burnin' it down Burnin' it down, burnin' it down Girl when you want it You know that I'm on it You know that I love lovin' up on you Let's hit the switch and let our shadows dance And light it up like it's our last chanceWiped the footprints off my dash Tore up those sun-faded photographs Threw 'em in the wind, ya'll can have it back I'm outta here I stuck my middle finger up in the sky Flipped off that "ya'll come back" sign Looked in the mirror one last time And watched it disappear It ain't nothin' but a rearview town Broken hearts and rusted plows Roots ripped right up out of the ground Never thought I'd ever leave it It ain't nothin' what it used to be Population minus me On the other side of that dust cloud Ain't nothin' but a rearview town I could tough it out, but what's the use A place that small, it's hard to do Too much of her to run into And so much road to somewhere newI guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide Girl, you know those rumors get to flyin' in a town this size No, I didn't feel a thing when you threw that ring and slammed the door If you wanna know the truth you gotta go straight to the source Ask any ol' barstool in this town Ask my new found party crowd Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now A little more high in my smoke now Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone And I take the long way home But I ain't sittin' 'round Tryin' to drown The thought of you Ask any ol' barstool I can finally stretch out in our king size bed if I make it that far But fillin' in all these blanks you left isn't all that hard No, I ain't wonderin' where you been or who you been with I guess you didn't hurt me half as bad as you think you did Ask any ol' barstool in this town Ask my new found party crowd Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now A little more high in my smoke now Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone And I take the long way home But I ain't sittin' 'round Tryin' to drown The thought of you Ask any ol' barstoolYou boys ever met a real country girl Talkin', true blue, out in the woods, down-home, country girl She's a hot little number in her pickup truck Daddy's sweet money done jacked it up She's a party all-nighter from South Carolina A bad mamajama from down in Alabama She's a ragin' cajun, a lunatic from Brunswick Juicy Georgia Peach with a thick southern drawl Sexy swing and walk, brother, she's all Country From her cowboy boots to her down home roots She's country From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays That's the way she was born and raised She ainâ€™t afraid to stay Country Brother, she's country A hell raisin' sugar when the sun goes down Mama taught her how to rip up the town Honey drippin' honey from the holler in Kentucky Get you flippin', kinda trippy like a Mississippi hippie She's a Kansas princess Crazy mother trucker, undercover lover Thick southern drawl, sexy swing and walk Brother, she's allI wouldn't mind bein' alone I wouldn't keep checkin' my phone Wouldn't take the long way home Just to drive myself crazy I wouldn't be losin' sleep Rememberin' everything Everything you said to me Like I'm doin' lately You, you wouldn't be all All that I want Baby, I could let go If I didn't love you I'd be good by now I'd be better than barely gettin' by somehow Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you Wonder about who's with you Turn the want you off whenever I want to If I didn't love you If I didn't love you I wouldn't still cry sometimes Wouldn't have to fake a smile Play it off and tell a lie When somebody asked how I've been I'd try to find someone new It should be somethin' I can do Baby, if it weren't for you I wouldn't be in the state that I'm in
