Nights in white satin, never reaching the end Letters I've written, never meaning to send Beauty I'd always missed, with these eyes before Just what the truth is, I can't say anymore'Cause I love you Yes, I love you Oh, I love you Gazing at people, some hand in hand Just what I'm going through, they can't understand Some try to tell me thoughts they cannot defend Just what you want to be, you will be in the end And I love you Yes, I love you Ah, how I love you Ah, how I love you Nights in white satin, never reaching the end Letters I've written, never meaning to send Beauty I've always missed, with these eyes before Just what the truth is, I can't say anymoreWhy do we never get an answer When we're knocking at the door With a thousand million questions About hate and death and war'Cause when we stop and look around us There is nothing that we need In a world of persecution That is burning in its greed Ahhhh ahh ah Why do we never get an answer When we're knocking at the door Because the truth is hard to swallow That's what the wall of love is for It's not the way that you say it When you do those things to me It's more the way that you mean it When you tell me what will be And when you stop and think about it You won't believe it's true That all the love you've been giving Has all been meant for youI'm a melancholy man, that's what I am All the world surrounds me and my feet are on the ground I'm a very lonely man, doing what I can All the world astounds me and I think I understand That we're going to keep growing, wait and see When all the stars are falling down Into the sea and on the ground And angry voices carry on the wind A beam of light will fill your head And you'll remember what's been said By all the good men this world's ever known Another man is what you'll see Who looks like you and looks like me And yet somehow he will not feel the same His life caught up in misery He doesn't think like you and me'Cause he can't see what you and I can see When all the stars are falling down Into the sea and on the ground And angry voices carry on the wind A beam of light will fill your head And you'll remember what's been said By all the good men this world's ever known Another man is what you'll see Who looks like you and looks like me And yet somehow he will not feel the same His life caught up in misery He doesn't think like you and me 'Cause he can't see what you and I can see]]Cold hearted orb that rules the night Removes the colours from our sight Red is grey and yellow -
