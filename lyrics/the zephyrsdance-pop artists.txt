Clear me a space To gaze at the stars They dreamed about telescopes Alone in the park I thought of the empty cars Surrounded by ugly homes So hand me a pen To write the card To say goodbye Clear me a space To gaze at the stars They dreamed about telescopesThe buildings aren't going anywhere But don't they look lonely from here Street lit twin domes Long time no see And God you look better now Just my luckThe last tear that you cried Was your last wave goodbye The first arc of the sun Appeared in the sky To light up the room And all who stand round Holding your hand She gave you a flower To plant before dawn And gave us this house With a wild green lawn The longer it's been The deeper it goes No one can live On this much sleep If I let you in, you'll ruin my day If I let you out, you'll look back and see That I'm tired beyond belief And I'm scared to fall asleep I thought that I lay awake in my room Until I woke it slowly seeped in She beats on my chest, I've been here before I thought that I heard feet in the hallI'll only be gone for a while The visit was long overdue I'll count back from every mile A while is a long way from you You really should get some rest now I'll see you on my return Once you have got your strength back A while won't be a moment at allI was oh so nearly Tempted into your bed It'd all gone so far The idea had run through your head But I came back home anyway The next day The dew was still fresh on my shoe That lay by the door As I lay down flat in the hall And whisper to you That I'm not going to lie anymore As we talked I grew old This is not where I thought we would be To pay back in kind what I owe Will cost all I own So please don't cry anymore For the love that will guide you back home I was oh so nearly Tempted into your bedClear me a space To gaze at the stars They dreamed about telescopes Alone in the park I thought of the empty cars Surrounded by ugly homes So hand me a pen To write the card To say goodbye Clear me a space To gaze at the stars They dreamed about telescopesThe buildings aren't going anywhere But don't they look lonely from here Street lit twin domes Long time no see And God you look better now Just my luckThe last tear that you cried Was your last wave goodbye The first arc of the sun Appeared in the sky To light up the room And all who stand round Holding your hand She gave you a flower To plant before dawn And gave us this house With a wild green lawn The longer it's been The deeper it goes No one can live On this much sleep If I let you in, you'll ruin my day If I let you out, you'll look back and see That I'm tired beyond belief And I'm scared to fall asleep I thought that I lay awake in my room Until I woke it slowly seeped in She beats on my chest, I've been here before I thought that I heard feet in the hallI'll only be gone for a while The visit was long overdue I'll count back from every mile A while is a long way from you You really should get some rest now I'll see you on my return Once you have got your strength back A while won't be a moment at allI was oh so nearly Tempted into your bed It'd all gone so far The idea had run through your head But I came back home anyway The next day The dew was still fresh on my shoe That lay by the door As I lay down flat in the hall And whisper to you That I'm not going to lie anymore As we talked I grew old This is not where I thought we would be To pay back in kind what I owe Will cost all I own So please don't cry anymore For the love that will guide you back home I was oh so nearly Tempted into your bed
