apart And take my brain, or what remains And throw it all away'Cause I've grown tired of this body A cumbersome and heavy body Take my lungs, take them and run Take my tongue, go have some fun And take the ears, take them and disappear And take my joints, take them for points Take my teeth, tear through my cheeks And take the nose, go and dispose Oh, would you go dispose, just go dispose 'Cause I've grown tired of this body A cumbersome and heavy body I've grown tired of this body Fall apart without me, body OohWhatever happened to the young, young lovers One got shot and the other got lost in Drugs and punks and blood on the street Blo-blood on her knees, bloody history Whatever happened to the hayloft Burnt to the ground, and what about Pop He took his ass back to the crack shack With his long johns on, singing that old song My baby's got a gun My baby's got a gun My baby's got a gun I better run My baby's got a gun It goes Boom boom crack Ga-ga-ga-ga boom boom An eye for an eye, a leg for a leg A shot in the heart doesn't make it un-break She really didn't wanna make it messy She really, really didn't but the girl gone crayThey got my blood up in their veins I get a cut, they feel my pain They got my heart, they got my soul They know the stuff nobody knows When we’re out for dinner we’re cussing like sailors The people are staring and talking in whispers“Hey what’s with the strange breed ”They is my family, they is my family They might be crazy, but they is my family You can’t get through them unless you get through me You fuck with them you fuck with me And when you’re standing on the ledge I’ll pull ya down, put you to bed And if you’re bleeding from the heart I'll come around, and clean it up When we’re at the party we’re dancing on tables And people are staring like they got a peephole“Hey look at the strange breed”They is my family, they is my family They might be crazy, but they is my family You can’t get to them unless you get through me You fuck with them you fuck with meUp on my side, where it is felt I pack a little pistol on my pistol belt I think it might be fear Of the world and the way it makes you feel afraid Under the skin, against the skull They put a little chip so that they know it all I think I might be scared Of the world and the way it makes you feel afraid And how it gets in the way And now I want brimstone in my garden I want roses set on fire And I, well I want what’s best for me And I, I think I know just what that means Just what that means Today I coo, today I caw I have a pistol party and I kill ‘em all I think I might be scared Of the man and the men with their hands inside And the women, oh, the women all they do is cry And I, well I lose my mind
