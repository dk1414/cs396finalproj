Freddy, my love I miss you more than words can say Freddy, my love Please keep in touch while you're away Hearing from you can make the day so much better Getting a souvenir or maybe a letter I really flipped over the gray cashmere sweater Freddy, my love, Freddy, my love, Freddy, my love, Freddy, my love Freddy, you know your absence makes me feel so blue That's okay though, your presents make me think of you My mom will have a heart attack when she catches Those pedal pushers with the black leather patches Oh, how I wish I had a jacket that matches Freddy, my love, Freddy, my love, Freddy, my love, Freddy, my love Don't keep your letters from me, I thrill to every line Your spelling's kinda crummy, but honey, so is mine I treasure every gifty, the ring is really nifty You say it cost you fifty, so you're thrifty I don't mind, whoa-oh-oh-oh Freddy, you see, you'll hold me in your arms someday And I will be wearing your lacy lingerie Thinking about it, my heart's pounding already Knowing when you come home, we're bound to go steady And throw your service pay around like confetti I curse the night I watched you slip away Wouldn't have done no good to beg you to stay You were here beside me, but now you're gone I'm just tryin' hard to carry on But there's no rhythm in the rain There's no magic in the moon There's no power in this pain'Til somewhere between heaven and earth I can find you again Hearts are broken and dreams are lost But I made a promise to love at any cost Little did I know the price was so high Losing forever in the blink of an eye There's no rhythm in the rain There's no wishes in the stars There's no power in this pain'Til somewhere between heaven and earth I can hold you again If I could one more time Feel your hand in mine Hear your voice call my name Whisper sweet goodnight Yeah, then there'd be rhythm in the rain There'd be magic in the moon No such thing as love in vain And somewhere between heaven and earth You'd be with me again And I could see you again And I will hold you again, my baby Yeah, somewhere between heaven and earth Somewhere between heaven and earth Somewhere between heaven and earth I will see you againThere's been a lot of things said about me Since that awful day I'm not that person that I used to be And that I'll never be the same That's true - no doubt But I know more now what life is about I laugh louder Cry harder I take less time to make up my mind And I think smarter Go slower I know what I want and what I don't I'll be better than I've ever been Maybe I'll be better than I've ever been If someone told me twenty years ago That this would be my life I'd lose the greatest gift that love can show I'd have said - No, I won't survive But don't count me out Sometimes I'm stronger than I've ever felt I laugh louder Cry harder I take less time to make up my mind And I think smarter Go slower I know what I want and what I don't I'll be better than I've ever been Maybe I'll be better than I've ever beenI watch the news on tv The new breakthroughs in technology Can you find your way back Will you find your way back If they find water on the moon If they discover life of mars Does it mean you'll be home soon Can I hold you in my arms I used to believe in miracles There was a time when I could be So inspired by life's mystery Can I find my way back Will I find my way back If they find water on the moon If they discover life of mars Does it mean you'll be home soon Can I hold you in my arms I want to believe in miraclеs Oh I know you're somewherе Somewhere out there If I could go I'd be there I would be thereIf you were me what would you do You look in the mirror and it's not really you You fumble around for something to wear You feel invisible, you're not really there Would you think you were crazy And out of your mind You're not in your body You're living a lie There's a train in the station There's a car in the drive But they can't take me over the gender line No they won't take me over the gender line I knew about a young man in my little town Kept to himself and didn't run with the crowd Wicked secrets locked up in his head A vicious monster hiding under his bed There was no reason in anyone's mind What would posess him to take his own life There's a train in the station Planes lined up to fly But they couldn't take him over the gender line No they couldn't take her over the gender line Are you a boy or are you a girl It's an easy answer in a binary worldFlat on the floor my face to the ground I grumble a word but I make so sound Haven't you noticed that I disappeared I'm not here Boxes of photos are strewn on the bed Snapshots of memories fall out of my head Someone's existence has gone up in smoke It's my own Little pieces falling away Every day, every day Little pieces, little pieces Falling away My head in the clouds I stand in the rain I need to know if the rain feels the same Water is water as it hits my skin I breathe in Little pieces falling away Every day, every day Little pieces, little pieces Falling away Somedays I worry myself What will I become Remember I made up my mind to do what I've done Anyway it's too late now Get up off the floorSome may walk on the wild side Of course you can walk like a man I'm walkin' through this world As exactly who I am You can't see me now And you couldn't see me then But I'll keep walkin' through this world As exactly who I am You know I've done a great workaround all my life What you see is what you get But I grew tired of tryin' to fit a square peg in a round hole I want a life with no regrets Now my boots were made for walkin'I feel like I could walk around the sun My travels as a man in this world Have only just begun Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo, dooAll this soul chasin' ain't all it's cracked up to be I swear on my future grave it's gonna be the death of me Sometimes I think I must have done somethin' Gawd-awful In one of my previous lives and it keeps on comin' back to me Hey are you there In the sky or wherever the Grace lives I pray for some time Just to breathe, to find where my place is And please call me by my name Well I ran to my mama when I was four yеars of age Oh I cried in the kitchеn, Ma there's been some mistake She looked at me and smiled like she knew somethin' I didn't When I said I was born wrong, she said "Honey, you're just a little different."Well I had my own two kids but I raised only one That force that I reckon with took one to the sun Now since I last checked in there's been a little change My daughter said, "What do I call you, Ma " I said "Call me by my name!"Hey are you there In the sky or wherever the Grace lives I pray for some time Just to breathe, to find where my place is And please, please call me by my nameI felt the hot black tar beneath my shiftin' feet I heard the rumble of the fire before I felt the heat Like a moth to a flame, I felt my wings explode Now I find myself stumblin' down Purgatory Road I got a hole in my pocket and it's drivin' me mad I'm losin' every little bit of any sense I had I'm in a whole lot of trouble, it's a fact I know'Cause I can't see what's comin' down Purgatory Road Did I leave myself stranded Did I get myself lost There's no goin' back over All those lines I've crossed There's nothin' I can do now'Cept carry my own load And just keep on walkin' down Purgatory Road Down Purgatory Road I heard somebody whisper, I heard somebody shout There's nothin' you want down there and there's no way out But fools rush in and the wise man knows You best not get caught down Purgatory RoadI'm holding my own I'm doin' all right I'm finding my way through this curious life I don't understand Not even a clue But some days I think I do I felt this before when I sun comes up Lending it's light to the day When breathing comes easy And worry fades away It's all about healing the break It's all about healing the break A part of me's broken There's no doubt of that Like weeds in the sidewalk life grows in the cracks I'm not one on wishing for magical things But one sweet little red bird keeps flapping her wings I felt this before when I sun comеs up Lending it's light to the day When brеathing comes easy And worry fades away It's all about healing the break It's all about healing the break
