I've got the gift of one-liners And you've got the curse of curves And with this gift, I compose words And the question that comes forward Are you perspiring from the irony Or are you sweating to these lyrics And this just in, you're a dead fit But my wit won't allow it The inside lingo had me at hello And we go where the money goes The inside lingo had me at hello And we go where the money goes I want someone provocative and talkative But it's so hard when you're shallow as a shower And from what I've heard, with skin, you'll win Her bone structure screams, "Touch her  Touch her!"And she's got the curse of curves So with the combination of my gift with one-liners And my way, my way with words It seems I'm too hip to keep tight lipped And you're on the gossip team You're making something out of nothing And jealousy's the cousin, the cousin of greedWhat you got now gotta, gotta give it up What you got now gotta, gotta give it up What you got now, what you got now We keep ourselves a mystery But we provide, provide the clues So the rest is up to you And don't forget to check the obvious We are so serious So I guess it comes down to how curious you can be What you got now gotta, gotta give it up What you got now gotta, gotta give it up What you got now, what you got now Drama doesn't follow me, it rides on my back I may be ugly but they sure love to stare Drama doesn't follow me, it rides on my back I may be ugly but they sure love to stare And you check labels more than the F CC But these calories are, are killing me But this is a sticky situation So keep your chest in the game And drop your jaw and coax meAn old man gave me a tip, he said"Don't waste your time with politics", he said"Just chase skirts instead"And "Life is too short, and you're almost dead", he said"I met a woman once, gave her my best shot But never did I talk, and talk and talk If I had her back, I'd be real as my age I so don't blame them, I wouldn't do the same But I can blame them I'd sing her this”And you want to be dressed in poetry But imagery doesn't fit And you want resizing But darling, dear, get a grip And I think what I just wrote is going over my head I'm stealing lines from myself And what I said was never said It's just a lyrical lie Made up in my mind And you want to be dressed in poetry But imagery doesn't fit And you want resizing But darling, dear, get a gripAnd so typically And so typically Soft, set back and perfectly dropped Tough and learn and so perfectly taught I am as he does You are as she was And that's because And that's because But you never try But you never try'Cause conflict and make your top pick Restitch my ripped jeans And take the old ones And take the old ones out back Sew them tight at the seams, please I've got so many ripped knees, ripped knees I'm selfish as selfish comes You're giving me a run for my money Honey This is a hint that you take And you pull and you find a way out Of what you got yourself into But when you try But when you try to get out, you'll never find That most definitely I will be attracted to you If you pick my left side Because you know how we doI got birds in my ears And a devil on my shoulder And a phone to the other And I can't get a hold of her And what's a crush to do And what's a crush to do when he can't get through Medically speaking you're adorable And from what I hear you're quite affordable But I like them pricey So exaggerate and t-t-t-t-t-trick me Pretty please, just trick me Pretty please I got birds in my ears And a devil on my shoulder And a phone to the other And I can't get a hold of her And what's a crush to do And what's a crush to do when he can't get through I’m obsessed and stressed with this mess I can't think of things to write down, to type down And these fingertips are moving faster than these lips So you can only imagine how jealous my mouth isShe doesn't deserve to be in a place like this all alone She's under-age and so very very brave A fake I D lent her credibility She sits at the bar The gents are gonna try so hard He said it was a one night stand But the alcohol didn't let her understand Yeah, he said it was a one night stand A one night stand So what made you think That he couldn't find that door in the morning When he found that bed so easily in the dark So what made you think That he couldn't find that door in the morning When he found that bed so easily in the dark So the bartender who tends to pretend that he's concerned Says, "Girlie, girlie, you're at your best when you're sober"And she slurs, "No, no, just one more"And one turns into four The fourth drink instinct is taking over And the gentleman is leading her towards the doorThe roads are wrapped around your waist They lead me place to place I take trips from hip to hip In fact I've made a career out of it I've always thought the left was your strongest side But when it comes to you now I can't decide It's only a matter of time I need the product of your fears in the form of tears It's the only way I can survive It breaks my heart to see you crying, baby It's the only way I'll stay alive Green eyes, blue skies Natural disasters when she cries Green eyes, they're mine It's only a matter of time Like the climate, you never know what weather you get No denying you're the habit that I can't quit It's only a matter of mine I need the product of your fears in the form of tears It's the only way I can survive It breaks my heart to see you crying, baby It's the only way I'll stay alive Green eyes, blue skies Natural disasters when she cries Green eyes, they're mine It's only a matter of timeSwoon this is the same old blood rush with a new touch I am safe, quaint and eloquent But my bottom lip along with the top one, too Is chapped and it's all thanks to you We all wet our lips to prepare for the kiss But it never came And we all wet our lips to prepare for the kiss It was but a game You have a moan all of your own And I can feel it down to the bone You have a moan all of your own And I can feel it down to the bone You trained these lips when they were champs And now they're itchin' for a comeback So come back It's a shame that your claim to fame Hangs on someone else's name So come back Such a task and this is such a blast And such a task And such a task and this is such a blast And all that jazzYour face is a bit too My Space For my taste And sadly this is a new but classic Classic case Give them hell with that H TM LGive them hell Chatting way out on display They remember the things that I say Are my jeans too tight Does my blazer blaze Chatting way out on display Next comes the Photoshop To crop and cut To show those strangers just what You've been covered and covering up The shutter speed and the lighting that you need Give them hell with that H TM LGive them hellYou have a jump in your step But a rip in your, a rip in your rep And everybody knows it So be sure to be proud And don't forget you aren't allowed to brag I just gave myself the shivers And that's what you get when you think about her And I just gave myself the shivers And that's what you get, that's what you get With that façade you can do no wrong Many will enter but few will win So please, be sure to read the fine print I spend more time in front of mirrors Than any gent should because, let's face it One on one is more fun anyway And everybody knows it But I'm not so proud And I'll never be the one to brag To brag about how
