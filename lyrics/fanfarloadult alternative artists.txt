You can't trust that sand You're sleeping in all the time You'll see me on the screen Through all the other souls that I've bought with this oil Mexico says good night The tape machine is bust From all that spinning round and round I've scratched all my reels And bitten all my nails to the bone Like a stone, you'll come back when thrown up Away from the tar And away from the drills But kid I'm a pilot It's all I believe in It's all I believe in You can ride on my back With time on your hands You spent your mornings down by the tracks You had the drivers sign your arms My hospitals will welcome you home Like a tomb With godmothers aching to look at your grades And believe what you say But kid I'm a pilot It's all I believe in It's all I believe in You can ride on my backA moment of light A flare of day Before the door is closed again A tiny spark lost in the dark These tired symbols that dance around Let's go extinct End of the line I want to go I want to go Let's get misplaced All obsolete I want to go I want to go'Cause it's clear the wheels have turned We're standing in the way of ourselves The world will go on without us Yeah it's clear the world will go on without us And the dust will rearrange itself Oh the dust will rearrange itself again Who will take our place Be the new us I want to know I want to knowThey swallowed it whole, they went for the gold, for the gold We fall for the same lies we all have the same shoes to fit The preachers and books of your empire will fight here alone Some day the will be forgotten and die one by one The walls the walls are coming down The here and now is coming round It will some day let you down The ships the ships are coming in The great ideas are wearing thin There is nothing left to do For atoms have gone as far as atoms will go Your books write themselves They line up in row after row The walls the walls are coming down The here and now is coming round It will some day let you down The ships the ships are coming in The great ideas are wearing thin There is nothing left to doIt's all hats off now, all drum rolls and applause By slight of the hand, you will turn them into dust A face to face you will lead them by the fall A track fiend and the saw dust You're allowed to stare it out, ooh Ooh-ooh It's all good luck charms All trying to understand Indeed, inside me, we'll always hope for worse You say, keep them close by They're closer than you think A track fiend and the saw dust You're allowed to stare it out, ooh Ooh-ooh Next spring will bring you back again You'll sigh and crack a whip for us And maybe you will be the one Who'll drawl the line in the sand For us to crawlThey stayed put in their houses Or moved to higher grounds There are ghosts by the reservoir No one wants them round any more Theyve put a spell For the dam to break Theyll tell you all about the day when it came What it took away In 1922 It caused a drought It caused a flood It came to change us all for good Do I look like someone Ive heard the voices through the floor In a strange cold language Theyre planning out a war So tap into the mainline And tell me all the secrets Of a world you once lived in That your heart could not swallow The sky is so shallow Its late, youve been working hard Drive down to the reservoir It caused a drought It caused a flood It came to change us all for good Despite the years theyre still around Have we fallen out for good We've got minds behind our eyes Looking out at ourselves Things that grow Out of the ground Must one day Believe they’re real Each little cog Sticks to the next How can it be That they're alive This clever twist This pyramid scheme Has got you in A double bind Out of nothing making something like a cell Making patterns like a galaxy of cells These interactions or these consequences don’t Approximate it quite to make some kind of soul We have a contract, yeah we have each other's backs We made a promise but one day we'll fall apart Until the world gets tired of looking at itself We have a place A fighting chance While the chemicals Keep up their dance While our roots Are digging deep Trying to suck The whole place dryOh they hide it in their beds, they grow it in their sheds They serve it up in cups from overseas In the gardens in the trees And if were kicking up a fuss, its only cause we must Let the world begin to understand Begin to understand And so were running down our street, arms stretched out to the sky Antennas for the poison and the lies The delinquency of time Separated by a wall they had us build and raise Im waiting for the call
 I cant wait Luna, theyre coming down now And it was always on the cards Luna, the doors are open And you will have to start taking sides Luna, the doors are open You could not burn faster if you triedLook up, open the clouds Here comes the bombshell On the way home
And now we want the coal Confusing times Cry murder, cry what you like Just let the comets lead the way Well tear it down Well hold the truth by the neck Kick in the doors and burn the books Try to forget And wear it like flag Try to be patient On the way home Cause inside, behind every curtain They count the minutes, they count the days Well tear it down Well hold the truth by the neck Kick in the doors and burn the books Try to forget If you look at the horizon there is always something ducking out of sight When youre looking at the treetops and theyre scratching out their patterns in the sky Look up, open the clouds Here comes the bombshell On the way homeWait here for the flag to fall And follow me to the edge of town Your familys seen you on your bike All they say is its such a waste of time Stay clear of the runner up Hes got some tricks hes not afraid to try I stopped racing years ago I stopped listening  I stopped speaking The world has kept you on your toes Speak to me with your hands Ive got my friends safe in a cocoon But Ive read enough to know it will end Kerosene is my last line of defense Against all the rules Ive bent Im in the dark there, Im in the basement Thats where I keep them, thats where theyre buzzing Last year was a good year, I beat myself to a bloody mess But blue is the colour of the days Im hoping for What have you done to the mind you had Out there somewhere is the finish line I came to on a bed I must have been taken by surprise I must have lost my head!Speak to me, if you canEven though the lights have changed, I'm caught up in an endless loop Driving for ten hours and then ending up in the same place Can you hear a rumble underground, can you hear the beat Someone pacing round and round in circles on the floor above But we can still afford to not make sense at all But we can still afford to not make sense at all I see you wearing surgery rubber gloves, standing in the street Early in the morning, still awake but barely on your feet Oh we can still afford to not make sense at all Oh we can still afford to not make sense at all We spend our time with drowning men We're going to let ourselves get dragged down And now we're waiting And now we're stranded And now we're choking And now we're all Waiting And now we're stranded And now we're aching And now we're all Waiting And now we're stranded And now we're aching And now we're all Waiting And now we're stranded And now we're choking And now we're all
