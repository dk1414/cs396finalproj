know Will melt away And then a hero comes along With the strength to carry on And you cast your fears aside And you know you can survive So when you feel like hope is gone Look inside you and be strong And you'll finally see the truth That a hero lies in you It's a long road When you face the world alone No one reaches out a hand for you to hold You can find love If you search within yourself And the emptiness you felt Will disappear]Keepin' it real, son The shining star, you're my shining star, girl Yo, New York in the house Is Brooklyn in the house Uptown in the house Shaolin, are you in
