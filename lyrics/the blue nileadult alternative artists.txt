Sometimes I walk away When all I really wanna do is love and hold you right There is just one thing I can say Nobody loves you this way It's alright, can't you see The downtown lights In love we're

feel it How do I know it's true Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's alright Tonight and every night Let's go walking down this empty street Let's walk in the cool evening light Wrong or right, be at my side

tonight Tonight, tonight, yeah, tonightWhy did we ever come so far I knew I'd seen it all before Tall buildings reach up in vain Tinseltown is in the rain I know now love was so exciting Tinseltown in the rain, all men and women Here we are, caught up in this big rhythm One day this love will all blow over Time for leaving the parade Is there a place in this city A place to always feel this way And hey, there's a red car in the fountain Tinseltown in the rain, all men and women Here we are, caught up in this big rhythm Do I love you  Yes, I love you Will we always be happy go lucky Do I love you  Yes, I love you But it's easy come and it's easy go All this talking is only bravadoWorkin' night and day, I try to get ahead But I don't get ahead this way Workin' night and day, the railroad and the fence Watch the train go roll around the bend Over the hillside Over the moment Over the hills and waiting Workin' night and day, I try to get ahead Workin' night and day, don't make no sense Walk me into town, the ferry will be there To carry us away into the air Over the hillside Over white water Over the hills and falling The stars in your eyes Knowin' what's right The stars in your eyes Don't explainFrom a late night train Reflected in the water When all the rainy pavement lead to you It's over now I know it's over But I can't let go The cigarettes, the magazines All stacked up in the rain There doesn't seem to be a funny side It's over now I know it's over But I can't let go From a late night train The little towns go rolling by And people in the station going home It's over now I know it's over But I love you soWho do you love Who do you really love Who are you holding on to Who are you dreaming of Who do you love when it's cold and it's starlight When the streets are so big and wide, I love you An ordinary girl can make the world alright Love me all the way, Saturday night, Saturday night Quarter to five, when the storefronts are closed in paradise Meet me outside the cherry light, you and I walk away An ordinary girl will make the world alright She'll love me all the way, it's Saturday night Ordinary girl and all the coloured lights She'll love me all the way,

that shines Every single time I'm near you Where's the love that's all All I want is you Where is the love Where is the love I need love to be true Where's the light that shines Out among the neon signs Every single time I see you You're mine and only mine Where is the love Where is the love Ooh, baby, where's the love that shines Each time I fall for you It hurts me a little bit more Than I want it to I don't want it to, yeahI walk across the rooftops I follow a broken thread Of white rags falling slowly down Flags caught on the fences I am in love, I am in love with you I am in love, I am in love with you I walk across the rooftops The jangle of Saint Steven's bells The telephones that ring all night Incommunicado I am in love, I am in love with you I am in love, I am in love with you The traffic lights are changing The black and white horizon I leave the quiet Redstone And walk across the rooftops I walk across the rooftops On graduation day To look for independence, yeah I am in love, I am in love with you I am in love, I am in love with you
