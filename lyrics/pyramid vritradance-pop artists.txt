How've things been since we last met Around the time I last slept I heard you got a dude who treats you right and you're in love with him That kinda sucks, But I'm glad And as for me, I'm doing Grand Life couldn't be better since you up and left Grand Theft Cardiac Things were swell until you moved away in 10th grade And said that I would stay residing in your rib cage And now you pull this shit I tried to be with someone but she killed it And I left that bitch locked inside of my mother's basement Cause It didn't work So bitch don't you say another word If you were loved I'd put your satisfaction first But fuck that If I loved you any more I'd put you in a purple hearse While getting nookie, stealing lines from Frederick Durst But of curse I see we've lost worth in you We fell out Falling down the tubes Dirty Selsun blue I guess it's cool I never wanted to but I'll get over you Pulls out an invitation and I'm like, "This can't be fucking true.."Satan-eyed hufflepuffing tucked in dutch I'm climbing up the echelons B's slick thick with leaf grind And chief chipped like I'm old nas steam Rolled and she flat lined still Cold as my last beat she Gone and she nasty I'm Blown and she raspy Crafty amongst flyest It's drafty amongst the highest And I am if you're compliant I could put you onto science Niggas ride waves like sawtooth And they cut paste like in art school While we stay paved with them oz bricks And I stayed faded off wax hit...shit]I'm on a cloud I'm to familiar with, hoping that I don't fall down The buildings and the trees beneath my feet, what happens when I hit ground What rushes up always comes crashing down But take it slow you'll make it safe and soundHere's what I’ve been pondering: Downing 5ths of gin looking at your throat wonder if you're swallowing  Sinking even deeper into the shallow end tripping off of any little thing you get your mittens in  But you're so lovely I would like to court you  Fuck dates  Court you, dribble balls and hardwood floor you later  At the moment I kind of adore you, but talking isn't my forte foreplay upstairs, fuck stairs  Lights: kill 'em  Muffled sound layered over muffled sound playing in the under layer feel it in your underground layer to my underground lair and yes that shit is player but, starring, right, left  Tryna see that silhouette undressed, maybe if I get you high there wouldn't be a need for these Zelda gems tucked inside my vest pocket  Stop babbling get over there and talk  Stuck from this whatever the fuck I can't walk, where the hell am I  I thought this was a party  Shit I'm coming down to realize I haven't left the car seat  Wow I reach into my pocket for a wallet, absent  Substitute an unmarked key for room 210  Laced in strong perfumes a reddish hued kiss coupled with a number written down with a blue pen  Then  Timberrr  Answering the phone was her mother fucking sister  Now I'm confused  What am I gonna do  Not that I'm a perv but thinking 'bout 'chern make a nigga really wanna cum  But how the fuck did this happen  You're my fucking sister-in-law, well there ain't no in-laws in law, so...Swell, I thought you were the love of my life but all bitches are trife that's why I'm wielding this rifle  Said you were in like and took a nigga for granted now this nigga's making advancements all on my cabinet for attention you granted  Drenched in lust musk as I'm crying, grant a bitch trust now I'm dying to end it all  I’m hyped off Adderall and envy after seeing y'all  You said that you were saving it for marriage then let him raid your garden, steal the taters and the cabbage, while I was out tryna make cabbage  For us  SlutWell here we go again Mc Cloud that self reliant narcissist Tobacco flow but you niggas ain't spitting half as hard as this

but we know everybody knowsFrom the, children of the night klan kept within the dungeons at resident with light then arises a lucifarian mind with the soul of a darkie enlightened, hellishly a demon with a heartbeat, everevident in drums, wealth within the mind but a body in the slums, servants of nuns with guns and leaders who look at us as zeros and ones for fucking once, were our generation's last hope, but fuck it id rather be at a party tryna cum inside your girlfriends mouthpiece she's too drunk to remember hotter than december, this ugly bitch a winner in the right light, I'm excitebiking over whores on nintendo, compatible with wiimote, synced, prolly shoving shit into her disk drive, alcohol poisoning kill the mood and dismiss vibe, she cries, as the....But still

rape like its in season, scream the world sees it, calling the bitch sleezy standing with cocks greasy, cheerleading, following a cause without meaningBlue Diamonds shining Blind a basic bitch, lose her mind, her boyfriend copy mine like Simon Cut the chase, get ass exchange faces of dead government officials printed on tree shards I speak and bitches hop out their leotards Lick and split Dick in slit Nut and dip Cease communication Slag I hate rapping Distraction from gun capping Pimping and whore slapping, get this money mane Crept up in your motherfucking spot and left with everything Including your wife Told the bitch to leave the wedding ring, its regular Took the bitch shopping, ditched the bitch in the dressing room Slutty college waitress gave me brain on her break in the break room Back to the lab for preparation Cut it, break it down and ship it with all my mates Bitch im all about that cake, probably baked seeping down the street Ice cream paint fuck a job with your daughter on my knob Big booty bitches Coupled with four switches Powered by four midgets Bitch im going green Smoking tented purple leaves True to the regime of them wolves and Egyptian freaks Pyramids clouded up our reign releasing dopamine Salute the fuckingNiggas really thought that they could match the steez Dripping from the ladle tipping dreidel off this fucking brew Jamesons in my cup, umm Weed in my swisher, caps inside my chocolate verses make hoes go down like watergate By the lake around 11 after Tyler leaves I'm fucking you Leave and let these bitches brew, boiling in that cauldron causing ruckus yelling fuck em they don't touch us Cause we're touchless like brussel sprouts in the school cafe Thats prolly why these niggas hate, we droppin shit like U SA Change the game like nagasaki, radiating swag my wave Surf or get a raft my wave, smoking Howard Taft get a whiff from the draft When my niggas past drifting that Mc Laren I'm clean as Linwood Burton, inside berry sorbet Slipping in the kitchen with them chicken beats, make these cattle show them teets Spit it until my molars flee, drenched in all the finer things I'll drag em to the sea, until I burn to 33rd degree The valleys I escape emerging in this Unfamiliar color, petals roses, trees and things where Blank faced girls chase each other by waves wearing ocean breeze Nights of lows and sorrow dwell often in the mid day What can I be for me when I am Just what is clear no reason for pupils to show  Read what is said as it passes rewind and restart this If so, what I see is what you see  Our escapes now relate As we sail away you live in what we built during our stay where color clones of us roamed Where we stepped remembering what we've created is nice but what about once we've left Don't know lyricsWait until I pull up in that motherfucking Lotus Bitches blowing up my phone because now they see a nigga rolling My whole team shining and we never loose focus because we all we got From broke as fuck to selling out by pushing keys But wait until I pull up in that motherfucking Martin smoked up With a foreign bitch rolling up and she don't give a fuck Murdered out Take 'em to the South, kick 'em out then switch 'em out From broke as fuck to selling out by pushing keys Take a little piece of my heart again Go sew into the sleeves of my cardigan Oh pardon him and those bad manners That ape shit, we go bananas Got silk pajamas and a satin robe Cashmere from around the globe I'm getting brain that frontal lobe Yo, fuck the fame, I want the gold I'm not for sale, but I'm pretty much sold on the fact I'll never fucking do what I'm told I'm a hard head with great head giving rap lames them blank stares Got blank checks like Tone Loc We ball out like grown folk We inhale that gun smoke and Let 'em dieThese cosmic valleys are my vacate Submerging in this abyss of enlightenment to counter rules this earth lays Manifested through this stone and now I'm in these city lights Conversing with these riviera blondies living trippy lives Another night of deep ambitions, feels like my tomb is closer Loathing for successes that im suppose to reach indulge this culture Living time --through these silent voices on repeat and spin Sometimes I see the nearest lake and wish I could forget to swim Hence the unravelling of dimensions, realms and inner tombs Remembrance is pleasant but not achieved until we've reached our doom Its clouded much, fuchsia glowing like what you think heaven is Numerical conspiracies resurge this era's pets and kids Im up above these constellations from what was concocted underground Seeminglessly through sticks and stems I found me from just sand and crown Never down, floating movements, close my pupils, soul has risen Whispers from the nearest waters remind me of his past prisms Let's walk into the sea Come sink or swim with me The only way we'll seek peace Our prophecies are known Let's sail away and live the lives we used to live as clones
