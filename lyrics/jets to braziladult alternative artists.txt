Candle is blue, could see me through, I'm colorblind They tell me it's blue, I'm a believer, that's why I'm blind Live on the freeway, listen to signs, and we drive by feel Be a believer, believe everything, you'll be right half the time Candle is waxing, takes my apartment, I bask in its magic All of the firefighters put out my fires, took all my matches Staying up later, waking up old, and I'm leaving her never Ordering in, all friends and lovers And we're making our weather with a lone light bulb I'm tired of fighting, so I'm demolished, that's the way Some make exhaustion a mode of expression and that's their way I'm just a question knowing my answer, hope I'm wrong I know the answer, it's four in the morning, I'm right again I'm Chinatown Now in a hurry, rubbing up urgent to get home to dot Was my missed mistress, messed up my mattress, I missed the catch Last of the pitchers, catfish done hunting, Harry Lundt Most of the killers never get famous and it's hard on everyoneTasting you in rain, I walk down to the train Try not to look down This day could someday be an anniversary Everything is light and sound Facing forwards, going slowly, wait for you to show me Where this train wants to go Living by the hour, I stop for every flower Everything is soft and slow Now all these tastes improve Through the view that comes with you Like they handed me my life For the first time, it felt right Thank you for making me see there's a life in me It was dying to get out Holding you, we make two spoons beneath an April moon Everything is soft and sweet This cigarette, it could seduce A nation with its smoke Crawling down my tired throat Scratches part of me that's purring Softly stirringThe curtain's a sea anemone In the way it sways to the slow breeze I lie spread out on the floor, looking at these things Most of them are yours And it's so nice, sitting very still Without those old shoes I could never fill Starfish with its arms out in a daze Staring at the stars through an ocean haze Was I one you wished upon Burned out like a light bulb When you turned me on And it's so nice, sleeping here all alone With my ashtray White courtesy telephone Now I'm making out the shapes Like the shower rod — can it take my weight I will tell you I am fine I got some news, friend Feels like I'm dying Turtle on its back in the desert sea And you look like a cool drink, just slightly out of reach Draw myself into the shell Waiting on a sign from God or a nod from hellI live in a hotel, I must keep writing If I'm to be better than everyone else Like figure skating, like asphyxiating On your own seeping fumes, you're just waiting Living in a hotel, I'm not traveling Between two points, in midair I'm levitating Above the earth, beneath the sky, with eyes like static In my three feet from bed to wall sleeps a genius Leave me here to my devices The call could come at any time They're playing love songs on the radio tonight I can't relate to that right now Note to self, no one cares, your voice is average In worried piles I typed for miles, you just stood there I will begin, I will put right this morning terror I have been kissed between the ears with human error Leave me here to my devices I need a word to change my life I've tied my ankles to the table legs with wire He can't write so much as type Leave me here to my devices I can't think with all this noise They're playing love songs on your radio tonight I don't get those songs on mineMorning new disease, charcoal in bed Bone soaked, anemic, listen in horror To the scraping of flatware and china And saran wrap to stifle libido Air shaft, a chasm, their lives flung open Sickness is a time for hating your neighbors In their milk flats with five kids too many Having day sex because they're all daughters And you're thinking the same two things Over and over again I am dreaming of a life I am dreaming of waking up There's this anger rising cancer in me, standing like a wall Between the waking world I seek and this infected plane of sleep Love, come like an axe to all this ice and set me free There's a black rewarding book beneath this stiff sheet, if you look carefully Noise, police, white hearse, T V air wave, methadone Diet, contact, safe sex, antibiotic For your safety, we've taken sharp objects It's their object to keep you from waking Taste test serenade, we dig the grave Lose weight astrologically, no money down For your enjoyment, we've excised the dialogue For your protection, we've installed this cameraBlooming black flower wine Slashed arms and new cut smiles Taller for the falling down Stronger now without you'Round, 'round The prophecies were realized When we gave them proper time All truth comes to light After lies have had their Night, night And it's hard without you But it's harder not to doubt you You're so polite I'm too uptight You've grown more beautiful Since you took off What can I do  I'm in love with you And it won't stop You're the one I want You're the one I want Cookie crumbs and alcohol Crooked hands, the band's on hold'Cause your shoulders make me old Your concerns leave me Cold, coldWe are the high street service trays coming to take you away Pasadena '68, with speed on your breakfast plate Aunt cancer calls them happy pills They keep her calm and cool until he leaves The moccasin skin obsession leather thigh White tennis skirt so high The eyes of nine are new and kind when the hair's not gray, it's white And grandpa burns an ascot noose Can't tie the tassels on his shoes, leave me Oh god, stop tearing off the roof Of my experimental bathroom It's the only thing that's halfway mine And not for your prying or lying eyes These are the red-eyed politics, the cocktail revisionists War room rules, no wives or kids, hear men sing the boy in them The hedge casts heroes late across the lawn, the valley hunt militia men all gone Thought we had the lock in '54, now the maid owns the house next door, what's more Swims in the pool she used to clean Our new king looks like a queen Leave me The empire's melting like ice cream On the altar of the sun This skin we've stretched for centuries It's faded, it's fraying, it's meaningless to meStarry configurations, I'm just a receiver Divine recombinations, I'm just a recordist Receptionist, unhappy medium Receptionist, unhappy medium Excellent accommodations, I'm just a bellboy Beautiful surroundings, I'm just some gravel Or peat moss, what have you Or peat moss, what have you now Why must you treat me like you do Don't you know it's all for you Dear infatuation, you do not see me Die here beside you in see-through obscurity Governess, fancy-less We'll sound the alarm Drum up some simpleton for you To eat these apples from your eyesKnow that you'll soon go crazy, just like a whittling stick Hit by the coming daylight, cut up in a quick succession A pointed confession, really stripped of all your armor Down to your very nature Beneath the haze and vapor gaze You're such a willing stick to beckon that wanting knife And you've been looking for it — the right blade — all your life Saying who's gonna cut me down to a size that suits me Is there a worthy sculptor among all you fine young knives It's enough to make you take your head and put it on a shelf To cut the heart out from your chest Now they'll come for that as well Tell me how you do that crazy trick where you walk around asleep Save it for your doctor friend, the one who keeps you under lock and key You'll soon go screaming like a bargain basement lunatic Who's not so specialized that they couldn't just replace you Why don't you start crying for all that you've got left here Why don't you stop dying before you go and get it right Now you're selling off the house so you can buy the farm You cut that heart out from your chest to let the light in through your armDo you know what would be good right here Some yellow A touch of humility; original sin or two from you Half the math, double the myth; they told you to No aftertaste, no residue Chop chop, you're through Our good order taker has what it takes to make it It's up to you Unflinching trigger finger Coffee fetcher to the letter See it through Riddles don't stupefy because at the moment We want to not know you to better know you Don't be so German Pick it up; prick up the usual amount No fingerprints, no proper names Our finest scotch to wash it down Good French collaborator, we heard you make great waiters Make us proud No job too small or messy Your lack of feeling, pleasing We'll keep you around
