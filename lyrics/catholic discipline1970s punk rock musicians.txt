must fall On the bathroom mirror On this spotty mattress I will lay for hours Adding up all my sins And inventing new ones I'm proud of my life And I stand by my doom I can't tell right from wrong It's never stopped me All the prophets have died The books have been written Starvation in a jar We laugh so hard it hurtsThis is a true story You’re so pink and you’re so smooth My Barbie Doll

of my pocket I rub for your blond hair And you try to bite me And you try to bite me And you try to bite me Plastic is fantastic Tiny bits of plastic Tiny bits of plastic Barbie doll lust it’s not normal Barbie doll lust it’s not normal Barbie doll lust it’s not normal When no one is looking I gently pull you out Holding you by the neck Your legs between my knees Your minute eyelashes flicker
