good was good enough for me Good enough for me and my Bobby Mc Gee From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun Yeah, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it But I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mineOh, come on, come on, come on, come on Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man  Yeah An' didn't I give you nearly everything that
