Put on my blue suede shoes And I boarded the plane Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues In the middle of the pouring rain W.C  Handy Won't you look down over me Yeah I've got a first class ticket But I'm as blue as a boy can be Then I'm walking in Memphis I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale Walking in Memphis But do I really feel the way I feel Saw the ghost of Elvis On Union Avenue Followed him up to the gates of Graceland Then I watched him walk right through Now security they did not see him They just hovered around his tomb But there's a pretty little thing Waiting for The King Down in the Jungle RoomWatched it coming up Winslow Down South Park Boulevard Yeah it was looking good from tail to hood Great big fins and painted steel Man it looked just like the Batmobile With my old man behind the wheel Well you could hardly even see him In all of that chrome The man with the plan and the pocket comb But every night it carried him home And I could hear him saying Don't you gimme no Buick Son you must take my word If there's a God in Heaven He's got a silver Thunderbird You can keep your Eldorados And the foreign car's absurd Me I wanna go down In a silver Thunderbird Got up every morning While I was still asleep But I remember the sound of him shuffling around Right before the crack of dawn Is when I heard him turn the motor on But when I got up they were goneBaby I've been searching like everybody else Can't say nothing different about myself Sometimes I'm an angel and sometimes I'm cruel But when it comes to love I'm just another fool Yes I'll climb a mountain I'm gonna swim the sea There ain't no act of God, girl Could keep you safe from me My arms are reaching out Out across this canyon I'm asking you to be my true companion True companion True companion So don't you dare and try to walk away I've got my heart set on our wedding day I've got this vision of a girl in white Made my decision that it's you alright When I take your hand I'll watch my heart set sail I'll take my trembling fingers And I'll lift up your veil Then I'll take you home And with wild abandon Make love to you just like a true companion You are my true companion I got a true companion Whoa, a true companionRock of ages let our song Praise your saving power Thou amidst the raging foes You were our sheltering tower Our sheltering tower Rock of ages let our song Praise thy saving power Thou amidst the raging foes You were our sheltering tower Our sheltering tower Furious they assailed us But thine arm availed us And thy word broke their sword When our own strength failed us And your word broke their sword When our own strength failed us Oh rock of ages, oh yeah Children of the wanderers Whether free, whether free or fettered Wake the echoes, wake the echoes of the songs Where you may be scattered Where you may be scattered Oh yeah Everybody talks about some fateful day And I guess that this was mine I may be here to tell some kind of story But I think it's gonna take a little time See I'm rockin' in a cradle Down the hall somewhere and I amâ€”Lost inside a dream Maybe I am falling Maybe I am flying But I know if I am crying she is Holding me And then the sky broke up And then the rain came down And it washed away everything on the ground Wash it away Wash it away Wash it awayI was sitting with Mary In my dad's blue Valiant Rain was coming down And the radio was playing Mary was talking A million miles a minute I could not hear one word she was saying'Cause I was lost I was gone Listening to Levon In another world Oh, in another place I was lost I was gone Listening to Levon I was looking in Mary's eyes But I was listening to Levon Mary's hair was black That much I remember Mary's skin was smooth I remember that too And she'd open her eyes Sometimes when she kissed me I don't know why she did that Maybe Mary knewI finally see your face In my rear-view mirror With each mile I put between us The road keeps gettin' clearer I only wish that I could make a quiet getaway Probably think I'm fooling myself That I just want to have my fun But leaving you believe me Is the first good deed I've done I'm only want to save you From more heartache if I stay'Cause baby if I, if I, if I were an angel Baby if I, if I, if I were an angel Baby if I, if I, if I were an angel I would have earned my wings today I didn't get a message From anyone on high And I don't get instructions On who to save and why No heavenly connections sent me down this wayI'm writing you this letter from some old hotel I can feel the distance between us From the Spanish Steps to the Liberty Bell I know the angels have seen us They can see us baby They see you down on Seventh Avenue While you're just hanging by a thread And I'm sitting in a lonely room without a view Wishing I was there with you instead Won't you walk through this world with me Walk through the world Over the miles of mystery Walk through this world with me I'm staring out across the rooftops, baby I've seen the writing on the wall Heard a little bit of thunder at the seventh wonder And everything is bound to rise and fall That's allLet's go down to the sound tonight Tide is low and we can walk on water Reel me in under that starry light Just like the fisherman's daughter Baby when the bands and the barkers go home They say that Venus she rises from out of the foam She dances on air and laughs at the moon And watches young lovers in fiery dunes So are you willing to wait for the miracle Willing to wait it through Are you willing to wait for the miracle Or don't you believe they're true There's an old man sitting by the side of the pier He's got his cross and his camera and his bottle of beer He just sits all day and all through the night Praying for a vision or a heavenly light'Cause he's willing to wait for the miracle Willing to wait it through He's willing to wait for the miracle What else is he gonna do What else is he gonna do  I don't know much about you I don't know who you are We've been doing fine without you But we could only go so far Don't know why you chose us Were you watching from above Is there someone there that knows us Said we'd give you all our love Will you laugh just like your mother Will you sigh like your old man Will some things skip a generation Like I've heard they often can Are you a poet or a dancer A devil or a clown Or a strange new combination of The things we've handed down I wonder who you'll look like Will your hair fall down and curl Will you be a mama's boy Or daddy's little girl Will you be a sad reminder Of what's been lost along the way Maybe you can help me find her In the things you do and say And these things that we have given you They are not so easily found Oh but you can thank us later For the things we've handed down The things we've handed down Down, down, down, down, down, down
