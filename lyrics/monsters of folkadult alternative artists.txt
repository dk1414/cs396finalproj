There's a map of the world on the wall in your room Green pins where you wanna go White pins where you've been, there isn't even ten And you're already feeling old Pretty faces stare back from the magazine stack That you read when you're feeling bored Look through a telescope lens, it doesn't make sense You think you've been there before Some far off feeling, some up close kind of ache A wide screen reason to look the other way There's a place by the lake that you go when it's late In the summer when the crowds are gone And you sit all alone with your thoughts getting stoned Just waiting for some peace to come Like the thing that you tried that you thought that you liked For a minute then it all felt wrong So you change it again, all your clothes, all your friends It's the same as it ever wasDear God, I'm trying hard to reach you Dear God, I see your face in all I do Sometimes it's so hard to believe in Good God, I know you have your reasons Dear God, I see you move the mountains Dear God, I see you moving trees Sometimes it's nothing to believe in Sometimes it's everything I see Well I've been thinking about And I've been breaking it down without an answer I know I'm thinking aloud but if your loves Still around why do we suffer Why do we suffer Dear God, I wish that I could touch you How strange sometimes I feel I almost do And then I'm back behind the glass again Oh God, what keeps you out it keeps me in Well I've been thinking about And I've been breaking down without an answer I know I'm thinking aloud but if your loves Still around why do we suffer Why do we suffer Putting on my power, righteous as a rose Dynamite the mountain, now I'm walking up the road, ah The love we made at gunpoint wasn't love at all The dancing in the valley, the moon's the mirror ball Blew open my mind, now it's an empty room Swinging in the hammock, dogs are walking across the roof, ah I watch you braid your hair, you're from another time When the earth wasn't so angry, and God was on our side Searching west and east And all points in between Underneath the lines of thought You're there and then you're not The mayans stole tomorrow, hid it underground We come with heavy magnets but it still hasn't been found, ah I'm sweating out my secrets in the temazcal They're screaming in the calle that there are stars about to fall Looking through the trees Cities and the seas Things we've seen, O VN ID S on the lawn They're there and then they're goneComing home alone at night, I'm so scared Turn on all the lights, check underneath the stairs Open all the closets, make sure they're no monsters in there Living in a small house, it's fairly easy to check If I were living in a mansion, I'd probably just sleep out on the deck Heaving on the boulder, just trying to move it an inch I think I'm getting closer, I think I'm getting bolder, but then it all starts to slip And I keep making the same old faces again Partying with strangers or sticking with close friends instead It don't matter what you're doing, as long as you're losing your head Out riding the range, or laying with you here in bed It don't matter what I'm doing, as long as I'm losing my head Way back when the smallest trip was the greatest quest Now sometimes I get bored, even though I know I'm blessed Coming and going like we do it's hard to keep friends I know firsthand I'm tired of doing nothing, feel like we should be making plans We need a little thrill, I can see it in our faces, yeah, turn off the tv set The feeling of adventure, I think we all remember it'Nother perfect day They keep piling up I got happiness That I can maintain some beginner's luck I had shoes to fill Walking barefoot now Can't tell north from south But no split hair's gonna get me down I'm staying 'bove the flat line I'm ahead of the curve Take a piece of the sunshine with me On a red eye flight to another world It isn't any trouble If you wanna come with me I know it's out of the question, honey But I sure could use the company And a place to be Now the sky is pink Rooftop swimmin' pool I'm not carefree, no I'm free to care, I just never doDon’t ever buy nothing from a man named Truth Don’t ever buy nothing from a man named Truth I’ll tell you right now that it ain’t no use Don’t ever buy nothing from a man named Truth Pain was hunting me down but I gave him the slip I left the city through a tunnel and I headed for the styx With oregeno oil in the morphine drip Pain was a-hunting me down but I gave him the slip And I fell in love with identical twins They lived thirty-four summers between the two of them I gave one my ego, I gave one my id Yeah, I got to get back to my pretty little twins Don’t ever buy nothing from a man named Truth Don’t ever buy nothing from a man named Truth I’ll tell you right now that it ain’t no use Don’t ever buy nothing from a man named Truth I was lost for a year in those almond trees The sun was rising in the south and setting in the east I was a half awake, I was half asleep I thought I’d never get out of those almond trees And don’t think too slow in syruppy the sun You’ll get buried alive when the caterpillar comes Tapping your time on congo drums Just don’t think too slow in the circling sunEveryone grows old on the gold coast It takes a lot of hope to grieve Everyone gets dark and the worst part Is the way those thoughts can please you Personality like a split screen See yourself down your knees Hold out your hand Hold out your hand, darling Hold out your hand Say please Everyone gives up down on hard luck On hope ain't enough it seems Everyone gets lost in their own fog Have to wonder on with lantern dreams Say please, please Just say something Speak up, please If it's what you're looking forDo you like where you're living  Do you like what you do Do you like what you're seeing when you're lookin' at you Do you like what you're saying when you open your face Do you got the right feeling  Are you in the right place Stealin' a tusk from an elephant Must make one feel creepy inside And although you'll boast around the fire at night That ghost will kick up a fight"Be gone  Be gone ", you scream You're just some elephant dream I needed you like you needed me People, they need piano keys If you like where you're living, if you like what you do If you like what you're seeing, when you're lookin' at you If you like what you're saying, when you open your face Then you got the right feeling, you're in the right place"Is this right  Is this right "Come on God answer tonight Is there some fee that you'll charge me For doin' what you thought I might I learned a good way, good way I learned a good way, good way I learned a good way of saying goodbye I learned a good way, good way I learned a good way, good way You taught me everything I know about Taking other people for a ride And I just wanted to take the time To thank you for that gift tonight I learned a good way, good way I learned a good way, good way I learned a good way of saying goodbye I learned a good way, good way I learned a good way, good way You taught me everything I know about Taking other people for a ride And I just wanted to take the time To thank you for that gift tonight Yes, we'll drive out to the forest And wait 'til the moon is up above We'll smear mud and pomegranate seeds on our faces Build a giant fire and wait for the sun to put it out We'll be fed and nourished back to health by our surrogate animal parents You'll eat berries from the bushes I'll learn to fly and you'll learn to fish And I'll fly down to the river to join you And when we're strong and healthy and ready We'll return to the human world with new skills and a new perspective We'll be free Yours, alwaysSlow down Jo Anybody ever tell you that you move too fast Anybody ever tell you how to make a good thing last'Cause it ain't like that First you gotta slow down Jo Last night I was talking to some friends of mine A.J.'s afraid you're gonna kill your time Or lose your mind If you don't slow down Jo Anybody ever tell you if you lose the knack Anybody ever tell you that it's true You can get it back Oh, but not like that It ain't by kicking down the walls Pissing off your friends Every time the cards don't fall your way It ain't by poking out your eyes When you see something you don't like Even your mama said she don't want to see you spent at 25
