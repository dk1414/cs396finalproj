This ain't no temporary, typical, tearful goodbye This ain't no breakin' up, then wakin' up and makin' up one more time This is gone , gone , gone , gone Gone like a freight train Gone like yesterday Gone like a soldier in the Civil War Bang Bang!Gone like a '59 Cadillac Like all the good things, that ain't never comin' back She's gone , gone , gone , gone She's gone!This ain't no 'give it time, I'm hurtin' but maybe we can work it out'Won't be no champagne, red rose, romance, second chance This is gone , gone , gone , gone Gone like a freight train Gone like yesterday Gone like a soldier in the Civil War Bang Bang!Gone like a '59 Cadillac Like all the good things, that ain't never comin' back She's gone , gone , gone , gone She's gone There's a story that my daddy tells religiously Like clockwork every time he see's an opening In a conversation, 'bout the way things used to be Well I just roll my eyes and make a B-line for the door But I'd always end up starry eyed and cross legged on the floor Hanging onto every word, man the things I heard It was harder times and longer days Five miles to school uphill both ways We were cane-switch raised and dirt floor poor Course that was back before the war Yea your uncle and I made quite a pair Flying F-15's through hostile air He went down but they missed me by a hair He'd always stop right there and say That's something to be proud of That's a life you can hang your hat on As your chins held high as the tears fall down Gut sucked in, chest stuck out Like a small town flag a flying Or a new born baby crying In the arms of the woman that you love That's something to be proud ofI'm getting older Finding myself and God getting a little bit closer And Sober I'm a little less reckless, little less wild card Breaking hearts kinda senseless Yeah, I'm coming around I might cuss and fight, tell a few lies Break a few rules, making promises I can't keep But I've turned the page on wilder days I'm writing all this down hoping you'll see I ain't saying I'm perfect, but I'm working on a better me I say I'm sorry Sometimes it's the hardest part to tell somebody But baby I'm sorry Yeah I've been praying Coming from me that might sound a little bit crazy But I swear I'm changing I might cuss and fight, tell a few lies Break a few rules, making promises I can't keep But I've turned the page on wilder days I'm running all this down hoping you'll see I ain't saying I'm perfect, but I'm working on a better me yeahHe works way too much For way too little He drinks way too early 'til Way too late He hasn't had a raise Since New Year's Day In eighty-eight Gets trampled on by everyone, 'cept When he comes in here And he's the product Of the Haggard generation He's got a redneck side When you get him agitated He got the gold toothed look From a stiff right hook He's proud he took For his right wing stand on Vietnam Says he lost his brother there He yells out Johnny Cash And the band starts to play A-ring of fire as he walks up And stands there by the stage And he saysI have days where I hate my job This little town and the whole world too And last Sunday when my Bengals lost Lord, it put me in a bad mood I have moments when I curse the rain But then complain when the sun's too hot I look around at what everyone has And I forget about all I've got But I know I'm a lucky man God's given me a pretty fair hand Got a house and piece of land A few dollars in a coffee can My old truck's still runnin' good My ticker's tickin' like they say it should I've got supper in the oven, a good woman's lovin'And one more day to be my little kid's dad Lord knows I'm a lucky man Got some friends who would be here fast I could call 'em any time of day Got a brother who's got my back Got a mama who I swear's a saintThere's a for sale sign on a big old rusty tractor You can't miss it, It's the first thing that you see Just up the road, a pale blue water tower With "I Love Jenny" painted in bright green Hey that's my Uncle Bill there by the courthouse He'll be lowering the flag when the sun goes down And this is my town Yeah this is my town Hey!Where I was born Where I was raised Where I keep all my yesterdays Where I ran off cause I got mad And it came to blows with my old man Well I came back and settled down It's where they'll put me in the ground Yeah this is My town Yeah this is My town My townGolden Tee, shuffleboard, pinball, he's got the score That everybody around here's tryin to beat He's a six pack up when he walks in Tells the band crank it up to 10 Then he's up dancin on his seat Well he's a big mouth, yellin' hey play some free bird Says give me three steps and nobody gets hurt Then he takes off his shirt There's one in every crowd Brings the party in us out Good time Charley with a Harley, whiskey bent and hellbound He's got the next round, but he always drinks for free There's one in every crowd, and it's usually me Hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd Got a fliptop box of Marlboros He'll bum a light and steal your girl Then laugh at you for gettin' all upset, well everybody here knows his name Makes everybody else look sane When he's out, as far as you can get In his mind he's a rock star, crankin' out that air guitar Til the bartender says fool, get off my bar There's one in every crowd That brings the party in us out Good time charley with a harley, whiskey bent and hellbound He's got the next round, but he always drinks for free There's one in every crowd, and it's usually me Hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowdI heard it through the grapevine My new neighbor Don't like my big red barn A '47 Ford Bullet holes in the door Broke down motor in the front yard, ha ha I got half a mind to paint a plywood sign And nail it up on a knotty pine tree Saying I was here first This is my piece of dirt And your rambling don't rattle me Some people care about What other people think Worry 'bout what they say Let a little gossip Comin' from a loose lip Ruin a perfect day Sayin' blah, blah, blah Just-a jackin' their jaws Gotta let it roll off-a my back I don't give a dern What other people think What do ya think about that Granddaddy was Irish Cherokee Ran moonshine from here to Tennessee Spent half his life in the Montgomery county jail Grandma, she got drunk and left All her kids on her mamas front steps Nobody's heard from her since she hightailed I come from a long line of losers Half outlaw, half boozers I was born with a shot glass in my hand I'm part hippie, a little redneck I'm always a suspect My blood line made me who I am Daddy never finished school But he shot one mean game of pool Took a bullet for stealin' cars down in Birmingham Mama always went to church But we soon found out what her reasons were She got caught at the local motel with the preacher man I come from a long line of losers Half outlaw, half boozers I was born with a shot glass in my hand I'm part hippie, a little redneck I'm always a suspect My blood line made me who I amCane poles hanging out of a four door window Bucket full of minnows in the front floorboard Box full of greasy cold fried chicken livers A day on the river's what I live for Got the radio playing and my boat while I float Take a toke and I listen to Merle Hot sun, cold one, I'll be a son of a gun I'm king of the world They grow big gators in South Louisiana My neighbors in the swamp take an evening nap Shoo fly, shoo fly, Polk salad Annie Listen to the bull frogs hip-hop rap I got a pretty thing waiting downtown I'm in love with a green eyed girl I'm gonna catch me a fish, go home, get a kiss Why yes I'm king of the world Got a stringer full of bass and a hookie in my finger Sun burnt face and a Tylenol buzz Take the good with the bad and the bad with the better The weather isn't bad so better not cuss
