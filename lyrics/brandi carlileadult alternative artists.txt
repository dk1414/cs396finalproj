You're feeling nervous, aren't you, boy With your quiet voice and impeccable style Don't ever let them steal your joy And your gentle ways, to keep 'em from running wild They can kick dirt in your face Dress you down, and tell you that your place Is in the middle, when they hate the way you shine I see you tugging on your shirt Trying to hide inside of it and hide how much it hurts Let 'em laugh while they can Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends And the joke's on them You get discouraged, don't you, girl It's your brother's world for a while longer You gotta dance with the devil on a river To beat the stream Call it living the dream, call it kicking the ladder They come to kick dirt in your face To call you weak and then displace you After carrying your baby on your back across the desert I saw your eyes behind your hair And you're looking tired, but you don't look scaredAll of these lines across my face Tell you the story of who I am So many stories of where I've been And how I got to where I am But these stories don't mean anything When you've got no one to tell them to, it's true I was made for you I climbed across the mountaintops Swam all across the ocean blue I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules But baby, I broke them all for you Oh, because even when I was flat broke You made me feel like a million bucks, you do I was made for you You see the smile that's on my mouth It's hiding the words that don't come out And all of our friends who think that I'm blessed They don't know my head is a messA love song was playing on the radio It made me kind of sad because it made me think of you And I wonder how you're doing, but I wish I didn't care Because I gave you all I had and got the worst of you By the way, I forgive you After all, maybe I should thank you For giving me what I've found'Cause without you around I've been doing just fine Except for any time I hear that song And didn't it break your heart when you watched my smile fading Did it ever cross your mind that one day the tables would be turned They told me the best revenge would be a life well lived And the strongest one that holds would be the hardest one to earn By the way, I forgive you After all, maybe I should thank you For giving me what I've found'Cause without you around I've been doing just fine Except for any time I hear that song Oh, any time I hear that song Waiter send this to the table, the party of one The only other lonely soul in this place And so you're finishing up your coffee But then where're you gonna run Where'd you get that look on your face You should always let the sun go down on your anger Let it burn you to sleep Bring it closer to danger To surrender and retreat Sing your sad soul to sleep I loved you the first time I saw you And you know I love you still But I am tired And I am yours Don't even think about your freedom or taking that flight Or going back upon your promise after fighting for the right Because your eggshells and your "I" statements and your weaponized words Are paper tigers now Oh your constant overthinking and your secretive drinking Are making you more and more alone And girl, you can slam the door behind you, it ain't never gonna close Because when you're home, you're already homeI run a lot of miles of life and crime And mountain climbs and quittin' times Packing that load of lyin' rhymes And tired jokes and wooden dimes I've been everybody's friend, everybody's friend I could lose my house, I could steal a car I could serve two masters, living hard Living like a dog in a cage in a yard With a fist full of cold hard cash that I can't let go The devil can't have my soul, the devil can't get your soul The devil can't get your soul Hold out your hand Take hold of mine and then Round and round we go Don't you wanna dance I'm a dying man From the moment we began Hold out your hand Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da Ba da da, ba da da, ba da daThey build wooden houses on frozen ponds In the summertime when the water's gone Diagonal lines in their rolled-out lawns And the sage always smells so pretty But nobody cares where the birds have gone When the rain comes down on Babylon The stone mason's phone rings all day long And you gotta get back to the city I'll build my house up on this rock, baby Every day with you There's nothin' in that town I need After everything we've been through Me out in my garden and you out on your walk Is all the distance this poor girl can take Without listenin' to you talk I don't need their money, baby Just you and me on the rock You and me on the rock I built paper planes when I learned to fly Like a 747 fallin' out of the sky I folded 'em crooked, now I'm wonderin' why I could always end up in the water But nobody's askin' why she lookin' so thin Why she laughin' too hard or why she drinkin' again A fallen star, she's a paper plane She was goin' down when you caught herCome back now, even if you call me out You might be angry now, of course you are I'm scared too, didn't mean to take it out on you I know I always do, you're the strongest person in the room Turn back time, help me to rewind and we can Find ourselves again It's not too late Either way, I lose you in these silent days It wasn't right But it was right on time Don't look down I can feel it when your heart starts pounding It's beyond your control, you know it is It's getting to the point where I can't carry on I never held my breath for quite this long And I don't take it back, I did what I had to do It's not too late Either way, I lose you in these silent days It wasn't right But it was right on timeWelcome to the end of being alone inside your mind You're tethered to another and you're worried all the time You always knew the melody but you never heard it rhyme She's fair and she is quiet, Lord, she doesn't look like me She made me love the morning, she's a holiday at sea The New York streets are as busy as they always used to be But I am the mother of Evangeline The first things that she took from me were selfishness and sleep She broke a thousand heirlooms I was never meant to keep She filled my life with color, canceled plans, and trashed my car But none of that was ever who we are Outside of my windows are the mountains and the snow I hold you while you're sleeping and I wish that I could go All my rowdy friends are out accomplishing their dreams But I am the mother of Evangeline And they've still got their morning paper and their coffee and their time And they still enjoy their evenings with the skeptics and the wine Oh, but all the wonders I have seen, I will see a second time From inside of the ages through your eyes You are not an accident where no one thought it through The world has stood against us, made us mean to fight for you And when we chose your name we knew that you'd fight the power too You're nothing short of magical and beautiful to me Oh, I'll never hit the big time without you So they can keep their treasure and their ties to the machine'Cause I am the mother of EvangelineHe wasn't really known for breaking the rules When he arrived in the second year of my high school He wasn't so much of a twist of fate As a short turn up from a Southern state He was born with a sweet tooth he couldn't beat Always trying to find himself something sweet All that he found was the trouble and me Or maybe trouble just found him It was hard to hide that his heart had scars He would stay up late talking to the stars People tried to blame him for making bad choices When he was only listening to the voices And searching for some kind of deeper truth Between the lines and the Bible and living proof There's no point now to judge him in vain If you haven't been there, you don't know the pain He was a liar, but not a fraud Living proof that there was no God Just the Devil stiff as a rod A slave to a sugartoothIf I don't owe you a favor, you don't know me I don't believe we've ever even met If there's a God in heaven, you can show me Then I guess I should admit I lost the bet There are moments I could hold you forever And there are moments that lasted way too long There are days when I change with the weather To hold you in place would be wrong There's a road left behind me that I'd rather not speak of And a hard one ahead of me, too I love you, whatever you do But I got a life to live, too I never met a morning I could get through With nothing on my breath to hold the night And I never said I'm sorry, but I meant to I never met a coward I don't like There are reasons why a body stays in motion But at the moment, only demons come to mind There are days when I could walk into the ocean With no one else but you to leave behind
