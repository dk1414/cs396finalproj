Drop everything you're doing Drop a needle on the groove And dance with me slow Like Times Square New Years Eve, yeah Think I heard a drop, on the tin roof, baby Drop, those blinds What you say we ride this thunderstorm out And drop what we were fighting about What goes up, baby, must come down We've been holding this in like rain in a cloud Call off your army, make me a mess, girl Nothing disarms me like seeing that dress Drop just a little more With a black lace trail Take it out on me, and leave Go to hell on the bedroom floor Drop back in time to good morning Back to back love, girl Let's get back to that us We don't have to apologize Just put your lips on my lips Let's start from the top It's the only way to save what we've gotA drunk girl's mood, the shape of the moon That know it all teenage attitude The price of gas, the price of smokes Nah, they don't stay the same All the things that froze in time 'round here We still go to church and then drink Beer Some things do but some things never change We still light one up, we still raise some hell We still show up drunk to somethin' thinkin' you can't tell Keep a chain tucked in the truck bed'Cause we're all stuck in our ways We're livin' proof that some things never change Like country songs and honky tonks Red, white, and blue and Jesus saves Thank God that some things never change The S EC or A CC How high you cut them cut off jeans How good your truck is at pickin' up them F M waves Oh, but as for us out in the sticks You can't teach an old bird dog new tricks It's okay that some things never change We still light one up, we still raise some hell We still show up drunk to somethin' thinkin' you can't tell Keep a chain tucked in the truck bed'Cause we're all stuck in our ways We're livin' proof that some things never change Like country songs and honky tonks Red, white, and blue and Jesus saves Thank God that some things never change, yeahSee the sun coming up from the front seat of a Greyhound bus Felt the rain on the faces I was standing at the gates of Graceland Searching for something, searching for someone Lost on the highway a little dazed and confused But the haze of the road dust comes into focus Every time I look at you You're a little white church on a corner in Mississippi The front porch light that feels like home, girl Look at you shine, lovin' you is like findin'A diamond in a rhinestone world You're a red Corvette on a Carolina two lane Lighter in the air to a damn good song, girl Can't believe you're mine lovin' you is like findin'A diamond in a rhinestone world Oh-oh, you're a diamond in a rhinestone world Waking up all alone Means you might have just been chasing ghosts And all the glitter fades fast And a gold rush ain't made to last You're a little white church on a corner in Mississippi The front porch light that feels like home, girl Look at you shine, lovin' you is like findin'A diamond in a rhinestone world You're a red Corvette on a Carolina two lane Lighter in the air to a damn good song, girl Can't believe you're mine lovin' you is like findin'A diamond in a rhinestone world Oh-oh, you're a diamond in a rhinestone worldShe's looking Friday night ready Tearing up in interstate twenty Got the tank topped off Dust flying like confetti in the rear view Got a clear view of these getaway tracks You've got the seat kicked back Radio bumping that classic You looking at me, looking at you Surfing that hand with the power lines Yeah in no time we're nowhere fast We're just wasting gas, blurring them dotted lines Killing all kinds of time, baby, like we ain't coming back Steal a kiss, maybe two, pull it off for a few Gonna hang as long as I can, you know I don't give a damn If we're just wasting gas Every once in a while it'll backfire like a gun I see that needle creeping down like a setting sun You're making every little memory one of a kind You and I riding high all nightThank God, I needed that one more whiskey And somebody bumped you right up against me And you spilled your drink on my favorite shirt Had nothing to lose so I dropped that line That never works But it worked on you One drink ago I was playing it cool You were here with friends, I was shooting pool Now it's crazy how a "Hey what you having "Turned into a "How'd this happen "Now the whole night's spinning like an empty bottle With who knows what else left to follow It's 3 am, just the two of us Standing here, wondering how we'll ever live without What we didn't know One drink ago I swear I never saw you coming Never thought I'd fall like this from me stumbling Into your glass, into your arms Now we're under the stars, leaning on the car In the parking lot, boy look what you started One drink ago I was playing it cool You were here with friends, I was shooting pool Now it's crazy how a "Hey what you having "Turned into a "How'd this happen "Now the whole night's spinning like an empty bottle With who knows what else left to follow It's 3 am, just the two of us Standing here, wondering how we'll ever live without What we didn't know One drink agoSome things aren't built to last They burn out, run out of gas, yeah Most things come and go Outta style, they lose their glow But best things you've gotta keep Sweet as honey, meant to be Picture perfect, put together And only getting better Just like a red wine, apple pie Rolex, suit and tie Grandaddy's Caddy shined up Sitting in the drive Mayberry, fishing pole John Denver, country road You know it once you find it No other word describes it Girl your love is timeless Oh so timeless You help me figure out Just what my mama told me about yeah When the right one comes along She'll hit you like a classic song She'll dance around up in your head You'll hang on every word she said And fifty years down the road She'll still be good as goldHey beautiful, what's your name I know you like it when I play that game Just like I like it when you take my hat And pretend like you ain't gonna give it back You got my mind all over you Got me feelin' sixteen, kinda green, I wanna make a move I've driven down this road a time or two But every curve around you feels brand new I'll be your rebel, kinda reckless Drive your heart wild Do damn near anything just to see you smile Your little out of control, your wanna hold your hand Gonna chase you like a boy and love you like a man Chase you like a boy, love you like a man I know I act like a tough guy But girl you can kiss that goodbye You keep me high school crushin', tryin to play it cool Yeah this love is growin' up but I'm still fallin for you I'll be your rebel, kinda reckless Drive your heart wild Do damn near anything just to see you smile Your little out of control, your wanna hold your hand Gonna chase you like a boy and love you like a man Chase you like a boy, love you like a manPretty little girls flirting with the boys Down at the snowcone stand Beer caps, flip flops, tank tops Popping off down below the dam Souped up pick ups Chrome shiny Harley's Inner tubes, Mountain dew And a fifth of Bacardi Get on your mark set Baby get your feet wet Dive in head first Let it take you under Grab a little sunshine Coppertone tan lines Hanging out talking 'bout Nothing but Summer Summer Little party on a pontoon boat Everybody's here, everybody's getting loud Damn fine tan lines and them Carolina cuties Laid out on the bowIn a cloud of dust, I picked you up off your front porch My old truck was lifted That summer dress messing with my head Caught the wind just a little bit and lifted And it sure felt good You were holding my hand Looking out over that hood Singing John Mellencamp And we were high on nothing but living and loving Running down something called a dirt road dream Our own little world, one boy, one girl Seventeen and riding that sweet southern breeze Lifted, like a song from a choir Lifted, like a flame from a raging fire Lifted First kiss out under the stars I've kissed before but that ol' bar was lifted New spot, we found my old guitar You're dancing around with your arms lifted And you sang along like you'd never be goneI came across that ticket stub Summertime wasn't long enough Living slow and loving fast We made magic in that grass Buying ten dollar beers So we sipped them slow Pulling out the flask When our cups got low We were living it up in the cheap seats On the blanket, yeah, you and me You were my V IP underneath those stars With the kick drum banging a beat in our hearts Way up high, top of the world that night Hell bent on stealing a kiss between every sip It was more than enough We were living it up in the cheap seats Oh, we were living it up This constant tease like a time machine There you are in those ripped blue jeans Couldn't see the band but we didn't care You were penny lane with your hands in the air Oh, the lights went out The crowd screamed some more We were making out Right through the whole encore
