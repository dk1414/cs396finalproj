made for me and you I said love was made for me and you You know that love was made for me and youI'm not surprised, not everything lasts I've broken my heart so many times, I stopped keeping track Talk myself in, I talk myself out I get all worked up, then I let myself down I tried so very hard not to lose it I came up with a million excuses I thought I'd thought of every possibility And I know some day that itâ€™ll all turn out You'll make me work so we can work to work it out And I promise you, kid, that I'll give so much more than I get I just haven't met you yet I might have to wait, I'll never give up I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck Wherever you are, whenever it's right You'll come out of nowhere and into my life And I know that we can be so amazing And baby, your love is gonna change me And now I can see every possibilityBirds flying high You know how I feel Sun in the sky You know how I feel Breeze driftin' on by You know how I feel It's a new dawn It's a new day It's a new life For me And I'm feeling good I'm feeling good Fish in the sea You know how I feel River running free You know how I feel Blossom on a tree You know how I feel It's a new dawn It's a new day It's a new life For me And I'm feeling goodIt's beginning to look a lot like Christmas Everywhere you go Take a look at the five and ten It's glistening once again With candy canes and silver lanes aglow It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas Toys in every store But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be On your own front door A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots Is the wish of Barney and Ben Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk Is the hope of Janice and Jen And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas Everywhere you go There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;Soon the bells will start And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing Right within your heart It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas Toys in every store But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be On your own front doorAnother summer day has come and gone away In Paris and Rome, but I wanna go home, mmm May be surrounded by a million people, I Still feel all alone I just wanna go home Oh, I miss you, you know And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you Each one a line or two I'm fine, baby, how are you Well, I would send them, but I know that it's just not enough My words were cold and flat And you deserve more than that Another aeroplane, another sunny place I'm lucky, I know, but I wanna go home Mmm, I got to go home Let me go home I'm just too far from where you are I wanna come home And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life It's like I just stepped outside When everything was going right And I know just why you could not come along with me That this was not your dream But you always believed in me Another winter day has come and gone away In either Paris or Rome, and I wanna go home Let me go home And I'm surrounded by a million people, I I still feel alone Oh, let me go home Oh, I miss you, you knowWhen marimba rhythms start to play Dance with me, make me sway Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore Hold me close, sway me more Like a flower bending in the breeze Bend with me, sway with ease When we dance you have a way with me Stay with me, sway with me Other dancers may be on the floor Dear, but my eyes will see only you Only you have that magic technique When we sway I go weak I can hear the sounds of violins Long before it begins Make me thrill as only you know how Sway me smooth, sway me now Other dancers may be on the floor Dear, but my eyes will see only you Only you have that magic technique When we sway I grow weak I can hear the sounds of violins Long before it begins Make me thrill as only you know how Sway me smooth, sway me nowJust because I wander 'round the places we would go Hopin' that I'd run into you one last time Just because I never took your picture off my phone Doesn't mean that you're still on my mind Just because I accidentally slip and say your name When I hear our song, it makes me insecure Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same Doesn't mean I love you anymore Am I lyin' to myself again When I say you're not the best I've ever had Am I lyin' to myself again When I say that I'm not missing you so bad Just because I'm on my knees and swearing I will change And I'd do anything to hear you say, "I'm yours"Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same Doesn't mean I love you anymore Am I lyin' to myself again When I say you're not the best I've ever had Am I lyin' to myself again When I say that I'm not missing you so bad You're a falling star, you're the getaway car You're the line in the sand when I go too far You're the swimming pool on an August day And you're the perfect thing to say And you play it coy, but it's kinda cute Ah, when you smile at me, you know exactly what you do Baby, don't pretend that you don't know it's true'Cause you can see it when I look at you And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times It's you, it's you, you make me sing You're every line, you're every word You're everything You're a carousel, you're a wishing well And you light me up, when you ring my bell You're a mystery, you're from outer space You're every minute of my everyday And I can't believe, uh, that I'm your man And I get to kiss you, baby, just because I can Whatever comes our way, ah, we'll see it through And you know that's what our love can doTime goes by And I've been holding everything inside But now I've got nothing left to hide When I'm with you, oh, you But I can see How strong a man I'm gonna have to be To do for you what comes so naturally It's in the way you move And all I want Is a chance to prove Show all I can do I believe in starting over I can see that your heart is true I believe in good things coming back to you You're the light that lifts me higher So bright, you guide me through I
