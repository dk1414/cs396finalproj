Something in your eyes makes me want to lose myself Makes me want to lose myself in your arms There's something in your voice Makes my heart beat fast Hope this feeling lasts the rest of my life If you knew how lonely my life has been And how long I've been so alone If you knew how I wanted someone to come along And change my life the way you've done It feels like home to me It feels like home to me It feels like I'm all the way back where I come from It feels like home to me It feels like home to me It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong A window breaks down a long dark street And a siren wails in the night But I'm alright cause I have you here with me And I can almost see through the dark there is light If you knew how much this moment means to me And how long I've waited for your touch If you knew how happy you are making me I never thought that I'd love anyone so muchOoh All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go I'm standing here outside your door I hate to wake you up to say goodbye But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn The taxi's waiting, he's blowin' his horn Already I'm so lonesome I could die So kiss me and smile for me Tell me that you'll wait for me Hold me like you'll never let me go Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane Don't know when I'll be back again Oh babe, I hate to go Ooh There's so many times I've let you down So many times I've played around I tell you now, they don't mean a thing Every place I go, I'll think of you Every song I sing, I'll sing for you When I come back I'll wear your wedding ring So kiss me and smile for me Tell me that you'll wait for me Hold me like you'll never let me go Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane Don't know when I'll be back again Oh babe, I hate to goTwinkle twinkle little star How I wonder where you are Up above the sky so high Like a diamond in the night Twinkle twinkle little star How I wonder what you are Up above the world so high Like a diamond in the sky The sky I'm a traveler in the dark And I thank you for your tiny spark I would not see where to go If you did not twinkle Twinkle twinkle little star How I wonder what you are Up above the world so high Like a diamond in the sky The sky The skyI used to carry the weight of the world And now all I wanna do is spread my wings and fly I don't know why I was So afraid all the time Memories seemed To bother me My whole life I used to carry the weight of the world And now all I wanna do is spread my wings and fly I used to carry the weight of the world And now all I wanna do is spread my wings and fly I don't know why I was So ashamed Such a waste of time And I don't know Who I was trying to be All those lies I used to carry the weight of the world And now all I wanna do is spread my wings and fly I used to carry the weight of the world And now all I wanna do is spread my wings and flyYou're gonna be somebody You'll be bigger than Mars They might walk on you now But they'll walk on your star You're gonna take the title like the

moments as they pass Now I've looked in the mirror and the worlds getting clearer So wait for me this time I'm down I'm down on my knees I'm begging for all your sympathy But you,  you don't seem to care You humble people everywhere Now I've looked in the mirror and the world's getting clearer I'll take what you give me Please know that I'm learning So wait for me this time I should've know better And I shouldn't have wasted those days And afternoons and mornings I threw them all away Now This is my time And I'm going to make this moment mineLet me show you what I'm made of Good intentions are not enough To get me through today And this life You're in the basement Watching the T VI'm on the second floor Watching the ceiling We'll sleep underneath the same big sky at night And dream the same dream we can fly You can run from me You can hide from me But I am right beside you In this life Let me tell you who you really are You're my comfort You're not a superstar I can reach up and bring you back down Oh to the ground And give you everything you dream about You can run from me You can hide from me But I am right beside you In this lifeBaby before you Well, I was bad news In letting me love you I think I can get through Oh baby, before you Well, I was so scared I was a train wreck waiting to happen On the way to nowhere And now I think it's kind of funny that you say you love me You tell me that I'm crazy then you smile And now I think I'll get through the end of the world Now I think I'll get through being a girl Now I think I'll get through anything Now I think I'll get through Now honey around you I'm feeling so good'Cause you picked me up out of the rough And you polished me up and made me brand newO holy night, the stars are brightly shining It is the night of my dear saviorâ€™s birth!Long lay the world in sin and error pining Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices!O night divine, oh night when Christ was born!O night divine, oh night, oh night divine!Truly he taught us to love one another His law is love and his gospel is peace Chains shall he break for the slave is our brother And in his name all oppression shall cease Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we Let all within us praise his holy name Christ is the king  That ever, ever praise we!His power and glory evermore proclaim His power and glory evermore proclaimSomething in your eyes makes me want to lose myself Makes me want to lose myself in your arms There's something in your voice Makes my heart beat fast Hope this feeling lasts the rest of my life If you knew how lonely my life has been And how long I've been so alone If you knew how I wanted someone to come along And change my life the way you've done It feels like home to me It feels like home to me It feels like I'm all the way back where I come from It feels like home to me It feels like home to me It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong A window breaks down a long dark street And a siren wails in the night But I'm alright cause I have you here with me And I can almost see through the dark there is light If you knew how much this moment means to me And how long I've waited for your touch If you knew how happy you are making me I never thought that I'd love anyone so much
