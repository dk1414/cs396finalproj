did the shit that they wanted Cause I’m sick of livin’ on my knees and feeling bad for myself And tryna drink away the pain and always trading my health Cuz tryna find a way to cope is part of being a man I just resolved to buckle down and spit it real as I can Cuz in the day I work a job and when I get out it’s night But if I get some recognition, I could get on a flight And get the fuck from where I’m from, and this dead-end shit Feel the challenges approaching, tryna test this grip Fuck, waiting cuz I gotta go get it while I’m a kid Won’t get older still regretting the shit that I never did See the lane filled with nobody as ill as myself And tryna live the life of normal shit I’m killin myself And all I got is myself, so now I’m stopping that shit Got to remember when I said it’s not an option to quit Got to remember where I’ve been just to know where I’m going I gotta preach it from the rebels bible bucking and flowing Now muthafucka what it do, I’m like who the fuck is you
