And I will go sailing no more All the things I thought I'd be All the brave things I'd done Vanished like a snowflake With the rising of the sun Nevermore to sail my ship Where no man has gone before And I will go sailing no more But, no  -It can't be true!I could fly if I wanted to!Like a bird in the sky If I believed I could fly Well, I'd fly I was on top of the world livin' high It was right in my pocket I was livin' the life Things were just the way they should be When from out of the sky like a bomb comes some little punk in a rocket Now all of a sudden some strange things are happenin' to me I had friends I had lots of friends Now all my friends are gone And I'm doin' the best I can to carry on I had power I was respected But not any more And I've lost the love of the one whom I adore Let me tell you about the strange things are happenin' to me Strange things Strange things are happenin' to me...Ain't no doubt about it You got someone you think you know well Who turns out a stranger The minute you turn your back You're in it all by yourself They laugh at your jokes You think you're doin' quite well But you're in danger, boy You end up alone, forgotten, way up on the shelfYou're still the same girl you always were Still the same girl you always were A few more nights on the street; that's all A few more holes in your arm A few more years with me; that's all Still the same girl The same sweet smile that you always had The same blue eyes like the sun The same clear voice that I always knew Still the same girl That I loveWelcome, welcome, welcome to this great
