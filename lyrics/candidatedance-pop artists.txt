know better but you know I know, I know I ain't ever gonna changeHere's my confession I've got a death wish I'm in the fast lane Addicted to excess Living my best life I was on top right Sipping the limelight A deer in the headlights My future used to shine as bright as a diamond Where did time go I was so high, it was frightening I know I messed up, but there's no use in crying Oh, my dear Lord I've been running wild, had a good time But I can't stop now Over my head in a landslide Can you pull me out Oh, my dear Lord Oh, my dear Lord Oh, my dear LordYou know I gotta love you Our name is written in the streets You are a force of nature The fire's moving through your feet Oh, your love Your love could start a war Your love Is what I'm fighting for I would die for this revelation Oh, your love Your love could start a Your love could start a war The dawn will break before you Under your thumb I'm on my knees You play a game of pressure You're getting stronger while I sleep You're burning up the sky you're a constellation Swear that I could die in this revelationI keep my heart Under the floorboards Deep in the dark Far away from yours A panic starts in a little box When you're at my door And it's fine, no, I lied, I feel it screaming It knows what you've come for Heart What is it I hear I'm moving towards the fear And it wants to feel you call my name Heart What is it I feel I'm moving past the real And it wants to hear you call my name You call my nameMaybe I should leave her Maybe I don't need her Maybe I was wrong, maybe she was right Maybe I believe her What do I have to say What do I have to do She don't know either She says, "I'ma show you how to act"Mama don't talk like that She gonna hit me with a baseball bat, yeah And all her lovers say She breaks the silence, here comes the sirens Bang, bang, bang, I'm just running from the violence Echoes divide and she shows no kindness Bang, bang, bang, I'm just running from the violence Running from the violence Running from the violence Running from the violenceEverybody's crazy for pretending they're not Used to be as kids, but I guess we forgot How many years does it take to unlearn Life's just a game and it's just your turn I look out the window at my old trampoline Forgotten and rusted like all of my dreams Maybe the best thing that I can do Is begin again and start things anew So I'll beat the drum and scream at the sun Trampoline, up, up, up, down Begin again and find a new end Trampoline, up, up, up, down Trampoline She led me by the hand to the trampoline My muse walked me through my dizzy drunken dream Young lovers making heat on a summer night Her lily skin burning naked and bright We confessed to each other that we felt the same She pulled me in close and softly breathed my name Wish I could stare again into those eager honest eyes That now in my mind glare at me with despiseShe's a ringer Put a ring, put a ring, put a ring around her finger Put a ring, put a ring, put a ring It's a lady, got a lot of ambition Shady's my intuition Says she's a doctor 'cause she's got the bills She's just a ringer who lives in the hills So crazy, don't know if I can trust her Lately, she's talking like a hustler She could be the American dream I'd do anything for her to marry me She's worth her weight in gold But one thing I know She's a ringer Put a ring, put a ring, put a ring around her finger Gotta know, gotta know, gotta know She's a ringer Put a ring, put a ring, put a ring around her finger Gotta know, gotta know, gotta knowNovocaine I keep it coming so I feel no pain
