One One, two, one, two, three, four They met in a hurricane Standing in the shelter out of the rain She tucked a note into his hand Later on, they took his car Drove on down where the beaches are He wrote her name in the sand Never even let go of her hand Somehow they stayed that way For those five days in May Made all the stars around them shine Funny how you can look in vain Livin' on nerves and such sweet pain A loneliness that cuts so fine Find the face you've seen a thousand times Sometimes the world begins To set you up on your feet again And I know it wipes the tears from your eyes How will you ever know The way that circumstances go Always gonna hit you by surprise But I know my past You were there In everything I've done You are the oneYou say that you're leaving Well, that comes as no surprise Still, I kinda like this feeling Of being left behind This ain't nothing new to me Well, it's just like going home It's kinda like those sunsets That leave you feeling so stoned Hey, hey, I guess it hasn't hit me yet I fell through this crack and I kinda lost my head I stand transfixed before this streetlight Watching the snow fall on this cold December night Never thought this could happen But somehow the feeling's gone You got sick of the pattern And I got lost in this song Hey, hey, I guess it hasn't hit me yet I fell through this crack and I kinda lost my head I stand transfixed before this streetlight Watching the snow fall on this cold December nightStrange and beautiful are the stars tonight That dance around your head In your eyes, I see that perfect world I hope that doesn't sound too weird And I want all the world to know That your love's all I need All that I need And if we're lost Then we are lost together Yeah, if we're lost We are lost together I stand before this faceless crowd And I wonder why I bother So much controlled by so few Stumbling from one disaster to another I've heard it all so many times before It's all a dream to me now A dream to me nowHey, it's me what a big surprise Calling you up from a restaurant 'round the bend Just got in from way up North I'm achin' tired now, and I could use a friend I might be a fool To think that you do Wanna see me again I know it's been a while since I talked to you Nothing wrong, just nothing ever goes as planned Many times I thought I'd call I didn't have your number in my hand I know it's true That you'd never do The same thing to me I never meant to make you cry And though I know I shouldn't call It just reminds us of the cost Oh, of everything we've lost Bad timing that's all And maybe soon there'll come a day When no more tears will fall We each forgive a little bit And we both look back on it As just bad timing that's allDon't tell me I'm wrong'Cause I've been watching every move that you make Hearts you steal, in your makeup and heels Trouble for the men that you take Every time you walk in the room I couldn't ever be sure of a smile You were never the same way twice I'm falling in love Oh, night after night Oh, it's crazy, ooh So many people who said, ooh Girl, you've got nothing but time Oh, you are a shining star Don't worry what youâ€™re leaving behind Every time you walk in the room I couldn't ever be sure of a smile You were never the same way twice I'm falling in love Oh, night after night Oh, it's crazyI want to know where my confidence went One day it all disappeared And I'm lying in a hotel room miles away Voices next door in my ear Well, daytime's a drag, nighttime's worse Hope that I can get home soon But the half-finished bottles of inspiration Lie like ghosts in my room Well, I wanna go I know I can't stay But I don't want to run feeling this way'Til I am myself'Til I am myself'Til I am myself again There's a seat on the corner I keep every night Wait 'til the evening begins I feel like a stranger from another world But at least I'm living again There are nights full of anger Words that are thrown Tempers that are shattered and thin But the moments of magic are just too short They're over before they beginSun breaks I can't wait'Til I'll be on my way again I'm sick and tired of waiting With nothing to do Watching the rain through a crack in the window It's the little things that get you through Like the same sun rising on me Is rising over you Walking and talking Like birds in the sky You tell your secrets How gracefully you lie That's the way you come to me I'm head over heels And I'm always gonna be That's okay, I love the way you come to me I guess we're tempting fate A little too long it seems Walking this heat Is just like floating in a dream I've been torn apart put back together With a couple of pieces in wrong I'm holding up now But I won't be for longI hear you talking everywhere Words on the loudspeakers Hanging in the air Everywhere And I remember the words You told me too This town's full of losers Trying to get a piece of you You really think that's true How long will it take'Til you open up your eyes I've been gone for years You never even realised How long How long In a corner of the world on election day You watched your star shatter Then fade away Too many wasted days With your eyes wide open a hand on the wheel You looked back hard trying to Remember just how it feels How does it feelI met this girl, she was walking through one of my dreams She kissed my eyes And everything that she said made so much sense to me That I still feel like I'm half asleep My dark angel, she gave me diamonds for eyes She walked by, ow I'm hypnotised By this dream that just won't stop And I feel like I've always been lost in this dream The rumours of heaven only speak the truth on earth My dark angel, shine your light on my curse You are the other that I have to find Until I do, I guess I'll see you 'round my mind So Colorado is a place I have to go I heard a rumour she loves the mountains and the snow My dark angel, she gave me diamonds for eyes My dark angel, I offer you my heart My dark angel, I think I loved you from the startWhat is this love that I leave behind How can I turn from the tears in your eyes What is this world where we always pretend That it is worth it, worth it in the end What is this life we share that I just throw away Is this love that causes so much pain What is the promise that I leave behind Why can't I just lie beside you again What's goin' on How'd it get so wrong What's goin' on How'd it get so wrong What is this dream that I'll never find What is this prayer that's stealing my mind What is this deal that I've just made with fate And I wonder if I have left it too late
