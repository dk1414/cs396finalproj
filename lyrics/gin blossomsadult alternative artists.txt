Well, tell me, do you think it'd be all right If I could just crash here tonight You can see I'm in no shape for driving And anyway, I've got no place to go And you know, it might not be that bad You were the best I'd ever had If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago I might not be alone Tomorrow we can drive around this town And let the cops chase us around The past is gone, but something might be found To take its place Hey jealousy Hey jealousy Hey jealousy Hey jealousy You can trust me not to think And not to sleep around And if you don't expect too much from me You might not be let down'Cause all I really want is to be with you Feeling like I matter too If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago I might be here with youAll last summer in case you don't recall I was yours and you were mine; forget it all Is there a line that I could write That's sad enough to make you cry And all the lines you wrote to me were lies Months roll past, the love that you struck dead Did you love me only in my head There were things you said and did to me They seem to come so easily The love I thought I'd won, you give for free Whispers at the bus stop Well, I've heard about nights out in the schoolyard I found out about you I found out about you Rumors follow everywhere you go Like when you left and I was last to know Well, you're famous now and there's no doubt In all the places you hang out They know your name and they know what you're about Whispers at the bus stop Well, I've heard about nights out in the schoolyard I found out about you I found out about youDid you see the sky  I think it means that we've been lost Maybe one less time is all we need I can't really help it if my tongue's all tied in knots Jumping off a bridge, it's just the farthest that I've ever been Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down Anyplace but those I know by heart Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down I'll follow you down, but not that far I know we're headed somewhere, I can see how far we've come Still, I can't remember anything Let's not do the wrong thing and I'll swear it might be fun It's a long way down when all the knots we've tied have come undone Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down Anyplace but those I know by heart Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down I'll follow you down, but not that far How you gonna ever find your place Running in an artificial pace Are they gonna find us lying face-down in the sand So what the hell now  We've already been forever damnedI want to tell if I am or I am not myself It's hard to know how far or if at all could go I've waited far too long for something I forgot was wrong I don't know all the answers I think that I'll find Or have it within the time, but it's all that I'll have in mind Until I fall away I won't keep you waiting long Until I fall away I don't know what to do anymore Until I fall away My fear pretend that I'll never be in love again It's real to me, but not like these fools and not like this scene I won't find or have it within the time If it's all rusted and faded in the spot where we fell Where I thought I'd left behind, it's loose now, but we could try Until I fall away I won't keep you waiting long Until I fall away I don't know what to do anymore Until I fall away I didn't ask, they shouldn't have told me At first, I laughed, but now It's sinking in fast whatever they've sold me Well, baby I don't wanna take advice from fools I'll just figure everything is cool Until I hear it from you It gets hard, the memory's faded Who gets what they say It's likely they're just jealous and jaded Well, maybe I don't wanna take advice from fools I'll just figure everything is cool Until I hear it from you Until I hear it from you I can't let it get me off Or break up my train of thought As far as I know, nothing's wrong Until I hear it from youI've lost my mind On what I'd find And all of the pressure that I left behind On Allison Road Fools in the rain And if the sun gets through Fires in the heaven of the eyes I knew On Allison Road Well, dark clouds fall in when the moon was near Birds fly by a.m  in her bedroom stare There was no telling what I might find And I couldn't see I was lost at the time On Allison Road Yeah, I didn't know I was lost at the time On Allison Road So she fills up her sails With my wasted breath And each one's more wasted than the others, you can bet On Allison Road Now I can't hide So why not drive  I know I wanna love her, but I can't decide On Allison RoadWell, is it any wonder that the stars just don't rush by When you're only doin' 60 through this oh-so-vacant night But it's lacking something big this time What the hell did you expect to find Aphrodite on a barstool by your side Twelfth night we go After something everyone should know Somewhere in the distance, out of sight Then I saw gin mill, rainfall What do you remember, if at all Only pieces of the night And is it any wonder in the middle of the crowd If you let your feet get trampled on When the music is that loud But you wanted to be where you are But it looked much better from afar A hillside in shadow Between the people and the stars Twelfth night we go After something everyone should know Somewhere in the distance, out of sight Then I saw gin mill, rainfall What do you remember, if at all Only pieces of the nightHow can I find us something that two can take Without stumbling as we walk into our future's wake I'm like a broken record that you can play Repeating, as if it matters, everything I wanna say I'll be alright as long as it matters As long as you're here with me now Forget that time, it's nothing we touch and see All this is fine, even as it crashes down on me I'm looking around, there's nothing that I could want More than to tell you there's no more than we've already got I'll be alright as long as it matters As long as you're here with me now I'll be alright as long as it matters As long as you're here with me now Forget that our time is almost up I'll be alright as long as it matters As long as you're here with me now I'll be alright as long as it matters As long as you're here with me nowThe last horizons I can see Are filled with bars and factories And in them all, we fight to stay awake I'll drink enough of anything To make this world look new again I'm drunk, drunk, drunk in the gardens and the graves She had nothing left to say So she said she loved me And I stood there grateful for the lie I'll drink enough of anything To make this girl look new again I'm drunk, drunk, drunk in the gardens and the graves Turn summer trees to bones and ice Turn insect songs against the night With words we build and words we break I'm drunk, drunk, drunk in the gardens and the graves Maybe I could use you to reassure myself I wouldn't wish this indecision on anybody else I'll drink enough of anything to make this world look new again And when the sin smiles, how could it be wrong
