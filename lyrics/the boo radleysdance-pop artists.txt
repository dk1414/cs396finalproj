Wake up, it's a beautiful morning Wake up, it's a beautiful morning Wake up, it's a beautiful morning Wake up, it's a beautiful morning Wake up, it's a beautiful morning Wake up, it's a beautiful morning Wake up, it's a beautiful morning Wake up, it's a beaut-Summer's gone Days spent with the grass and sun I don't mind To pretend I do seems really dumb I rise as the morning comes Crawling through the blinds I shouldn't be up at this time But I can't sleep with you there by my side Wake up, it's a beautiful morning Feel the sun shining for your eyes Wake up, it's so beautiful For what could be the very last timeI must be losing my mind I keep on trying to find a way out But it's ok you don't lock the door anymore I, you know I never go out And you know that I start to forget things But it's ok they weren't essential anyway I, and when I start to look back I feel like I've spent my whole life just kicking round And not getting in the way And now, and maybe now I should change Because I'm starting to lose all my faith While those around me are beaten down each dayWishin' I was skinny Wishin' that the whole world knew my name Wishin' I was thrillin'That I would never be to blame Wishin' I was kissin'A girl with lips smooth as pearl Wishin' I was pretty Wish that I could wrap the world round my finger Wishin' I had money Wishin' for the time to spend it all Wishin' I was pretty Wish that I could twist the world round my finger But I would always love you I guess that would never changeNow it's getting colder My hands chilled to the bone I watch you breath and trace It's steps as it mingles with my Own  The lake is almost frozen The grass is silver air The wind is high in the blue sky I wish that I could care I recall when we were younger We shared the streets of home Spoke of our dreams and soaring Schemes and places we would Go, if I stay much longer I'll never leave again, I have to Move I cannot stay, believe the Voice that tells me leave it all Behind me, I know that I know That I am wrong, I'll never leave Now it has been so long And now I'm getting older, I still Can't find the words to empathise With what's inside, express the way I feel and now I'm getting older It's easier to hide, to run away Day after day betray the voice that tells me leave it all behind me, I Know that I know that I am wrong, I'll Never leave now it has been so longBarney and me You know we lived out our dreams Outside the newsagents closed for the night We dreamt of being kings Okay, we did the same things But never the same way twice The picture's faded, I'm still the same It's the picture that keeps me sane Ooh, it stops the lonely thinking Of the time when we were the only Ooh it stops my mind from going round Round, round, round and round it goes Not much to say, you've headed out On Kingsway while I took the avenue down Tomorrow would be the same Somehow, I feel it's a shame That we won't be there tonight Reflected in the pane Sitting through the rain And the dark, barely seventeen Feeling like we've been here so longAin't that just you You know the facts, but you Haven't got a clue About me or my life, why don't You try and take the time Till then what am I supposed To do  but then that's just Like you to leave me I hang suspended on your Words, yeah you leave me I hang suspended on your words Don't you care  I don't read Minds and I did I'd be Elsewhere, tell me what's on Your mind so I can rectify in Time, or else I won't know What I'm to do, but then that's Just like you to leave me I hang suspended on your wordsCroce Jim The Faces I've Been The Edges Of Your Day Where there is a dream there is a hope for you Where there is a love there is a way Coming from the edges of the night to you Coming from the edges of your day Waiting in all your towers, keeping all my flowers If you need me come close now and receive me While there is a moment there is a time for you Even though your time is far away Deep within the night I send my love to you Reaching for the edges of your day Spending all my hours, dreaming of your towers If you need me come close now and receive meI don't need you preachin'Tellin' me points of law I got my own problems Trying to stay off the floor As the vultures circle And the bills and demands fill the floor It's been three weeks and three days Since I last stepped out my door This is my life too This is mine Jesus this room's so cold But you've got your own problems I can't see an end to it allNew Brighton Promenade What am I trying to say You were just on my mind Do you remember me This life is not easy The one thing that can please me The memory of me and my friends Kicking round your shore New Brighton Promenade It's 1983 For ever on the place Where the baths used to be And time has passed quickly The years have been kind to me The memories go with my friends Will always be around You still exist inside my head There's no such thing as being dead When somebody keeps your ghost inside And if you looked inside my head you wouldn't Find a mind instead Step into New Brighton PromenadeGotta get out of these smoky clothes Rid myself of this canon of filth Drinkin’ at the mixer with mark and key All my friends are there with me Ashton plays guitar with a rock and roll band Catelina works at the mtv Sarah likes eggs and digs our sound Andy lives free but he’s home for tea Stayin’ at pete’s With the reverend went Bakers at the studio wait for me Chords and s-x and dogs and kids All don’t mean that much today You’ll never touch the magic if you don’t reach out far enough You’ll never touch the magic if you don’t reach out far enough You’ll never touch the magic if you don’t reach out far enough
