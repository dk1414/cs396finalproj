When he died he went to where The saints of God did stay In the holding place They lived beyond the tomb And there he saw Elijah, Moses, Samuel, even Ruth And all the others jammed up in a room He turned around and saw Ol' Gideon standin' by the door He walked up and said hey brother What's this group here for Well Giddie said Well alright this is testimony night Have a seat man cause The
