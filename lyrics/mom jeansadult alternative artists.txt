I think it's 'bout time That I warned you, I might cry in front of you And I don't want you to feel Like I'm afraid of the truth I didn't want you to feel Like it was all your fault But that doesn't mean That I wanted you to feel nothing at all What do you want me to say When I can't tell you the truth But tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to deal with losing you So what's the point of talking If you're not changing your mind It just reminds me of the lying And it's wasting my time So was it worth it to me To wait around and then see If all my love was well-spent My nighttime hikes and weekends You are my best friend And I don't want this to endIt's hard for me to see exactly Where the hell I went wrong I never thought I'd see the day We wouldn't get along You think I smoke too much I think your friends all suck Can't figure out the reason why our parents fight so much But I've given up on luck But I'm happy here I'm happy here So leave my sweater on the porch I'll leave your bag under the stairs Don't go back to our old place It's probably locked up anyway I bet it still looks the same as when I ran away that day It doesn't matter anyway'Cause I'm Happy here, yes, I'm Happy here, I'm Happy here, I'm Happy here I sleep well alone now I sleep well alone now I sleep well alone now I sleep well alone now I sleep well alone now I sleep well alone now I sleep well alone now I sleep well alone now]Sorry, it's just, people are complaining You know, they want to know if you guys can maybe try tuning up again  Or- ...play on beat and just do it right   All right Let's stop foolin' around and turn this band into a lean, mean, mom jeans revenge machine Mom Jeans What do you want me to say It's never going away'Cause I'm stuck on you like the smell Of cigarettes on your flower dress I want you under my fingernails I want you in my sleep and in my dreams I wake up spooning my pillow Sweaty hands, but please don't tell your friends Now I'm addicted to cigarettes At first I didn't let myself inhale But smoke got through and so did you And now every burn hole smells like home And I know it's killing me But that still won't stop me'Cause now we smell the same But you still kill me fasterBaby, I'm sorry Things didn't work out the way that I planned But we both know that planning's not my strong suit I'm sad that I lost you, but I won't chase you I still don't blame you for making me stall When I learned how to drive your car Because your best friends were all too sad to take you to the airport But I miss you every minute of every day Tell me, why can't you still make a decision 'Cause I'm getting better at Crying without making any noise All I want is your voice in my head And your hair in my bed Please tell me why I'm so afraid of dying alone So scared and so stoned But I don't know what I need, so just tell me what you need You're all I need Just please don't make meIs it so much to ask that you text me back I'm so scared of losing touch, I'm forced to ask if you know that The reason why I try so hard to be nice Is so no one else will leave me behind You're right that it's not that hard to tell the ones that you love How much they mean and how you'd feel if it was them and not us But I can't make the time in my life to be sad every time you're around me Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum How did it make you feel to know you're not quite enough For someone who took so much from you and then just gave up On the things that used to make me so glad, I was the one holding your hand'Cause I'm not too busy, I'm just still dizzy trying to Catch my fucking breath through these sweat-soaked sheets But you're still so pretty and I'm still too skinny to hold All this weight on my own Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum Bum, ba-dum, ba-dum Bum, ba-dum, ba-dumWhy you gotta be so fuckin' mean Said it's not your scene Could you just leave me Alone with my friends Alone with my thoughts But I often have thoughts that can't be shared and If you really cared about my health About my heart Then you would start Keeping track of all the times You said that you were fine but really weren't It's just like back in time when you were five The doctor said you would be fine but It still hurt and I'm still sure It was just a little trick to make us feel all right Now I smell like smoke And I feel like shit Probably couldn't hurt if we took a dip Then I'll finally be as clean as I felt back at eighteen'Cause I'm not getting any younger My lungs get blacker every day If I were to grow a beard, stop drinking beer I fear you might not love me enough to make you stay I really hope you'll stayI want to be like Drake and Rihanna Sitting courtside at your favorite basketball games, holding hands Eating six-dollar popcorn and yelling at some fucking guy front of me in the stands'Cause he's too tall and I can't see And I'm scared 'cause he's way bigger than me Well, you hate my hair and you hate my pants Can't understand why I stay up late getting drunk with my friends'Cause it makes me feel like I'm still fun Makes me feel like you're not gone But your room is empty now And your bed is just a couch And I just wish that you could get my emails I wish I could just call you up And tell you that I miss you But I'm doing fine, are you alright And I, I know it sounds insane, but You're stuck inside my brain And all I want is to return To the safety and comfort of your bed I like to think that I know some things about myself But I can't help feeling like a huge douche when I'm around you Fuck all your friends and their stupid conversations about how it isn't fair to be us To be young and dumb and sad and scared And tired and hungry and undervalued and overwhelmed When all I want to do is smoke some weed and stay in bedI know it's not exactly what you're looking for But that doesn't mean that you can disregard All of the things that you told me before I think back to all the times I kissed your hands And how I can't stand the touch of any other hands You tell me I should quit, well, I think you should sit Right there and think about how your words make me feel Take me back to water breaks and burning insides Way back when we got high for the very first time I try so hard not to show how much I like this'Cause I feel happy again So take me back I'll wait I know it seems like I'm wasting my time away On things that still don't matter I don't care who can shotgun faster But when the goat runs dry, what's left behind Is someone I don't mind I'm dying withI'm getting kind of tired of All the empty picture frames Still feels like I'm not quite moved in yet I'm getting kind of tired of Facing all my fears At one time It's hard to believe that I'll be fine one day I don't get too far before I waver off Take as much as I can before I get caught I'm getting so tired of Coughing out my lungs And sticking out my tongue To catch the breath you stole the day you Told me this was love And healed me with your hugs And made me feel this might just not be doomed to fail so hard I don't get too far before I waver off Take as much as I can before I get caught I'm not scared of dying I'm just overwhelmed I love you more than I've ever loved myself I don't expect anything Can't get my hopes up too far Don't text me just to pick up Call just to cut me off I'm not scared of dying I'm just overwhelmed I love you more than I've ever loved MyselfI'm getting so tired of the inside of my bedroom Force myself to go outside and get some light Wear a T-shirt that's not black Get myself into the shower, stay inside there for an hour Barely get back home on time, I'm just fine I'm always double-parked, my car won't start, you ripped my heart out And it's hurting so bad But that's all right, I'll be fine if this bleeding won't subside'Cause it keeps me warm'Cause it's so hard To change your clothes Every morning So lend me your ears I'll keep you safe As long as you let me'Cause I'm so Sad Whenever you're not Here
