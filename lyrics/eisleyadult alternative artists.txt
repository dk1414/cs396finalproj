The winner takes all It's the thrill of one more kill The last one to fall Will never sacrifice their will Don't ever look back on the world closing in Be on the attack with your wings on the wind Oh, the games will begin And it's sweet, sweet, sweet victory..  yeah It's ours for the taking It's ours for the fight And it's sweet, sweet, sweet victory..  yeah And the one who's last to fall The winner takes all You don't win no silver You only lose the gold You push with a fever For your time keeps tolling on Against all the odds, against all your pain Your back's on the wall with no one to blame Wild hearts won't be tamedHoney Baby Sleep tight, sleep tight Baby Precious Those bugs won't bite'Cause I'm louder than a lion My hands wipe out the ghosts I'm brighter than a diamond My light will shine the most Oh We fall Backwards Faster than the speed of sound If you want to fly, we're able If you want to flee, I'm stable I'll stand and fight when you're wrong We can stay in the moment Don't hold your breath too long Try my best not to hurt you I won't squeeze your hand too tightI need an ambulance I took, I took the worst of the blow Send me a redeemer Let me know if I'm gonna be alright Am I gonna be alright 'Cause I know how it usually goes I know how it usually goes I built a monument For the love we used to know But that is far removed And you say that I'm gonna be okay And yeah, I'm gonna be okay But it doesn't seem that way No love, not today'Cause I was told to get out, told to leave Told I have my things in the parking lot No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, baby, yeah Just send me that ambulance, oh Just send me that ambulance Ooh woah, oh, oh, oh, no, oh, oh Ooh woah, oh, oh, oh, no, ohI may have faltered in my life But not with you, I couldn't make this up I've had trouble disengaging my heart But I'll bite the grenade pin out You know I want you, you know I will fight Down in the trenches, holding your hand tight I will not make it out without with you I'll bite the bullet, I'll fall right through you Sweet, sweet baby of mine You will be the one I call on for all time Your weird mind, your bright eyes I've wasted so much time On all the things that don't turn me on So let's fight on You know I want you, you know I will fight Down in the trenches, holding your hand tight I will not make it out without with you I'll bite the bullet, I'll fall right through youThere I sat alone in the car The weight of what you'd done all around me Oh, all around me And with the water rushing down my eyes It was all that I could do not to scream But oh, it's alright, now that it's over, oh baby This was the night And oh mr  moon shines down on my home It's where I belong without you Recall, I want a recall You are crying on my telephone But oh no, oh no Bones crack and fingers blister I might console you, but look at my sisters Brilliant like fireflies up in their bedroom But oh, mr  moon shines down on my home It's where I belong without you And oh, what can be said for the gift that has Flown into my hand, in my hand There I sat alone in the car The weight of what you'd done all around meYou’re behind the door I’m on the floor I’m feelin' so shy You’re brushing out your hair I hope you know I care I'm feelin' so high I feel so sorry Oh, I feel so sick I’ve been tryin' to meet you But I wasn’t in the right place And I'm carving your name in the tree where I sit and pray about all of the things I've done How I wasn't there with you always But I wasn't in the right place I made a big mistake You’re not a mistake How I can I explain this But you’ve got my eyes Baby, I’m on your side You’re still my babyWhisper my name I will find you, I will fly In my mind I feel you inside As I slide over the sky I will find you, oh and I And I know I’d only let you down And I know you won’t stick around But I'll make sure I'll keep you coming to my door Dust from your hair Small splinter from your back Keep my raging mind in check My sweet heart, each curse, every crime Your thoughts, your thoughts Are mine mine mine mine mine And I know I’d only let you down And I know you won’t stick around But I'll make sure, I'll keep you coming back And the taste of wine is oh so sweet And I'm going to sweep you off your feet Just take my hand, just take my small, sweet handHardly waiting 'til the bed was warm You closed your eyes and said, "I'm feeling torn"How could I be so unendingly forced into this course Sad, I feel sad For you, so sad You'll be left alone, and broken bleeding From the heart, when he doesn't come home Softly sighs my Nightingale Another broken promise tips the scale and it goes pale He sings shifting from side to side Can't make up his god-given mind, no Why don't you just go If she's waiting Sad, I feel sad For you, so sad You'll be left alone, and broken bleeding From the heart, when he doesn't come home Whoa, oh honey, I am telling you, you better think about it Oh, ohIf I had one wish It'd be for you, and all your friends that didn't like me And if I had one wish It'd be that we had danced more at that apocryphal wedding If I sound angry, I'm sorry This body can only cry for so long And if you want to blame me, then go on I'm smiling now cause I'm smarter than you think I'm smarter than you I'm smarter than you think I apologize for not telling you that my halo was cut from paper Sliced from the fibers that made up all the parts that we were together And even though I miss you, I'm thankful It's obvious that this war was futile So put your hands together and clap for the painful choice you've made cause it's right I'm smarter than you I'm smarter than you think I'm smarter than you I'm smarter than you think You are the narcissist You're everything you saw in meI awoke the dawn Saw horses growing out the lawn Ah...Ah...I glimpsed a bat with butterfly wings Oh, what marvelous things Ah...Ah...Dark night, hold tight And sleep tight my baby Morning light shall burst bright And keep us here safely I followed a rabbit Through rows of mermaid-entwined shrubbery Ah...Ah...Oh, what marvelous things But they are, they are, they are Giving me the creeps Dark night, hold tight And sleep tight my baby Morning light shall burst bright And keep us here safely
