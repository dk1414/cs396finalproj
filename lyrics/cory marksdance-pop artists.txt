Got a tipsy soul, I'm a rebel and rouge And I'm always on the run With a fire inside I ain't ever gonna die I'm a locked and loaded gun When the matches strike and the gasoline lights It's only just begun One thing I learned is you can watch it all burn But the flame ain't ever done Ooh, Raise 'em up a little higher, your lighters Outlaws and outsiders, ooh Some call me a renegade, the enemy Throw your hands up if you feel the same Whoa, living life at the edge Just say what you wanna say, or walk away I'll stand tall when there's hell to pay Ain't no power higher We're the outlaws and outsiders Mmm, yeah I was born in the dark with a fearless heart And a taste for the other side I was a crazy-ass kid, all the shit I did I'm amazed that I'm still alive They thought I'd change with a little bit of age But you know I never will Takes too much time to walk a straight line I don't have time to killI tried to bow my head Put down the bottle like my grandma said my daddy did I love her like a Waylon song But old number seven was a damn too strong Back road, the radio loud Pushing 85 and burning one down Twist the cap off and pass it around Feeling alright now One thing that I do well is raise some hell Full moon on a Saturday night Throwing down whiskey 'til light I swear I ain't looking for trouble Don't blame me, man, blame it on the double Before the drinks hit the floor We're busting out the front door Black Label's gonna bring out the rebel Don't blame me, man, blame it on the double Fifteen before last call I'm shooting back Jack, she's putting out a fireball Her boots on, nearly six feet tall I wanna love her like a butterfly just like the Dolly song Right girl on the wrong side of town Drunk ex-boyfriend running his mouth Hold my drink, it's about to go down Feeling alright nowI ain't going down, not gonna hit the mat Swing all you want, yeah, I'm swinging right back Say what you want, I don't give a damn Come take a shot, 'cause here I am I walked this desert alone, crawled my way through the dust Built this road on my own, in me I trust Watch your kingdom fall, your daggers turn to rust Been on this trail so long, in me I trust I ain't gonna run, I ain't backing out I'm gonna prove you wrong, you're gonna shut your mouth I'm keeping tabs, I'm keeping score Whatever you get, I'm gettin' more I walked this desert alone, crawled my way through the dust Built this road on my own, in me I trust Watch your kingdom fall, your daggers turn to rust Been on this trail so long— yeah I'm gonna burn it up, I'm gonna tear it down Let's get loudBurn it up Burn it up Burn it up Burn it up, burn it up, burn it up up up Burn it up, burn it up Live like you mean it Burn it up, burn it up Light the gasoline and Burn it up, burn it up Never be defeated Fan the fire and feed it Burn it up Burn it up I know it’s hard to do everything you wanted You’ve come so far to leave empty, hurt, and haunted So strike the match, spark the blaze Watch it all go up in flames Burn it up, burn it up Live like you mean it Burn it up, burn it up Light the gasoline and Burn it up, burn it up Never be defeated Fan the fire and feed it Burn it upMy friends say I should walk away, hell run while you can'Cause you can't trust a woman who's lying to another man She's in your head she's on your mind, just toying you around Tearing up a one-way street when the only way is down This heart of gold don't stand a chance It's the same old song, it's the same old dance Every man's prayer, but a mother's sin Her angel's smile is a devil's grin Your hips, your thighs, your cheating eyes, you got me out of my mind You stole my soul, I stole a kiss, and now I'm doing time Ain't no point in slowing down, there's nothing left to lose I ain't right, and you're no good, it hurts, but that's the truth This heart of gold don't stand a chance It's the same old song, it's the same old dance Every man's prayer, but a mother's sin Her angel's smile is a devil's grin It sounds crazyThis isn’t how I thought this all would go Waiting for contact, come in, ground control Stuck on the tarmac, it’s taking its toll When I could be flying, yeah, I’m gonna be flying All systems ready to go All systems ready to go I’m gonna be flying high again I’m gonna be flying till the end I’m gonna be flying till I’m dead Can’t bring me down where I am Can’t find me when I’m high These wings are made for flying The crowds are pouring in, I can see the sun I know this ain’t right but it’s got to be done Put on my boots and strap on my gun Like a rocket I’m climbing, wheels up, I’m flyingWe were young, we were lost But we travelled not knowing the cost Nothing behind us, just road ahead Unashamed of the things that we did It’s you who asked me to stay It’s you who pushed me away Out in the rain, where I’ve been for days I’ll stay forever here in the storm Out in the rain, until your heart changes I’ve made this weather, this weather my home Out in the rain Days have come days have gone But I’ll stay on this road till it’s done The stars remind me of when we were one Before all of my sky came undone It’s you who’s making this hard It’s you who pushed me this far Out in the rain where I’ve been for days I’ll stay forever here in the storm Out in the rain until your heart changes I’ve made this weather, this weather my home Out in the rainJingle my bells It's Christmas in the U SA Come on and jingle my bells It's Christmas in the U SA It won't be long till we're Wakin' up on Christmas day Go shoppin' in the mornin'To buy a Christmas tree I can't afford the tinsel But that's all right with me The weather's lookin' snowy So Santa won't be late If you be good I know he should be Flyin' through your gate Jingle my bells'Jingle my bells Jingle my bells cause it's Christmas in the U SA Jingle my bells It's Christmas in the U SA Come on and jingle my bells It's Christmas in the U SA It won't be long till we're Wakin' up on Christmas dayI’m feeling lonely Got you on my mind I swear I’ll quit drinking this time But it’s getting harder Letting your memory go Your warm sweet touch with a heart so cold You tell me you love me But where are you now I wanna believe you somehow Wherever you are I hope that you’re fine I’ll be here drinking My whiskey and your wine I see you around From time to time Thinking about those moments Where I was yours and you were mine My friends said to let go But they don’t understand You’re more than a memory With my heart in your hand You tell me you love me But where are you now I wanna believe you somehow Wherever you are I hope that you’re fine I’ll be here drinking My whiskey and your wineGot a tipsy soul, I'm a rebel and rouge And I'm always on the run With a fire inside I ain't ever gonna die I'm a locked and loaded
