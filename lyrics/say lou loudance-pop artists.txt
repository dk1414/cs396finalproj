You never cried I'd say love let me wet your eyes Have some tears of mine Maybe I Should have learned That the soul won't burn If you don't hurt inside You feel no pain That's ok I got plenty left Stored up in my chest I'll top you up With a taste That I've not forgot You made a fool of me Lover You made a fool of me How funny I've been told I am cold Been known to sting Forgive me I have sinned See the iceberg tip I'm a brute shooting from the hip Straight into my heart In the dark You confess That you've made this mess So what you smiling for It's ok there'll be plenty moreBy the way I—Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk Music loud and women warm I've been kicked around since I was born And it's alright, it's okay You may look the other way We can try to understand The New York Times' effect on man Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive-ive Well now, I get low and I get high And if I can't get either, I really try Got the wings of Heaven on my shoes I'm a dancing man and I just can't loseI'll meet you in the city I'll pick you up at night I'll drive you through the suburbs I'll get you there in time I'll meet you in the city I'll stay clear of the light I'll get us through the checkpoints Yeah, I know we'll be alright Oh, Julian Once we get across the border Oh, Julian I'll mend your heart Oh, Julian Once we get across the border Oh, Julian I'll mend your heart And maybe we are sinners But love, it ain't no crime I'll get you through the checkpoints I'll drive us through the night You know I'll keep your secret I've locked it up inside As long as we are moving Yeah, I know it'll be alright Yeah, I know it'll be alrightTo who do you compare me Recreate to mold me In frozen animation You square me up Your words are soft and wooly They strip me up to unveil me I used to feel protection From your touch And if I'm your beloved Then why don't I fit Oh, if I'm your beloved Then why don't I fit here We lie together, but I feel so alone When I give everything I have to you Why is it never enough For me there was nobody You were the one and only But now I'm uninvited Inside your love And if I'm your beloved Then why don't I fit Oh, if I'm your beloved Then why don't I fit here We lie together, but I feel so alone When I give everything I have to you Why is it never enough I lived inside the hidden bay And the time used to pass so slow I raised dragons by my side But I, I had to let them go I feel like we're running wild And we, we gotta let it grow And these days you're by my side But I, I gotta let you know Days of ashes and nights of flames A thirst for beauty, then thirst for games Do you need to see my soul Just let me know When you get high Everything we touch turns to gold at night In the dark we make it special, make it justified Everything we touch turns to gold at night There's a ghost in the machine, and there's a glowing light Now there's a black spot on the sun I can't make it go away I spent light years wasting my time Until I knew your nameThey say that everyday is a new beginning But I know I'm not alone when the darkness hits me We dream all day in black and white And when the sun comes down and we learn to live again We waste away the darkest light And when the sun comes down and we learn to love again It feels better in the dark , it feels better in the dark I feel closer to your heart and nothing can come between us It feels better, it feels better in the dark I feel closer to your heart and nothing can come between us Lights flash before my eyes and the curtain's open I knew the sound A familiar line When the spell is broken We dream all day in black and white And when the sun comes down and we learn to live again We waste away the darkest light And When the sun comes down and we learn to love again It feels better in the dark , it feels better in the dark I feel closer to your heart and nothing can come between us It feels better in the dark , it feels better in the dark I feel closer to your heart and nothing can come between usIt seems your wounds take a lifetime to heal She hurt you young, now you're older You're living life in a fortress of fear Stuck in the past, growing colder Seems the scars on your heart want to bleed Love is lost, shrug your shoulders I know you're hurt, but I've waited for years Let it go, let me hold you I'll be as gentle as I can Love is hard for a man I'll be as gentle as I can Love is hard, love is hard for a man like you Holding on, stop holding on She never said what you wanted to hear I'll say it all, over and over I know you're hurt, but I've waited for years Let it go, like I told you I'll be as gentle as I can Love is hard for a man Oh, I'll make you understand You are safe, in my hands I'll be as gentle as I can Love is hard, love is hard for a man like you I'll be as gentle as I can Love is hard, love is hard for a man like you Holding on, stop holding on Holding on, stop holding onBack down, feet are off the ground I'm lost I don't want to be found I'm in the light1, 2, slipping in the groove You're me and I want to be you Let's kill some time And it's true I always play the fool We're one but I've never touched you It's such a crime, it's new The consequence is cruel Breathe in and surrender to the mood We're going high I need your love Ana, Ana I want your touch Can't get enough Ana, Ana I need your love Ana, Ana You're a wet dream On a television screen Dark eyes, am I staring back at me Oh, she's so fine Goddamn I don't know who I am Oh, Ana can you help me understand Before I lose my mindPin someone against the wall Dial the number, make the call Street lights on the girls ahead Painted cheeks and ruby red Can you hear me Can you hear me screaming loud All that glitter, all that foreign gold Love all night and live before we’re old Drown your sorrows at the bar Touch the sky and count the stars What you get is what you see Shock you like you won’t believe Can you hear me Can you hear me Can you hear me screaming loud All that glitter, all that foreign gold Love all night and live before we’re old Can you hear me Can you hear me screaming loud All that glitter, all that foreign goldThey're gonna cut you to the core Gonna try to cool you down And they'll shame you when you flirt But they'll hate it when you frown But there's fire burning in your bones tonight Desire hiding in your glowing eyes Look through the glass to the other side I see you standing where I used to be I feel you frozen when you could be free Follow me, endlessly Golden child Let your horses run wild They find a way to keep control They'll try to own you with an ancient glance They're gonna set you into stone And then I bet they'll ask "why don't you dance "But there's fire burning in your bones tonight Desire hiding in your glowing eyes Look through the glass to the other side I see you standing where I used to be I feel you frozen when you could be free Follow me, endlessly
