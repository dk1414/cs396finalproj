Girls running down a funky rhyme And this is how we introduce them one at a time Here's a New York City Breaker with moves to shock And extra in the air, they call him Flip Rock Like an acrobat from outer space With fresh air moves all in your face Any move or twist that you insist Is only done by the one at the top of the list To get the best satisfaction of the main attraction Is to know the fresh impulse of the man called Action Now you know their names and the moves they made And if you challenge the crew, your reputation's sustained'Cause in a breakdance battle, they never flake So c'mon everybody, let's rock this break Hold up fly girls, put it all on ice'Cause here's the New York City Breaker they call Kid Nice With knee-neck moves and head glides twice So c'mon everybody, let's rock this breakHere the future is only so near Why should we all be alone Every night on the way home This time we should be starting again Get up I'm counting to 10 Seeing you comb on your hair Pretending that no one is there You know it can be better than that But wait until tomorrow morning Learning to be you is what hurts most Close your eyes and hold your terror close Out here I hear you come in loud and clear I carried you 'til it got dark And then walked you home through the park You're right, strangers are easy to like Thunder and lightning will strike Make the move you'll get the knack Echoes that don't answer back Just please give me a chance to say no But wait until tomorrow morning Learning to be you is what hurts most Close your eyes and hold your terror close
