Stuck here in a life that repeats Living in the now and between Pages from a magazine Instruction manuals for your dreams This is where you stop and rewind This where our dreams all collide Streaming through your heart that was mine Living in my world that was yours through your eyes It was you all along It was you all along Waiting for a life that was allowed Not my own but yours all alone Wide awake until you're home Black on black, roses gold I was yours all along I was yours all along I was yours all along I was yours all along Don't go changing I'm not leaving you Don't go changing I'm not leaving youIs he still coming around like an injured bird needing a nest A place to rest his head in a song you'll regret Still you take him, Lord knows I don't wanna compete Still I sleep in the very sheets he's been in Swallow him whole like a pill that makes you choke, and steals your soul You have the nerve to look me in the eyes and lie Send him back, I won't share the trap that you have me in Is he still coming around like an injured bird needing a nest A place to rest his head in a song you'll regret Still you take him, Lord knows I don't wanna compete Still I sleep in the very sheets he's been in Swallow him whole like a pill that makes you choke, steals your soul You have the nerve to look me in the eyes and lie Send him back, I won't share the trap that you have me inKeeping you close, falling behind I lost my voice, you lost your mind You say you're not well, I say that you're fine Walking with me through the aisles of a drugstore If you return to me, oh, if you return to me Your mother's a fake, a phantom who steals The smile on your face is not what you feel I'll check you in if you check me out Some lonesome wrist cutter who says I'm her brother Oh, if you return to me, oh, if you return to me Was I the ghost or one of your voices You hear in your head when you're out killing horses Who's taking my place, who's taking you home I don't think it's safe to turn out the nightlight And if you return to me, oh, if you return to me I read your reviews, I studied the lines I know them so well, my life's now a tragedy One for the road, two for the plane And I will be fine, as long as you take me And if you return to me, oh, if you return to me It's all right, baby It's all right, baby It's all right, babe It's all rightNever be sorry for the lack of response Your hand on my arm before we were lost The horizon just laughed to see us fall off Your face in a jar I constantly dropped You have him now but I'll have you later The phone is a gossip The clock is a murderer My time is her burden Your voice is his slumber How long have we been here I can't quite remember my name I had you pegged as one who would throw me Away from your shoreline Into the galaxy Where moons are a fool Stars climb eternity Long after voids And handwritten destiny Long after voices return from the telephone Cut off from color And leave everyone you know They'll let you down I'll let you talk into the sky That he keeps turning off like a lightWhen I look back upon my time See the snapshots of my life You will not be surprised To see your name across my smile And I will remember you I will remember you I will remember you The way you are right now And when I first came into view I was older than you knew Always going out of tune Anytime you'd leave the room And I will remember you I will remember you I will remember you The way you are right now When I look back upon my time See the snapshots of my life You will not be surprised To see your name across my smile And I will remember you I will remember you I will remember you The way you are right nowThe angel Moroni asleep in the carport With the newspaper under his arm It seems I was late to deliver his car keys So it looks like we are staying behind Was Lucifer bashful in hiding his face from the Lord Dear Jesus, forgive me, I am only doing as I was told For as it is written, I will soon one day face my own fire And this world will go with me, if I can just get them all on my side Carry me over rainbows and Rainier Carry me over rainbows and Rainier I was late to the parlor, when the wind it blew forward And demanded we get out of town So me and Moroni took the keys to the steeple And awaited Armageddon to go down Place your queens on the table Who are weeping for your daughters Who are waiting for their someday to return Every heart will be broken, prophetic poems spoken From the mouths of every baby to be born Carry me over rainbows and Rainier Carry me over rainbows and RainierI arrived at two from a thought I had Talking with Q in the back of a cab Once we were lost and we never came back I can only exist so long as you laugh Don't give up on me if I ever leave town Ain't it sad to see your life not work out What made you think I would live in your frown As you're waiting around for the witches to drown Allocate I suppose I could be here in the now Still we find ourselves in the previous year Dear Mali H., I'm fed up with myself And the tears I inhaled are not good for my health Allocate Once I was lost and I never came back I can only exist so long as you laugh What made you think I could live in your frown As you're waiting around for the witches to drown Out from my window across from the city I have what's considered a good view Two blocks from the subway, three from the fountain Where I walk to break in new shoes She stands on the sidewalk just waving at taxis Like horses in parades in passing I ask where she's headed, she tells me, "Ohio:I've not seen my mother in ages""It's been a long time, a real long time A real long time"Out from my window "How far is Ohio "She laughed and pointed out east She said, "I grew up there with my dear mother And I haven't seen her since thirteen You see, I was taken while she lay sleeping By my father's hired men We moved to the city so far from our family I haven't been back there since""It's been a long time, a real long time A real long time"Mr  Percy Faith, is your masterpiece complete I'm in dire need of curing this headache There are riots in the streets and We're still not on the moon And I hear that you've been Taken from the airwaves Joseph Raymond Conniff, I am writing from Seattle Where they now have put a trademark on the rain And having just arrived I am staying by the airport It was tough to find a room at the Hyatt Inn Alice in disguises Bill Close taken hostage"Dear Loretta, these are my demands"I'll be selling Arizona to the next potential buyer Who comes in from the north in search of sand Mr  Allan Sherman, I am writing from the future Where the people never look you in the eye And there is no need to talk, and the Sidewalks they walk for you I know everything and yet no one at allAnd when I was the line, you were a light Shining like some planet you call home Talking aloud, was it about The ending or beginning of a word That was with me all along I let go, you held strong Are we all not lost in song Feeding back until we're found I was a line, here on rewind Living out the voices in my mind Talking aloud, distorted in sound Are we are not stars here on the ground You were with me all along I let go, and you held strong Are we all not lost in song Feeding back until we're found And in the golden hours hue The darkest of the few Was with me all along And sewn into the sounds of joy The forms of light collide In the walls of my eyes
