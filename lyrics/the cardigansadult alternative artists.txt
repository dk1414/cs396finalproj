Dear, I fear we're facing a problem You love me no longer, I know and Maybe there is nothing that I can do To make you do Mama tells me I shouldn't bother That I ought just stick to another man A man that surely deserves me But I think you do So I cry, and I pray, and I beg Love me, love me Say that you love me Fool me, fool me Go on and fool me Love me, love me Pretend that you love me Leave me, leave me Just say that you need me So I cry and I beg for you to Love me, love me Say that you love me Leave me, leave me Just say that you need me I can't care 'bout anything but youI don't know what you're looking for You haven't found it baby, that's for sure You rip me up, you spread me all around In the dust of the deed of time And this is not a case of lust, you see It's not a matter of you versus me It's fine the way you want me on your own But in the end it's always me alone And I'm losing my favourite game You're losing your mind again I'm losing my baby, losing my favourite game I only know what I've been working for Another you so I could love you more I really thought that I could take you there But my experiment is not getting us anywhere I had a vision I could turn you right A stupid mission and a lethal fight I should've seen it when my hope was new My heart is black and my body's blueOh, I think you're standing on my left foot It's hurting but that's okay'Cause I'm in your way You'll break that foot that you're standing on I'll walk with the other one Do what you want to do what you want to Be what you want to be what you want to Go on and step on me You're free to have everything you can see All that you want from me Free to be all that you want to be Do what you want with me Oh, I think you're spinning inside my head I think of you all the day'Cause you're in my way Oh, I think you're holding the heart of mine Squeeze it apart, that's fine Do what you want to do what you want to Be what you want to be what you want to Go on and step on meHmm-hmm Hmm-hmm-hmm Hey, what did you hear me say You know the difference it makes What did you hear me say Yes, I said it's fine before But I don't think so no more I said it's fine before I've changed my mind I take it back Erase and rewind Cause I'll be changing my mind Erase and rewind Cause I'll be changing my mind I've changed my mind So where did you see me go It's not the right way, you know Where did you see me go For twenty-seven years I've been trying To believe and confide in Different people I've found Some of them got closer than others And some wouldn't even bother And then you came around I didn't really know what to call you You didn't know me at all But I was happy to explain I never really knew how to move you So I tried to intrude through The little holes in your veins And I saw you But that's not an invitation That's all I get If this is communication I disconnect I've seen you, I know you But I don't know How to connect So I disconnect You always seem to know where to find me And I'm still here behind you In the corner of your eye I'll never really learn how to love you But I know that I love you Through the hole in the sky Where I see youI will never know Cause you will never show Come on and love me now Come on and love me now I will never know Cause you will never show Come on and love me now Come on and love me now Come on and love me now Carnival Came by my town today Bright lights from giant wheels Fall on the alleyways And I'm here By my door Waiting for you I will never know Cause you will never show Come on and love me now Come on and love me now I will never know Cause you will never show Come on and love me now Come on and love me now Come on and love me nowHey baby come around Keep holding me down And I'll be keeping you up tonight A four letter word got stuck in my head The dirtiest word that I've ever said It's making me feel alright For what it's worth I love you And what is worse I really do For what it's worth I'm going to run, run, run Till the sweetness gets to you And what is worse I love you Hey please baby come back There'll be no more loving attacks And I'll be keeping it cool tonight The four letter word is out of my head Come on around get back in my bed Keep making me feel alright For what it's worth I like you And what is worse I really do Things have been worse and we had fun fun fun Till I said I love you And what is worse I really doMan, I've had a few But they wouldn't quite blow me like you You gave me your name and signed With a halo around my eye And it hit me like never before That love is a powerful force Yes, it struck me that love is a sport So I pushed you a little bit more Love, you're news to me You're a little bit more than I thought you'd be A mole in my well-fed lawn You're a nightmare beating the dawn And it hit me like never before That love is a powerful force Yes, it struck me that love is a sport So I pushed you a little bit more Blue, blue, black and blue Red blood sticks like glue True love is cruel love Red blood's a power fuel Sweet love, tasty blood My heart over floodsI came home in the morning and everything was gone Oh, what have I done I dropped dead in the hallway Cursing the dawn Oh come on, sun, why must I burn I'm just trying to learn I stared into the light to kill some of my pain It was all in vain, 'cause no senses remained But an ache in my body And regret on my mind But I'll be fine'Cause I live and I learn Yes, I live and I learn If you live, you will learn And I live and I learn Got kicked in the head So I started a fight'Cause I knew I was right But I learned I was wrong I remember a slaughter I remember I fought for the money I'd broughtSit Good dog Stay Bad dog Whoo Down Roll over Well, here's a good man and a pretty young girl Trying to play together somehow I'm wasting my life, you're changing the world I get drunk and watch your head grow It's the good times that we shared And the bad times that we'll have It's the good times And the bad times that we had Well it's been a long slow collision I'm a pitbull, you're a dog Baby you're foul in clear conditions But you're handsome in the fog So I need some fine wine And you, you need to be nicer For the good times and the bad times That we'll have
