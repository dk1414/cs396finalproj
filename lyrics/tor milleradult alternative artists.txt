Oh, how I let you fall from under me I walked away, never looking back To chase, the remnants of a fleeting dream That couldn't wait, just wouldn't wait for me Heartbeat like it never could stop Tunnel vision in my mind, won't be giving you up this time, no Running wild, trying to set myself free Lost sight of what was standing right in front of me This time And all the while the world It hit me with the speed of sound And don't you worry girl I'm always going to be around Won't bat a lash, just like Carter and Cash Now, I walked this line right next to you With every step, the closer that we'll get Caught, in a fever that's so pure and true We'll paint the town, until it all burns downMaybe I hate being alone Holding you through a cellphone And running hard from the miles If I could break all the fast clocks Would it make all the noise stop Could we be still for a while I'm probably gonna let you down Oh oh oh Lying awake in a fever Call me a cold sweat believer I will be loving you always, always, always Heart beating louder than thunder If you are ever to wonder I will be loving you Always, always, always I'm looking for lights on the runaway Can you forgive all my mistakes And wipe the blood from my hands Take me from the City of Angels All the stars and the fables Show me somewhere To land, land, landI left home about a week ago I never really had a brain of my own Back then I had an ego Thinking that the world was so damn small And it's like the lawn is on fire Like the fumes might get me high And baby blue, what should I do Will I feel so lost without you And I'm deaf, dumb, blind and out of touch Your eyes got so big Who can I trust And I feel so far from your side And when I look up I start to cry You're a darker hue My baby blue And I've re-read the same page Never comprehending what the words have to say I'm always on the next stage Living for a moment that never comes my way And it's like my number is retired Like we always knew our linesJeff Buckley's grace was playing loud as hell In the back of an old dive bar So I step outside and light a cigarette Take in the fumes of the passing cars Loud angry drunks and a few crust punks Fill every crevasse of St  Marks Some things have changed since back then But the streets are still so hard In the lonely hour of midnight When New York City's lying wide awake Under the glow of a street light I feel the rumble that the concrete makes I might hail a cab down Right thru the Holland to the interstate And my soul reignites In the lonely hour of midnight Two lovers falling in each others arms Stumbling on down the highline Up on the bridge there's a broken heart Screaming to his valentine Two sunken eyes at the cornershop Trying to get a loosey for a dime The needle drops and the vinyl turns I'm gonna burn this one rightBaby I, baby I surrender Baby I, baby I surrender Baby I, baby I surrender Baby I, baby I surrender Give my records back But keep my sweater on It’s gonna be a cold december Maybe we ran out of electricity Maybe we're too young our hearts too tender But the tail lights over the bridge are already fading One less night with you One less avenue One less moment to remember One more L-train stop And one last look at you And no more playing the pretender Baby I surrender, uh Baby baby I surrender, uh You call at 2am but I won’t pick up Every sidewalk will be wider than an ocean I'll delete your name, erase my history It will feel just like a revolution, ohI first saw you on Great Jones You were singing out loud With your headphones on Well Lady Stardust is my favourite song I didn’t even care you got every word wrong Now I can't find you in the crowd In my head I see you over and over again I stood outside the cinema You've set me up in flames My heart is still stuck In Washington Square Park Waiting in the neon baby I just want to know where you are And why it feels like I'm going crazy Now the night always seems so dark In Washington Square Park Above skyscrapers under every stone Are you hiding somewhere In the midnight shadows It said post no bills but I put up signs Stood on the corner handing out flyers No I won't stop until you're mineEvery evening on my way back home I keep myself composed, pretending we’ll be fine But I'll be leaving and you'll be wake up alone Even though you've always known, it still makes you cry I know every hour that passes by Turning roses into ashes, I made heaven a hell And made it harder on myself I go round and choose my words carefully So I won't give it all away, all away By now girl you see right through me Throwing it all the way, all the way To the ground we all fall down It'd be easy if I did something wrong If what we had wasn't so strong If it was all a lie but we both know that What we have is pure gold The kind of thing that you don't let go for all your life I wish I could stay and talk to you And say the things I know you want me to Ending this frustration with a candid conversationI feel like I'm standing on a mountain Where everyone can see me In the worst way All of these eyes on me expecting But I can't find a thing to say Headlights Casting my shadow On the clouds behind me Darkening all that define me In all that blinding confusion How did I ever find you In a life of second guessing I knew that first glance I would let you in In the emotion of the moment I gave myself to chance Thought of where we'd go Not of what I'd been Headlights I'm weak and I'm hollow With the weight of my own head Too heavy on my bones Headlights I'm eager to follow So many things unsaid And so much still unknown Headlights Clearing the shadow On the clouds behind me I'm free for you to define me With nothing else in my vision How did I ever lose you You are into the wild Always a wild child The pulse of their lives is too calm and mild No structured living No plans to walk down the aisle Parents wish for college Though you'd think they're in denial They wouldn't vote you queen of the homecoming Though you didn't really want to be Organized sports and much counselling Pushed you over, sent you packing Crust punk queen Left mom and dad when you were 17 And tore up those jet black jeans Hopped on a train into a troubled scene With all the trust fund drug fiends Who don't care about the Don't seem to care about the American dream Who don't care about the American dream From my own prison I hear my stomach grumble My father's footsteps are so far apart that I could stumble I see who walks upon the cracks of the concrete jungle I wish I could just fall apart so you would help me crumbleBeneath the blood moon, all filled with wine You say you love me for the very first time And as the three words fire from your teeth Like some perfect bullet to knock me off my feet I'll be loving you, too The shadow of your heart, it cuts right through And as you fall for some decent man You place your life into his trembling hands And as the red sun struggles up in the sky With his arms around you, and your dreaming eyes I'll be loving you, too The shadow of your heart, it cuts right through I'll be loving you, too From your lips to the dirt they lower me down into And as I make love to another one Your name is riding on the tip of my tongue And as a body crashes on me like a wave My resolve may weaken, but never break
