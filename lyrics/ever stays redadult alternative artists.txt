With this voice you gave I will sing As I come into this place As I fall before You Cause the Son has bled for me I can come into this place Pre-Chorus:I can fall before You Place all before You I can fall before You Chorus:Rain down Let Your spirit burn in me Burn with fire Rain down Turn Your ear to hear this cry Consume my life May all these wrongs wash away As I come into this place As I fall before You Cause the blood was shed for me I can come into this place I can fall before You Place all before You Let us fall before You GodEverytime I lift my hands Everytime I close my eyes Everytime I enter in Your Glory fills this place oh Lord And I am taken Chorus:Cause in Your presence flowers bloom My spirit floods I'm made anew Your beauty reigns from the sky Cleanse my heart and touch my mind And from your throne Your glory flows This peace it feels my soul And I hush As I see Your love unfold I will stand and not grow weary I will run and will not faint Your rod and staff they guide me Your love restores my soul Your love restores my soul God You restore meLadies and Gentlemen Boys and Girls Hold your breath Make a wish Count to threeI'll let the whole world know That You are holy I'll let my lifestlye show That You're the only Lord, I am not ashamed To say I live for You And I will live to proclaim Your name to anyone I'll let the whole world know That You are holy And I am not afraid To be a light unto You And I will let my light shine Bright before everyone I'll let the whole world know That You are holy I'll let my lifestlye show That You're the only One real truth Chorus:Because You gave Your son to die On the cross for me And daily I will take up my cross And I'll follow You Until the whole world knowsYou never fake the red across your wrist There's never been a mascara that could fix The saddest eyes a boy has ever seen When you want so desperately to bleed We were never meant for this So worried, on we'd run So put your head inside your mind Together we'll...Run until the world goes dark When we're all alone I swear I will Run into the darkest night And bring back the stars To light up the skies You try to hide the bruises on your skin You are never gonna hide those buried in The coldest eyes a boy has ever felt To hear you say that you're the one to blame We're not the cause of this These things were broke before So put your head inside your mind Together we'll...Run until the world goes dark When we're all alone I swear I will Run into the darkest night And bring back the stars To light up the skiesRain fell that day when the sky went black on everyone These things we're told not to talk about, not to Anyone When You fell you took the fall for everything that I Had ever done So help me never forget just how beautiful the sky Could be You have lifted me just like the taste of falling rain And my world has never felt, it has never felt the same Yesterday I was six feet under ground and now I'm on my Knees And I can't explain, I can't explain any of this It's coming down I close my eyes to feel the rain like It could wash away a thousand years of heartbreak So just a little, let the rain fall down Oh oh oh oh Wash away these wounds that cut me down Oh oh oh oh You have lifted me just like the taste of falling rain And my world has never felt, it has never felt the same Yesterday I was six feet under ground and now I'm on my Knees And I can't explain, I can't explain any of thisTo spend one day with You Is a thousand times better than I never knew Life could be Cause when I'm with You All I see is good in me To say You love is true Is as if I were to say I think the sky is blue Inside of me You're blue As blue as blue could ever be Pre-Chorus:And You take there And You take me there And You take me there Won't you take me I wanna go I wanna go Chorus:To spend one day with You Makes me feel Like I could fly away Fly away and leave this life To spend one day with You Makes me see that You're the only way Only way to get his highAnd before Your throne we come And we honour You, Lord And before Your throne we humbly bow And we exalt Your Name With everything we have With everything we have Hear the

they're too afraid Today will fade away Just as soon as the sun takes its place So save today Don't you waste away For tomorrow will soon be today Save today Don't wait for them For their lives are all but spent So you learn to live above the rest All lights shine green So be who you want to be And I'll let You show me how Should you really ever feel Like your life is too far gone Just try again'Cause we only ever get But one chance to live this life So let's begin
