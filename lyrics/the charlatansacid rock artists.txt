The only one I know Has come to take me away The only one I know Is mine when she stitches me The only one I see Has found an aching in me The only one I see Has turned her tongue into me Everyone has been burned before Everybody knows the pain The only one I know Never cries, never opens her eyes The only one I know Wide awake and then she's away The only one I see Is mine when she walks down the street The only one I see Has carved her way into meHey, country boy Hey, country boy What are you sad about Everyday you make the sun come out Even in the pouring rain I'll come to see you And I'll save you, I'll save you What do you care about And she said "this and that"What do I mean to you I'll show you if you want the truth I can't remember I don't know how to tell you But I love you just the same How many eyes must a young girl have I know she makes you cry I know she makes you laugh I'll be good to you if I could I'd make you happy If I had a son I'd be good to my daddy Who loves you though I bet it's not the same As your north country boy Hey country boy What are you sad about I think we'll work it out Even in the morning rain He'll come to see you Hope your feelings are the sameWe fill our thoughts with everyday reminders And no remorse for winning none the wiser You can tell when we came together How long it lasts that's where it stays We know each other I get the love that you're sending Let the good times be never ending We know each other I get the love that you're sending Let the good times be never ending And in-between a place for new beginnings To fill our dreams instead we keep on winning Take the past send present to the future Make it last slow down we'll get there sooner We know each other I get the love that you're sending Let the good times be never ending We know each other I get the love that you're sending Let the good times be never endingMost of the time you are happy You're a weirdo And before the introduction ends There is someone feeling sorry for themselves Look at your ugly shame What are you talking for Look at your ugly shame Most of the time you are demanding What am I doing here and I don't want to Be And the hurt in which you bare You could say goodbye to this earth Look at your ugly shame What are you talking for Look at your ugly shame There's too much for me to know about Most of the time you are happy You're a weirdo And your nerve is my device And it makes me sadI too feel the plastic machinery I know it's hard to be accepted Our life is just like a dream to me At times it's good to be rejected So, let's just run Even if Only in our heads Leave all of this behind Unless we could stand still It's not that we have no interest It's not that we don't think it's worth it Oh wait I am such an idiot My shoulders find this hard to take it You can tell me, tonight If not this time Your thoughts don't need Don't need to be confined I feel it too This broken world There is no second chance Our flags unfoldMy beautiful friend I will pay attention don't say this is the end I find it hard to describe you To point and discover you Could I tell you once again Ah-oh Ah-oh My beautiful friend Let me sleep and I will feed you when you're hungry Forever live inside of me Through the holes in the pockets of my clothes High, as high as an angel I will stand there beside you Love is all we need Ah-oh, ah-oh My, my, my beautiful friend Ah-oh, ah-oh My, my, my beautiful friend My beautiful friend I swear I adore you Ain't no woman deep enough I don't know how we made it this far dear Without losing at least an ear I could leave us, I could leave us a painting Our lives are-a-changingJoy, it’s such a joy Watching the smile on your face Your love get up at my face We are working it through A solution for you and for me Nothing between what will be Come home baby Come home baby Kiss me gently I can't wait Don't hesitate Let's be together Words can mean many things Watching you step in time Leaving the bad days behind No one can take your place Maybe I'm out of step Maybe I'm out of my depthI wanna bomb your submarines You don't do anything for me You were sometimes hard to find You were never safe to be with, then You, you're nothing next to me I'm a phenomena you see You were sometimes hard to find You were never safe to be with, then Furious again, furious again You don't do anything for me We´re a phenomena you see You were sometimes hard to find You were never safe to be with, thenThis one knows she comes and goes And when she goes she goes This one knows she comes and goes And when she goes she goes Sproston Green she used to pace me And now she hasn't got the time I know I'm too necessary And everything she stole was mine This one knows she comes and goes And when she goes she goes This one knows she comes and goes And when she goes she goes Sproston Green she used to pace me And now she hasn't got the time I know I'm too necessary And everything she stole was mineLet all the pretty ones come on to me I have deity and dignity With your inner sense I'll come for free But shutters hide me in this property Let all the pretty ones come on to me I have deity and dignity With your inner sense I'll come for free But shutters hide me in this property I will sit back down and wait For a chance I will create With words I anticipate Games I will participate Dark blinds drawn will lose the day I would rather live this way I don't want my mind to stray So I keep the world at bay Out with the stranger hands on my mouth Lost in a concrete undergrowth Another disaster only tells me is true Hope I recover long after we're through When will you come and save yourself Stop me, I am drifting, I'm tired of myself I'm tired of myself, trying to control Your pure soul, your pure soul
