You've got your ball, you got your chain Tied to me tight, tie me up again Who's got their claws in you my friend Into your heart I'll beat again Sweet like candy to my soul Sweet you rock, and sweet you roll Lost for you, I'm so lost, for you Oh, when you come Crash into me And I come into you And I come into you In a boy's dream, in a boy's dream Touch your lips just so I know In your eyes, love, it glows so I'm bare boned, and crazy for you Oh, when you come Crash into me Yeah, baby, when I come into you In a boy's dream, a boys dreamHe wakes up in the morning Does his teeth bite to eat and he's rolling Never changes a thing The week ends, the week begins She thinks, we look at each other Wondering what the other is thinking But we never say a thing These crimes between us grow deeper Take these chances Place them in a box until a quieter time Lights down, you up and die Goes to visit his mommy She feeds him well his concerns He forgets them And remembers being small Playing under the table and dreaming Take these chances Place them in a box until a quieter time Lights down, you up and dieThe day you came Naked, afraid Young mother screams and pushes you The day you came Oh joy begin Weak little thing More precious there’ll be nothing, no Oh joy begin Let’s not forget these early days Remember we begin the same We lose our way in fear and pain Oh joy begin First just one step One word and then With laughter sing, oh life begin First just one step Let’s not forget these early days Remembering we began the same We lose our way in fear and hate Oh joy begin Innocent kiss Black magic bliss First broken bone Sudden and swift Oh innocence Let’s not forget these early days Remember we begin the same We lose our way in fear and pain Oh joy begin Oh joy beginWe were above You were standing underneath us We were not yet lovers Dragons were smoked Bumblebees were stinging us I was soon to be crazy Eat, drink, and be merry For tomorrow we'll die Eat, drink, and be merry For tomorrow we'll die'Cause we're tripping billies We're wearing nothing Nothing but our shadows Shadows falling down on the beach sand Remembering once, out on the beaches We wore pineapple grass bracelets So why would you care To get out of this place You and me and all our friends Such a happy human raceThere is a time for holding onto And there is a time for letting go You said "Come on let's go outside and then I'm gonna make you, I'm gonna make you Shoot straight into me, baby Cupid's arrow into my heart Because of you, girl, beautiful, beautiful girl Take it easy on yourself and make it easy on me'Cause I just wanna make you, I just wanna make you Come on, come on, come on, come As if the stars shine, just to reflect in your eyes As if the rain falls, to run down your cheeks to your smile Look at me like the sun and I'm flying You look away and I wanna jump out of my mind Shoot straight into me, babe Cupid's arrow into you, babeI say my hell is the closet I'm stuck inside Can't see the light And my heaven is a nice house in the sky Got central heating and I'm alright Yeah, yeah, yeah, can't see the light Keep it locked up inside don't talk about it T-t-talk about the weather Yeah, yeah, yeah, can't see the light Open up my head and let me out little baby Cause here we have been standing for a long long time Treading trodden trails for a long long time I say my hell is the closet I'm stuck inside Can't see the light And my heaven is a nice house in the sky Got central heating and I'm alright Cause here we have been standing for a long long time Treading trodden trails for a long long time, time, time, time, time, time, time I find sometimes it's easy to be myself Sometimes I find it's better to be somebody else I see you young and soft oh

sitting on my front step I remember waiting for you to walk past You're just a dream to a little kid But I'll catch up to you one day And we'll laugh how things have changed You never dreamed we'd end up this way But I dreamed about it every day I'm not gonna pull your hair I fall so hard Inside the idea of you That's why with you Can't say what I mean Wanna stay, but I Think I'm getting outta here I fall so hard Inside the idea of you I stumble, fall In front of you and all your friends You pick me up You brush me off I grin, but I wanna disappear One day, when you fall for me, babe And I remember this day And I won't brush you off, baby And I'm not gonna Kick you in your shinsUp and down the puppies' hair Fleas and ticks jump everywhere Cause of original sin Down the hill fell Jack and Jill And you came tumbling after Cause of original sin Rip away the tears Drink a hope to happy years And you may find A lifetime's passed you by What would you say Don't drop the big one If you a monkey on a string Don't cut my lifeline If you a doggie on a chain Don't bite the mailman What would you say I was there when the bear Ate his head, thought it was a candy Everyone goes in the end Knock, knock on the door Who's it for  There's nobody in here Look in the mirror, my friendDon't go on the next plane the next plane Love you cause I can't stop I need you cause it won't stop I love you, cause I cause I can't stop Don't wanna thank you, but it won't stop I'm like a junkie for you, baby I have tripped and fallen into This not beautiful but beautiful I have found myself in a beautiful place But I know that I will lose my soul So hungry, you make me So hungry, you make me So hungry, you make me I surrender I'm cold like a junkie for you I burn just like a junkie for you, baby I love you cause I can't stop And I need you, but it won't stop Oh I don't want to thank you, but I but I can't stop You know that I want to leave you, oh, but it won't stop I'm like a junkie for you babyCome out come out No use in hiding Come now come now Can you not see There's no place here What were you expecting Not room for both Just room for me So you will lay your arms down Yes I will call this home Away away You have been banished Your land is gone And given me And here I will spread my wings Yes I will call this home What's this you say You feel a right to remain Then stay and I will bury you What's that you say Your father's spirit still lives in this place I will silence you
