I shouldn't be alone with you tonight Desire was to strong to put up a fight I don't understand the way I feel Although it feels so right I really shouldn't be...Here tonight In your eyes there's a sign of intensity I sense an atmosphere No need to hide from the way that you feel inside There's nothing left to fear If only for tonight I wanna take this chance Risk it all for you Knowing what im gonna do If only for tonight I want it all from you Tonight You're on my mind all of the time I really shouldn't stay with you tonight But the more and more I think of it The more it just seems right Thats why I shouldn't be...Here tonightYou mean more to me than anything I swear to God you know that it's true You showed me how love could be so beautiful I can't conceive the thought of living through One night without you here Asleep next to me I've always known inside I was the lucky one To have the right to call you my own To find someone who understands the give and take It just don't come easy in this world But now I sit alone Just wondering if I've thrown it all away I didn't mean to hurt you baby I didn't mean to let you down No, I didn't mean the things I said or did No way, no how I didn't mean to disappoint you I didn't mean to tell you lies No, I didn't mean to hurt you baby And I won't forgive myself Till I make it alright Gonna make it alright How could I have ever been so foolish When you put so much faith in me I feel the shame, I feel the pain of hurting you I can't hold my head up to anyone I hope I have not lost The only thing, the only thing I ever lovedRing out the old, bring in the new A midnight wish to share with you Your lips are warm, my head is light Were we in love before tonight I don't need a crowded ballroom everything I want is here If you're with me next year will be The perfect year No need to hear the music play You eyes say all there is to say The stars can fade and they can shine'Long as your face is next to mine I don't need a crowded ball room everything I need is here If you're with me next year will be The perfect year We don't need a crowded ballroom everything we need is here If you're with me next year will be The perfect year It's New Year's Eve and hopes are high Dance one year in, kiss one goodbye Another chance, another start So many dreams to tease the heartI just can't control How I feel about you And I'm so surprised With the way I act When you're around I know they never see All the things that I see They don't understand Just what it is That we have found Well I don't care what they say I've made up my mind anyway'Cos you've got the love that I need And I wouldn't change it for anything There ain't no man Makes me feel like you do There ain't no man Ain't no doubt There ain't no man Makes me feel like you do There ain't no man That I've ever found I simply love the times That we spend together And I love the things That you say to me When we're alone There isn't any doubt In the way I'm feeling And I hope the way That I'm feeling now Will never goRemember the day that we first met How you drove me crazy But I always knew that we'd connect It was meant to be And I, I know the we've got something special In my heart I know that we, we belong together All the possibilities Just as long as we're together There is nothing that we can't do There's no door that we can't open As long as its me and you Cos we got a special kind of love We got a special king of love You make me happy whenever I'm blue I can count on you To groove me and release my frustration And turn it into something good You give love incredible, so special Is the love we share and we We belong together All the possibilities They say that nothing lasts forever But we got it going on We'll hold on through stormy weather With a love so strongMind I want your mind to feed me with the knowledge Of how to love you When to love you And where you want to be loved Let your mind go Enlighten me to your thoughts, dreams and fantasies Body Your body is an extension of desire and love I want your body to make love Express love Re-create love exclusively to me Soul The soul is the breath of life That comes from the flow of all things Belonging to your soul is a sweet, sweet dream Sweet, sweet dream Mind, body and soul Out of nowhere You appear on the scene I can see you Like a cool summer breeze I can feel you Your eyes burning into me I knew right away It was obvious to seeI've been searching a long time For someone exactly like you I've been travelling all around the world Waiting for you to come through Someone like you You make it all worthwhile Someone like you Keeps me satisfied Someone exactly like you I been doing some soul searching To find out where you're at I've been up and down the highway In all kinds of foreign lands Someone like you You make it all worthwhile Someone like you Keep me satisfied You, baby I've been all around the world Marching to the beat of a different drum But just lately, I've realised Baby, the best is yet to comeThere's never a day you're not on my mind There isn't a tear that I have not cried, haven't cried You told me that you would be leaving me You said you'd be going this time The thought of you gone forever Never, never crossed my mind Why did I let you go How could I have been so wrong Why did I let you go And how could I be so wrong I may have mistreated you sometime But you can't tell me the fault's all mine, all mine Those empty words that you hurt me with Still run through my mind But that won't change that I That I feel inside Why did I let you go How could I have been so wrong Why did I let you go And how could I be so wrong You told me that you would be leaving me You said you'd be going this time The thought of you gone forever It never, never crossed my mindI know about all your faults Somehow they never deter me And there are times when we talk You really know how to soothe me There are times I look at you And I realise that you need me too But after all is said and done There's nothing sweeter So close to you And it feels so good So close to you And it feels so good So close to you Feels so good Sometimes you say that I'm cold Don't ever think that you'll lose me I'll never tire of your hold'Cos you know just how to move me Well, you're aware as I am too That there's good and bad in the things we do But after all is said and done There's nothing sweeterFeels like a lifetime away When I heard you say I love you And it doesn't feel quite the same Going through the day Without your loving arms to ease the pain I would surely go insane But I know we're gonna be with love again Though you may be far away And I have is yesterday I can't stop the world from turning Only you can stop the hurting Though you may be far away Time and space will not erase The look of pain upon your face Said everything you could not say I know as sure as I breathe Love will always bring you back to me If I had to fall in love again I wouldn't hesitate If it was with you But love's story had to go and change One thing remains I will never be in love this way again You know my heart's with you Even when I can't be next to you
