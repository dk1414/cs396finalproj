ever feel already buried deep Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing Do you know that there's still a chance for you 'Cause there's a spark in you You just gotta ignite the light And let it shine Just own the night Like the Fourth of July'Cause baby, you're a firework Come on show 'em what you're worth Make 'em go, "Awe, awe, awe"As you shoot across the sky-y-y Baby, you're a

those hungry eyes You could use some sugar'Cause your levels ain't right I'm a five-star Michelin A Kobe flown in You want what I'm cooking, boy Let me take you Under candlelight We can wine and dine A table for two And it's okay If you take your time Eat with your hands, fine I'm on the menuI used to bite my tongue and hold my breath Scared to rock the boat and make a mess So I sat quietly, agreed politely I guess that I forgot I had a choice I let you push me past the breaking point I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything You held me down, but I got up Already brushing off the dust You hear my voice, you hear that sound Like thunder, gonna shake the ground You held me down, but I got up Get ready 'cause I've had enough I see it all, I see it now I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter Dancing through the fire'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar Louder, louder than a lion'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh You're gonna hear me roarSummer after high school, when we first met We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof Talked about our future like we had a clue Never planned that one day I'd be losing you In another life, I would be your girl We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world In another life, I would make you stay So I don't have to say you were the one that got away The one that got away I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash Never one without the other, we made a pact Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa Someone said you had your tattoo removed Saw you downtown, singing the blues It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse But in another life, I would be your girl We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world In another life, I would make you stay So I don't have to say you were the one that got away The one that got awayI'm losing my self-control Yeah, you’re starting to trickle back in But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole Cross my heart, I won't do it again I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"And I do, I do But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line And I think of you Two years and just like that My head still takes me back Thought it was done, but I Guess it’s never really over Oh, we were such a mess But wasn't it the best Thought it was done, but I Guess it's never really over Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again And I'll have to get over you all over again Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it's really over And if I think it over, maybe you’ll be coming over again And I'll have to get over you all over againThis was never the way I planned Not my intention I got so brave, drink in hand Lost my discretion It's not what I'm used to Just wanna try you on I'm curious for you Caught my attention I kissed a girl and I liked it The taste of her cherry chapstick I kissed a girl just to try it I hope my boyfriend don't mind it It felt so wrong, it felt so right Don't mean I'm in love tonight I kissed a girl and I liked it I liked it No, I don't even know your name It doesn't matter You're my experimental game Just human nature It's not what good girls do Not how they should behave My head gets so confused Hard to obeyI got a dirty mind, I got filthy ways I'm tryna bathe my ape  in your Milky Way I'm a legend, I'm irreverent, I be reverend I'll be so far up-up-up-up-up, we don't give a fuh-uh-uck Welcome to the danger zone, step into the fantasy You are not invited to the other side of sanity They callin' me an alien, a big headed astronaut Maybe it's because ya boy Yeezy get ass a lot You're so hypnotizing Could you be the devil  Could you be an angel Your touch, magnetizing Feels like I am floating, leaves my body glowing They say, "Be afraid"You're not like the others, futuristic lover Different D NA They don't understand you You're from a whole 'nother world A different dimension You open my eyes And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light
