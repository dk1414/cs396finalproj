wild things go They go along to take your honey Break down, now weep, build up breakfast Now let’s eat, my love, my love, love, love Muscle to muscle and toe to toe The fear has gripped me, but here I

tears limbs like rags Burst so high, finally Capa lands Mine is a watery pit Painless with immense distance From medic, from colleague, friend, enemy, foe Him five yards from his leg From you, Taro Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh Do not spray into eyes I have sprayed you into my eyes3:10 pm: Capa pends death Quivers, last rattles, last chokes All colours and cares glaze to grey Shriveled and stricken to dots The left hand grasps what the body grasps not Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Le photographe est mort3.1415, alive, no longer my amour Fated for home, May of '54 Doors open like arms, my love Painless with a great closeness To Capa, to Capa Capa dark after nothing Reunited with his legTralala, Trala–, Tra-a-la, –la Tralala, Trala–, Tra-a-la, –la Tralala, Trala–, Tra-a-la, –la Tralala,

did I know then That the Mandela Boys soon become Mandela Men Tall woman Pull the pylons down And wrap them around the necks Of all the feckless men that queue to be the next Steepled fingers Ring

your right's in grip With another left hand Watch his right hand slip Towards his gun Oh, no I tackle, we tussle And oh my days, we're rolling My right hand's gripped on his Colt single-action army Oh, no Well, your left hand's free And your right's in grip With another left hand Watch his right hand slip Towards his gun Oh, noBite chunks out of me You're a shark and I'm swimming My heart still thumps as I bleed And all your friends come sniffing Triangles are my favourite shape Three points where two lines meet Toe to toe, back to back, let's go My love, it's very late'Til morning comes Let's tessellate Go alone, my flower And keep my whole lovely you Wild green stones, alone, my lover And keep us on my heart Three guns and one goes off One's empty, one's not quick enough One burn, one red, one grin Search the graves while the camera spins Chunks of you will sink down to seals Blubber rich in mourning They'll nosh you up, yes, they'll nosh the love away But it's fair to say, you

really wants it to be Whiskey soda please, your G&T is empty Jeff's inflatables have sunk to the bottom Pool, summer, summer, pool, pool summer Kiss me Cali let's dive, dive down To the pool's bottom
