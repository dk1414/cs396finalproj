Monday, come slowly, I feel a bit outta touch With all this daily heartache, it hurts me so much I cannot help it if I am hard to love There's things about me that you don't know I don't like actin' tough You can be serious, and I can be mysterious Share my feelings everyday, but you'll just smile at me and say I love you baby, and I love you doll Times they get tough but my heart won't change at all I love you baby, and I love you doll Tuesday, come gently, I feel a little blue I used to shine in deep bright red when I was with you Now everything changed, only, I stayed the same All my blue skies turned to gray, and all my flowers turned away You can be serious, and I can be mysterious Share your feelings everyday, but I'll just smile at you and say I love you baby, and I love you doll Times they get tough but my heart won't change at all I love you baby and I love you dollPhilosophize me Tranquillize​ me Hand in hand, we will stand You will dream beside me There are thoughts and And there are worries Sometimes it feels like my heart is in a hurry'Cause I've got a New York state of mind In Indian Standard Time Sometimes it just don't seem to fit My heart is in a mess and my soul is in a fix It just don't fit Philosophize your alibis and make trouble into play Who knows  You just might believe it someday Philosophize your alibis to make it all seem ok'Cause we don't think, like your first kiss Sometimes it goes away There are thoughts and And there are worries Sometimes it feels like my heart is in a hurry Generalize me Paralyze me Whatever you do, you cannot immobilize meSometimes I get much closer than I intend The other times I just like to sit out on the fence Most times I can't even tell the difference I'm partially a ghost Don't you get too close I love you way more than you know I'm partially a ghost We tried to go back to the way that it was back then It is the best thing to do when trouble ends But then, why did the world make me what I am within Uh-oh, uh-oh I'm partially a ghost Don't you get too close I love you way more than you know I'm partially a ghost Change my life just upon a whim Jump into the ocean, learn to swim Gone for summer, winter, all the seasons I guess that might be the reason That I am a ghostMy summer skin is growing thin Now I need the remedy Winter is creeping in I can taste the gravity When it gets cold I need someone to comfort me Every time I close my eyes I can see possibilities A different place A different life The dream that never sleeps When I feel blue I need someone to love me Not the kind of love That never grows Although it seems tough You've got to let it go And know how to ease your soul My summer skin is growing thin How I need the remedy Winter is creeping in I can taste the gravitySometimes I wonder If I'm under a spell I'm not doing well Just haven't been myself So I call up the doctor But the doctor's away There's nothing to say It just hasn't been my day Maybe I'll pick myself up And I'll be okay Get my love to stay Won't chase her away Wouldn't that be something Wouldn't that be something good I love to ponder I just can't decide There's never enough time I'm losing my mind We can get in the chopper And fly up the hill And never staying still Never cruising downhill When we get to the top Oh there's a mountain to climb We waste all our time It wouldn't be a crimeSky above Ground below It's all connected but I still feel so low On the quest Runnin' outta time I pass the test and now I'm just waitin' in line When it comes I won't say hello I won't say hello Pass me by On the stairs Turn your eyes away like you just don't care In your heart You know That you just been waiting to go toe to toe When I call You won't say hello No, no You won't say hello You won't say hello No, no You won't say helloSail the ocean blue I'm still in love with you And I'd like to open my heart I'd like for us to go to the start, yeah There are things that I would never say or do There are things that make me want to stick to you like glue All we do is move Away from memories that you wanna lose And I'd like to change who we are Why can't we be like movie stars There are things that I would never say or do There are things that make me want to stick to you like glue There are things that I would never say or do There are things that make me want to stick to you like glue And all we said before Feelings left at the door I come back for them later Write it on a little piece of paper And all I'll ever be Is swimming at the sea And darling why won't you be My sweet honeybee It's so complicated The way that we talk all night Then you hang up the phone When things don't seem right Overly outdated The way you never stay the night You want to keep me But you like the fight All this time I've waited Trying to tell wrong from right Keep my composure Waiting for the green light I just want to know you number, baby I just want to know where you live I want to cut straight to the answer Before I even know what the question is Take my heart and place it Inside a box for me Kick drum in the basement Perfect clarityWalking down the steps, the thought is in your head You try to trick yourself into feeling better Into feeling better Out on Newbury Street the sky is under your feet We will not, we will not accept defeat On Newbury Street You take one step at a time and everything's alright Your battle is your mind The cars come rolling by, forever Forever Out on Newbury Street the sky is under your feet We will not, we will not accept defeat On Newbury Street Of all the things I've done, deep inside my brain A hundred million questions popping in and out A big black cloud is gonna rain down on me todayEverything's in perfect balance Nothing that I say is challenged I am a neurosurgeon I may be the only person Who sees through the trap of reason I am a neurosurgeon Myriad of time and feeling Tower of discovery leaning Human is best when he's dreaming Not when the sun is beating Boson is kicking and screaming Life doesn't really need a meaning Everything's in perfect balance Nothing that I say is challenged I am a neurosurgeon I may be the only person Who sees through the trap of reason I am a neurosurgeon I'm always on the edge of life Not dying anymore I'm always on the edge of time Not counting anymore I can stop and change my mind No more dreaming at the door I'm always on the edge of life Not dying anymore
