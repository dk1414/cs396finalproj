There it is, plain and simple It destroyed itself without any of my slander This is the lunacy by which we kneel This is the doublespeak by which we kill This is the inertia that keeps tradition feared This is the absurdity by which we walk barefoot with shoes on our heads Ponder this to get nearer to nothing On top of the world, think about it There's nothing An unseasoned meal, monotone spirits Routine homily, nothing has never been clearer So kill a cat to keep logic at bay Then eat my body's finest and tell me how it tastes Is it nothing too Is it nothing too Does it stink like nothing Does it poison like nothing Was it right when It made the germ that Would have put you away before the vaccine Or was even that nearsighted Like the x ray That pinpointed the break And showed us the baby before it was too late Before the meat turns Toxic in our tubes Beware the fittest and the cycle That too often turns a stalemate Crucify our father Edison Sacrifice to the New Mysticism Smash the bulbs that lengthen the day Grind up the pills that took the fever away Behold  The monsoons and the river snakesLet's make a list So we can feel like we're accomplishing something So we can feel like we're working together Let's sit in a circle adding to the list As we move around the room one by one As you make a suggestion begin sternly—you take no shit—To give credence to your semi-constructive argument Tomorrow we'll wonder where this generation gets their priorities from Tomorrow my heart will skip a beat As it does every morning nine months of the year It has to do with this list Before the bells even ring Before the hair is even combed Will the approach ever change Or will it begin as I've said And end with a lighthearted twist To prove we're all adults It has to do with this list Which we'll put in our pockets To throw away at a later date It has to do with this list Which makes me feel more uncomfortable Than I've ever felt More apple pie than I've ever been We are not housewives, executives, or entrepreneurs We are teachers by trade, complainers by roleGoodbye child, you were born an American Though you'll never see its shores again Your formula was traded for a case knocked down at noon But I'll remember you As I kick aside the lychee pits As they drag their feet and never cease to stare As I carefully place my steps, watching kittens and phlegm On my way up to Delancey We are the psychos!The pathetic, the quitters, the all-time losers We are the rejects, the low-class, the unclean, the unkempt We are the cretins, uncivilized millions, second-rate human beings We are the heathens!We are the heathens!Though the origins change, they all pass through Hester Street We all have I would not have put my money on this horse, but it's won anyhow And sent its competitors into shock Yield to the Mongol hordes  Flee from the Celtic lore!Set sail for the foamy shores Because the heathens have won again The heathens have won again The heathens have won again If the question's asked when the kid is innocent And the answer's plain because you're not into it The line is drawn and your unenlightented son Will go forth with a wealth of misinformation His day has come if it's on the tube Put him in real time it'll do him good Make him realise the continuum between Ignorance and childhood Shield nothing Let him breathe, let him see Shield nothing Let him breathe, let him see When the kid can't sleep from the fear of the mystery Please keep in mind the good you've designed And when the bell rings at noon of no concern Try not to act surprised when the epithet cries"My mother lies My eyes aren't blind My life's a line"Though this is another disease And we cry when understanding is reached This is what fostering means It will all be over soonI took a dive down and in disbelief My goal was realized south in the sea A hundred feet from shore's infinity Potentially The reds weren't far off with the man machine When they took down the ceilings of the Sistine When they took all the icons off the wall That made them strong Heaven holds no reverence for the clock And denies the doctors probes and electric shocks Suggests theres more to learn beyond our block Let's keep that lot Can we trade the mystic for the scientific And keep the dogmas that will keep us with it I'd trade in all my trophies for the one The coral's got Let us mourn the dead as they deserve For all is lost to them and nothing less While we exempt the cycle it does them in We are their kin We keep the culture fresh with the ingredient That keeps the skin from smelling at the wake Can't it preserve the beating of my heart We hold the sparkThe mindset and drive of the Philadelphians Will forever remain a mystery to me But the framework has been irrevocably set'Cause no group is strong enough to conquer the rest We are the multi-facisted state Come gather bread for your plate And a car for every driveway And an impasse for your hate We are the bastard offspring Of generalissimos Mao and Mussolini We are the "save-my-own-ass" special interest strikers From Zion to Tirana Cause there's a loop in our scriptures That says every voice must be heard Don't point fingers at me ma'am It's you who finds this absurd Talk to the politicians Ayatollah Mulvaney Choose your diction well and you'll receive its pity And join us all on Capitol Hill As a quarter billion "Me!"'s sing democracy Well, we are the multi-facisted state Come gather bread for your plate And a car for every driveway And an impasse for your hateI'll meet you in the yellow my friend Probably not in the gray Despite hundreds of years of arguing Just as well, no one was listening anyhow Hopefully the next generation Will be too fine for the enemy to pick apart You are the glue between the two You are the glue between the two Octoquadroids won't fly in the next millennia So here we are pitted head to head In the arena that has historically separated us most And yet now it draws us together And you and I know Regardless of what the skeptics say That it is not submission or petiteness that draws us in You are the glue between the two You are the glue between the twoThe prairie yankee does the dance of the redskin to the songs of the Yangtze and he doesn't even know it My bluegrass fathers sing and dance like the Gaelics with the tools of the Senegalese and they never said thank you It wouldn't be so bad if they didn't change hands with a gun It wouldn't be so sad if the Old West was never won And when we learn about trade we really learn about swine I could pick up that banjo and everything would be just...C'mon  Cringe  Your skin is soiled 'cause your cousins have sinned Fire  Retire  And wipe your hands on your company's seams Cold  Gold  They built their fortress on the weakest of stones And no I don't feel, and no I don't feel guilt but maybe that just motivates me to...When Khublai Khan rode the railroad he got off at every stop When Jesus Joe lynched his neighbor that borrowed music never quit So I'm gonna kick it once again so you boys can get it through your heads My guitar's stained with blood from the head on up the neck Because some things were never said Some things were never said Some things were never saidBridgette Lin's got a twin And she's good and she's bad And you can't take her down But with fall comes her fall And this girl's been around Yes she's been around!It's a suffering, it's a suffering And I'm off the hook'Cause what I do despite my intentions Makes me the crook But what's written is written is written And she knows time is hell I'm not sure if the wind reflects my fate But I like the way it sounds
