I Beat up these other men who were bigger than me Was it cause I'm black and they were W-H-I-T-E Here I was walking down the block I seen these two big bikers standing by the biker's shop They seen it was me so to make theyself feel bigger One got bad, bold, pointed and called me a nigga I stuck my finger up, I said "His mother" and kept stepping His friend told his other friend "Hey Corky let's get him"I looked to my back, to my surprise One had a chain in his hand and the devil in his eye I said "I'm in trouble, let me think real quick"I looked down at the ground and got this big fat brick With no time to waste I put the brick in my hand And hit the biker til the chain fell out of his hand Then his friend Crowty said "Corky are you alright "But what he didn't know was he was in for a fight The right his his jaw, he fell on the floor The kid I hit with the brick before said "Don't hit him any more"I put my brick down, left him on the ground Everything was cool til the cops came around They said "You're under arrest for Assault 2 and 3"I laughed at the cop I said "Explain this to me"He said "You hit the man with a brick and punched another in the jaw And left the scene like nothing happened then they called the law"I laughed in his face, I said "This don't make sense"It was two against my black ass, this makes it self-defense He tried to grab me, so I pushed him on the floor And ran my black ass home and locked the living room door I did what any black kid would have did But to the cops of Suffolk County, I'm known as a fugitiveTales from the Crack Side Tales from the Crack Side Tales from the Crack Side I woke up in the morning on a regular day I knew my man named R would be around my way I brushed my hair, my teeth, suddenly I washed my face Then he came over my house with his drug base He kept saying if I take one hit of a pipe I write record to rhyme before the rest of the night I said, "R, I don't do drugs, or drugs are whack""And ain't that base drug like the drug, crack "He said "No Solo, see base is legit""Girls go for base, and everybody does it"He left off quick and left me, the base, and the pipe And I thought I write a record a rhyme before I reach night I said if that's true, but any case I couldn't wait to write my record after I smoke the base He left the crib, I heard the telephone It was my mom telling me to watch my sister till she gets home I hung up the phone, with no time to waste I put my sister in the kitchen so I could smoke the base It had a funny taste but it didn't taste bad I felt high That's when I got my pen and pad I wrote a rhyme that was funky I broke in a race'Cause the rhyme that I wrote tried to run off my page I said, "Stop rhyme"Then I grabbed the knife and cut the rhyme That I've seen running in my sight I got in mind was happy when I thought the rhyme was dead Till he swung and caught me square in the head I fell on my floor and The rhyme grabbed the knife And cut my little sister I thought it took her life She fell on the floor, blood covered the rug The rhyme was laughing to my surprise, I knew something was bugged I got on the phone to call the cops, "What should I do "You'd did the same thing if you was in my shoes As I started talking I seen the rhyme run by And hit me with a can of ravioli in my eye I fell on the floor, look, and when my vision cleared I looked around the house and see the rhyme disappeared I started to cry I said, "Oh, what would my mom say "That's when I heard a car pull up into the driveway She came in the house, she took a look at the place See my sister still bleeding, the knife and the base She said, "You cut your sister while you were smoking that shit"I said, "Mom, I didn't cut 'er, the rhyme did it"I knew this was the truth, mom thought it was a lie Some of y'all might even think it's just a Tale from the Crack SideYeah1992 You know what I'm sayin K-Solo back in effect1992 K-Solo steppin back in here Check it out Household Maid'92 Yo, Red You know what I'm sayin We ain't tell a story about all these girls we used to bang when we was young Brothers see, they don't believe us So ehm - I guess I'll start tellin...A story when I was young When I first got pussy Check it out It was in '77, well at least I think so Way before the people knew me as K-S-o-l-o We moved from Queens to Long Island and my moms had it made But mom was workin two jobs, she said, "Son, I want me a maid"We went to this agency that was on Broadway So mom could fill out the papers and see about a maid When we got there we seen a man who sat behind a desk He said, "I'm sorry, miss, but ain't too many good maids left But I'll show you some pictures of all the maids we got here"I looked and seen this maid who looked like Pam Grier I said, "Hey mom, let's get that maid, ooh, she looks like my teacher"Mom said, "Okay" and asked the man, "Can we meet her "He pressed a button, said a name, she was there in a flash Mom signed some papers, gave her money, and everything was done fast On the way home I could look and see she looked young And by the way she had me laughin, ooh, I knew she was fun But somethin was wrong, I couldn't figure it out Till one day me and the maid were alone in my house I was in my room readin a book She came inside my room naked and told me, "Kevin, take a look"]From her feet to her body, I stared at shock As I stared at her breast and her hairy provoc'She had a real bad body, I was put in a trance But snapped out of that trance when she unzipped my pants She wrapped her legs around me, she began to tease me Whispered in my ear, "Do you think you can please me "I said, "Yes", I couldn't fess And then the maid grabbed my young hand and put it on her grown chest She started seducin me, right there on the floor She said, "The better you get, you'll get more and more"Juices started movin fast, and she started goin"I'm comin, I'm comin", I said, "Stop, where are you goin "She paid me no mind, I guess she knew I was young I guess she said "It's for kids", but I was havin my fun As she went up and down, and side to side To make me slippery and wet as I went inside The maid moaned and groaned, moved my hips Blew in my ear, in my face and went and tongue-licked my lips I was only 11 and in the 6th grade No one believed that I made love to the household maidDrums of death Drums of death Drums of death Drums of

he drums of death and a mic In my world, he was marked as a burglar-uh My rhymes killed him so I'm marked as a murderer Took the mic to death  words defy And rappers pray for rap blood The sacrificial sacrifice, his soul is mine I break his mic, I say the hell with his rhymes I'm the emperor of anger, nothin's left As Solo gets stronger as the drums of deathYour man not a shooter Just like a nerd
