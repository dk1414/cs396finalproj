When your life goes round in circles Feel lost in time You keep searching for the answer Which you never find You've been holding on for too long Letting life pass you by Give it up, surrender Let it go this time Sent it out to the universe Let it fly away Hey, Hey, Hey Sent it out to the universe Whatever's meant to be, will be Yeah~yeah Just have faith in things you can see Open your heart There's no better feelin' than to be free Right where you are Everything that you need The world will provide Listen, hear your calling It's louder than your own mindWe could dim the light of day Watching colors drift away Beating like the sound of love Reflecting light back to the sun Listen as the silence plays Washing darkness from the shade Standing on the center stage Building castles in the rain Be my strength Show me the way Come to life Come and feel the sun Lift your hands, embrace Breaking waves of change Counting down to brighter days Consciously we elevate Blowing all the dust away Speaking truth to those who wait Be my strength Show me the way Come to life Come and feel the sun Lift your hands, embrace Breaking waves of change I can hear your calling From the distant plain'Cause in this moment I feel love I can feel you falling Miles from yesterday'Cause in this moment we are loved Nobody here is lonely Come to life Come and feel the sun Lift your hands, embrace Breaking waves of change Come to life Come and feel the sun Lift your hands, embrace Breaking waves of changeTake me on a ride inside your heart tonight Just you and me, take me to live inside the truth Sugar, I wanna taste the way you feel inside All through the night, forget about the time just close your eyes Sugar, always Though my heart, it breaks, baby Oh, let me be the one to come alone Let me just be such a deep surprise As the world you know begins to cry tonight Just let it be, if you wanna grow it all must die Sugar, we can come alive inside your dreams tonight Live to believe you are the only one for me Sugar, always Though my heart, it breaks, baby Oh, let me be the one to come alone Let me just be such a deep surpriseThere seems to be Somewhere far away from here A land in time where we found love I can't forget you Even if you say it to me"I don't know if I can make it"I know that you moved the fire And I know we'll find a way Even when the sun fades And clouds stay With you I know I'll find a way Even when I feel alone And nights grow cold With you I know I'll find a way Even when the sun fades And clouds stay With you I know I'll find a way Even when I feel alone And nights grow cold With you I know I'll find a wayCold air creeping in behind me As the darkness is crawling in My emotions has been in over Stained from the tears we shared Shook'n up and then swept away Nothing left just the memory stayed Thick scars are holding me tight Just wish I could sleep tonight Took a pill just to help the pain Swim for miles to get away Just to sink underneath the waves Catch my breath and begin to pray Let the numbness begin to fade Then I'll stand on my own again Let the wind pick away the silence Brave and sworn won't hold me from flying Free to be loved, now Free to be loved, now Sun shines but the Lord has helped me Subconsciously I prepare Courage and faith will guide me As the layers begin to shedWelcome to the beat baby Step into my room Tell me how you feel when sinking to the mood If you want to be the reason I can be the answer We can stand together, baby Walk the world together Let the rhythym take you where you want to go Listen to the melody let it take control If you wanna be the reason I can be the answer We can stand together, baby Walk the world forever I want to feel you I want to taste the world we've found I want to feel you I want to breathe you in right now Give yourself to me, baby Listen to a song Let the music take us as we move along If you wanna be the reason I can be the answer We can stand together, baby Walk the world together I want to feel you I want to taste the world we've found I want to feel you I want to breathe you in right now I want to feel you I want to taste the world we've
