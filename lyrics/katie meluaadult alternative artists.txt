There are nine million bicycles in Beijing That's a fact It's a thing we can't deny Like the fact that I will love you till I die We are twelve billion light years from the edge That's a guess No one can ever say it's true But I know that I will always be with you I'm warmed by the fire of your love everyday So don't call me a liar Just believe everything that I say There are six billion people in the world More or less, and it makes me feel quite small But you're the one I love the most of all We're high on the wire With the world in our sight And I'll never tire Of the love that you give me every nightBusy man, where am I on your list You're so full of big ideas Do you think that we can coexist Will we be a pair in twenty years If all your dreams were on fire Which one would you save When it comes down to the wire Should I be afraid Should I be afraid I don't need the world to be content All I'll ever need is you Time alone with you is time well spent For me that simple dream will more than do If all your dreams were on fire Which one would you save When it comes down to the wire Should I be afraid Should I be afraid You're beautiful so silently It lies beneath a shade of blue It struck me so violently When I looked at you But others pass; they never pause To feel that magic in your hand To me, you're like a wild rose They never understand why I cried for you, and the sky cried for you And when you went, I became a hopeless drifter But this life was not for you though I learned from you That beauty need only be a whisper I'll cross the sea For a different world With your treasure, a secret For me to hold In many years they may forget This love of ours or that we met They may not know how much you meant To meHow can I think I'm standing strong Yet feel the air beneath my feet How can happiness feel so wrong How can misery feel so sweet How can you let me watch you sleep Then break my dreams the way you do How can I have got in so deep Why did I fall in love with you This is the closest thing to crazy I have ever been Feeling twenty-two, acting seventeen This is the nearest thing to crazy I have ever known I was never crazy on my own And now I know that there's a link between the two Being close to craziness and being close to you How can you make me fall apart Then break my fall with loving lies It's so easy to break a heart It's so easy to close your eyes How can you treat me like a child Yet like a child I yearn for you How can anyone feel so wild How can anyone feel so blue She is like the lady down the road Or just the woman up the street Like any mother you may know To me, she is the one who had it planned To lead us all to Wonderland She always wanted us to go And she said Don't ever be lonely Remember, I'll always care Wherever you may be Remember I will be there And like another lady that we know She has a smile so bright and sweet And hair as white as driven snow Though life is never easy day to day She has a very special way To make us smile when we are low And she says Don't ever be lonely Remember, I'll always care Wherever you may be Remember I will be thereHere I go out to sea again The sunshine fills my hair And dreams hang in the air Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes You know it feels unfair There's magic everywhere Look at me standing Here on my own again Up straight in the sunshine No need to run and hide It's a wonderful wonderful life No need to laugh or cry It's a wonderful wonderful life The sun's in your eyes The heat is in your hair They seem to hate you because you're there And I need a friend Oh I need a friend to make me happy Not stand here on my own Look at me standing Here on my own again Up straight in the sunshine No need to run and hide It's a wonderful wonderful life No need to laugh or cry It's a wonderful wonderful lifeIf you're a cowboy I would trail you If you're a piece of wood I'd nail you to the floor If you're a sailboat I would sail you to the shore If you're a river I would swim you If you're a house I would live in you all my days If you're a preacher I'd begin to change my ways Sometimes I believe in fate But the chances we create Always seem to ring more true You took a chance on loving me I took a chance on loving you If I was in jail I know you'd spring me If I was a telephone you'd ring me all day long If was in pain I know you'd sing me soothing songs Sometimes I believe in fate But the chances we create Always seem to ring more true You took a chance on loving me I took a chance on loving you If I was hungry you would feed me If I was in darkness you would lead me to the light If I was a book I know you'd read me every nightI'd love to kill you with a kiss I'd like to strike you down with bliss I'd like to tie you up in knots Until your heart stops I'd love to kill you with a glance I'd like to put you in a trance I'd like to drug you with my scent And use you in the moment Ooh I'd love to kill you as you eat The pleasure would taste so sweet I'd like to open up your skin And wander there within I'd love to kill you by a stream Where no one can hear my baby scream And then I'd run away and be free The sweetest victory OohIf a black man is racist, is it okay If it's the white man's racism that made him that way Because the bully's the victim they say By some sense they're all the same'Cause the line between wrong and right Is the width of a thread from a spider's web The piano keys are black and white But they sound like a million colors in your mind I could tell you to go to war Or I could march for peace and fighting no more How do I know which is right And I hope he does when he sends you to fight'Cause the line between wrong and right Is the width of a thread from a spider's web The piano keys are black and white But they sound like a million colors in your mind Should we act on a play Or should we chase the moments away Should we live, should we give Remember forever the guns and the feathers in time'Cause the line between wrong and right Is the width of a thread from a spider's web The piano keys are black and white But they sound like a million colors in your mind The piano keys are black and white But they sound like a million colors in your mindFirst of all must go Your scent upon my pillow And then I'll say goodbye To your whispers in my dreams And then our lips will part In my mind and in my heart'Cause your kiss Went deeper than my skin Piece by piece Is how I'll let go of you Kiss by kiss Will leave my mind one at a time One at a time First of all must fly My dreams of you and I There's no point in holding on to those And then our ties will break For your and my own sake Just remember This is what you chose Piece by piece Is how I'll let go of you Kiss by kiss Will leave my mind one at a time One at a time I'll shed like skin Our memories of lazy days And fade away the shadow of your face Piece by piece Is how I'll let go of you Kiss by kiss Will leave my mind one at a time One at a time, one at a time
