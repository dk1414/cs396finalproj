There's an old man sitting next to me Making love to his tonic and gin He says, “Son, can you play me a memory I'm not really sure how it goes But it's sad, and it's sweet, and I knew it complete When I wore a younger man's clothes”La, la-la, di-dee-da La-la di-dee-da da-dum Sing us a song, you're the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well, we're all in the mood for a melody And you've got us

looking for a downtown man That's what I am And when she knows what she wants from her time And when she wakes up and makes up her mind She'll see I'm not so tough Just because I'm in love with an Uptown girl You know I've seen her in her uptown world She's getting tired of her high class toys And all the presents from her uptown boys She's got a choiceDon't go changing to try and please me You never let me down before, mm And don't imagine you're too familiar And I don't see you anymore I would not leave you in times of trouble We never could have come this far, mm I took the good times, I'll take the bad times I take you just the way you are Don't go trying some new fashion Don't change the color of your hair, mm You always have my unspoken passion Although I might not seem to care I don't want clever conversation Never want to work that hard, mm I just want someone that I can talk to I want you just the way you are Need to know that you will always be The same old someone that I

can wound with her eyes And she can ruin your faith with her casual lies And she only reveals What she wants you to see She hides like a child But she's always a woman to me She can lead you to love She can take you or leave you She can ask for the truth But she'll never believe you And she'll take what you give her As long as it's free Yeah, she steals like a thief But she's always a woman to me Oh, she takes care of herself She can wait if she wants She's ahead of her time Oh, and she never gives out And she never gives in She just changes her mindDum dum dum Whoa, oh, oh, oh For the longest time Whoa, oh, oh For the longest time If you said goodbye to me tonight There would still be music left to write What else could I do I'm so inspired by you That hasn't happened for the longest time Once I thought my innocence was gone Now I know that happiness goes on That's where you found me When you put your arms around me I haven't been there for the longest time Whoa, oh, oh, oh For the longest time Whoa, oh, oh For the longestCome out Virginia, don't let me wait You Catholic girls start much too late Aw, but sooner or later, it comes down to fate I might as well be the one Well, they showed you a statue, told you to pray They built you a temple and locked you away Aw, but they never told you the price that you pay For things that you might have done Well, only the good die young That's what I said Only the good die young Only the good die young You might-a heard I run with a dangerous crowd We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud We might be laughing a bit too loud Aw, but that never hurt no one So come on Virginia, show me a sign Send up a signal, I'll throw you the line The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind Never lets in the sun Darling, only the good die young Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah I tell ya, only the good die young Only the good die young You got a nice white dress And a party on your confirmation You got a brand new soul Mmm, and a cross of gold But Virginia they didn't give you Quite enough information You didn't count on me When you were counting on your rosary They say there's a heaven for those who will wait Some say it's better, but I say it ain't I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints The sinners are much more fun You know that only the good die young Oh, baby I tell ya, only the good die young Only the good die youngA bottle of white, a bottle of red Perhaps a bottle of rosé instead We'll get a table near the street In our old familiar place You and I, face to face, mmm A bottle of red, a bottle of white It all depends upon your appetite I'll meet you any time you want In our Italian restaurant Things are okay with me these days Got a good job, got a good office Got a new wife, got a new life And the family is fine Oh, lost touch long ago You lost weight, I did not know You could ever look so nice After so much time You remember those days Hanging out at the Village Green Engineer boots, leather jackets and tight blue jeans Oh, you drop a dime in the box Play the song about New Orleans Cold beer, hot lights My sweet romantic teenage nights
