what you did with the place, it looks gorgeous Cityscape where the blood of good men courses And the dreamers are bull trapped in porcelain Take a knee to the gods and get horse shit Wanna live for the thrill  They'll arrange it Got a bevy of imps to spit hatred Shit'll get in your head and cause panic Have you desperately begging to get famous Get your dignity dirty and left orphaned Sanity on the fringe of distorted Who are they to just take shit and hoard it Who am I that I don't get my portion The most impressionable minds Get molested and informed by manipulating forces Don't fret, little man, don't cry They can never take the energy inside you were born with Knowing that, understand you could never be poor You already won the war, you were born rich You can only take the energy you had Going back to the realm or the home where your lord is Whoever, whatever that lord is Couldn't give a fuck if you ever made fortunes Fuck anyone ever tryin' to run that bum shit Send 'em to the flames where the orcs live Them and the lost minds thinking they're smarter than us Don't understand love's importance And we can weaponize that, bring 'em back to the truth Where the ashes and dust got formed in
