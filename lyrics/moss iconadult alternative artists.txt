I'm back, Formosa Your gardens and bridges green with shit came running Your gardens and bridges, green as shit I'll remember you Well, all things considered, I do!I dreamt about that house last night You know the black lady told me not to make her sons jealous I didn't have any of the guns and fucking firetrucks!Sitting in the back of her car, it was raining that night I had sat in the back and then, fuckin', it was like I was melting or something I couldn't even talk I couldn't even make it out, y'know What do I have I wonder if you remember me I had long blonde hair, and a stormy smile In fact, I remember a photograph of me and you Sitting on a bench with my sister She was there too I'm back, Sheridan Yellow, red, white and blue Firemen came runningNow I've realized I've seen a body divine Beckoning to me to come with mine Now I've realized I've seen a body divine Beckoning to me to come with mine Beckoning and its eyes lies away in sanctuary Beckoning and its eyes lies away in sanctuary And I How was I to know It didn't mean goodbye It meant "please, don't let me go"Beckoning its eyes lies away in sanctuary Beckoning and its eyes lies away, how was I to know It meant please don't let me go It meant please don't let me go Lyburnum the eyes of the mind Calling to make it real and tangible The divine invisibility Pulling its eyes it lies away in sanctuary Pulling its eyes it lies away in sanctuary is not mine Lyburnum cover me Lyburnum to sink with you to be pulled in Lord I'm wits end On a road with selfish people in bad time and tide A cross of swords and a wreath of dead lilies in a pit archive Constitution will power play and man down dumb has triedWe could be from the same mother You know, maybe we are brothers I don't think that he said anything, although it was obviously said And strongly, wise God, the strength you have You know I always watch you, anticipate you We're the same when it gets down to "it"Though I'm not sure what "it" is We're the same when it gets down to "it"Respect is more than envy Respect is more than jealousy It's respect I respect you The mirror Strength you have Strength you have Strength comes with knowledge We could be from the same mother You know, maybe we are brothers I don't think that he said anything, although it was obviously said And strongly And wiselyToday there was a stream where a walker walked alone Whistling a tune that drifted up through a tree And stirred a bird up before it was heard by a girl Today there was a vision Of a house burning on a television In a room inside an eye  In a head topped by a brown curl A telephone ring in the middle of the night Was said to cause fright in a dark house lived in by a family of four Today is almost tomorrow and, if I think, not quite yesterday But all this ahead, that sees not Would at the foot of its bed And tomorrow is not quite yesterday Tomorrow's not quite yesterday Last time I saw you, you didn't have brown hair Now my footfalls don't echo in your halls no more And creeping up the stairs to your room Stick close I'd stay to the walls Stick so close to the wall that the stairs don't creak at all And I think I would know!Last time I heard you at the table, I could feel that I was a fear and a ghost And now all my words have fears of mine alone Terradina Then came the many ways and vistas of God Machines, webs, and spiders Pulling up thousands of orange stakes with you God is a life The son of God out does himself For he knew to I'm no use without the truth Machines, webs, and spiders Put rocks in the gas tank and fucked up the Cause God is a life He's a vampire Feeding off of itself And I guess that's why it's  now It's a cycle Snake eating tail It's a cycle, snake eating tail I thought it meant divided, I know it does I thought it meant divided, I know it does It was only a misunderstanding of words I thought it meant divided, I know it does That doesn't mean that it was not goodLove You can't define the word Hate Loving comes too late Jealousy It's in between the two Resentment Something that fills me and you Cloud heavy with rain can't stop the rain Just utilizing my pain can't stop my pain I wish I wish that I could see what's going bad with me And I wish that you could know Know what to do with love to show When I think of you I think of love and hate of things never to be What I see in you I see love and hate in things I wish could be Just at times I wish you could see love and hate in me When individuality cannot exist It doesn't exist but not for jealousy And when consciously you told me, "It doesn't exist, it can never be"Take my life and look at it You can feel, you can Drop my wine spill the spit out Upon the floor Look at me, stand up you fool Let the lion roar To shine the boot that walks on the road that leads to here To stop and sit and think about the way things might have been To waste your fucking time you fool This is not a joke Take my life and look at it You can't feel, you can Drop my wine, break vines that grow out on the lawn Look at me, give up you fool this joke won't last long To smother the past with blatant lies It can't work in here To forget, release, to drop, to let Sorry man, I'm still here Leave me alone, leave me alone, shut up, they'll think you're crazy Took his life and held it high is what they did Drop back in - I tried, just one if I'd have hid Look at him, you smile, seven pounds, four ounces To take this life The worst is over, you're thinking about the mother on that last one, aren't you Don't give up the ghost To take his life Don't give up the ghost, don't take his life Don't give up the ghost, don't take his lifeAltar recieve this container, body That is laid before you, bare Void, your will is to take and to liberate with the freedom of this night's air Void, your will is to take through this altar And to liberate with the freedom of this night's air Altar recieve me Holy and given a will I will fall Void recieve me I am with only the will to follow Country rise Altar, you rise up this living yellow; frowning; breathing stone Altar you rise up my father, down past ankle and from his rib and from his bone Altar recieve me Holy, a being of your will, I will fall Void recieve me Holy, becoming your projection, I will to follow As after its recession there is a deepness to the tide As after a life, a spirit's tangibility died Altar, recieve this spatial man Void, your all-consuming willA thousand red warriors reluctantly ordered to begin A charge that lead to slaughter amid chaotic blackened din On a desert plain It is lonely at this stop here with the low arms of light creeping in We delivered the kiss of death and it was well received It’s lonely and there’s no where to go except down It’s lonely and there’s no place to go except down The desert is alone and I’ve no face to show this dawn Just heavy, cold light on these eyes, this sorry excuse for eyes Dear, I dressed up a cactus as a clown and on his spiny face I painted a frown His whiskers brush my cheek, I plant the kiss of death, and my lip bleeds It is lonely and the only direction I know is down It is lonely and the only place I know is down The desert is home for a dusty circus clown“The moth balls,” I told you “such a sorry excuse for eyes.”Mom, this is such a sorry excuse for eyes On a desert plain where I now stand rubbing dusty eyes With the company of a deaf friend, whose beginnings I despise On a desert plain Take what you can, but the reflections scare the shit out of me Take what you can when you can, why can't I kick the can There’s a pebble inside and it rattles hopelessly to the empty desert dawn Oh, but it was well received It was well received We were well received, we were well received, really We were well received Over there, we were well received ReallySing along Sing along The earth cliffs All of them Sing strong, you are the color You are the sound, you are the color You are the sound that you see Sing along The earth cliffs All of them Sing strong, you are the color You are the sound that you see Expose bank Expose bank Eroded Cyclic rivulet gravitation, pulling Downstream Bound Soil cloud dripped and ripped Dripped and ripped Expose bank Eroded through cyclic rivulet gravitation, pulling Downstream Bound Soil cloud dripped then ripped Dripped then ripped Dripped then ripped Along and in between the large rocks That still are holding fast Against the soft water And the incessant pull against the soft water And the incessant pull Sing along Sing along The earth
