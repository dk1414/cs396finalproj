Hello Dan, it's Joe here I hope you're keeping well It's the 21st of December And now they're ringing the last bells If I get good behaviour I'll be out of here by July Won't you kiss my kids on Christmas Day Please don't let 'em cry for me I guess the brothers are driving down from Queensland And Stella's flying in from the coast They say it's gonna be a hundred degrees, even more maybe But that won't stop the roast Who's gonna make the gravy now I bet it won't taste the same Just add flour, salt, a little red wine And don't forget a dollop of tomato sauce For sweetness and that extra tang And give my love to Angus, and to Frank and Dolly Tell 'em all I'm sorry, I screwed up this time And look after Rita, I'll be thinking of her Early Christmas morning when I'm standing in lineGather 'round, people, I'll tell you a story An eight-year long story of power and pride British Lord Vestey and Vincent Lingiari Were opposite men on opposite sides Vestey was fat, with money and muscle Beef was his business, broad was his door Vincent was lean and spoke very little He had no bank balance, hard dirt was his floor From little things, big things grow From little things, big things grow Gurindji were working for nothing but rations Where once they had gathered the wealth of the land And daily, the pressure got tighter and tighter Gurindji decided they must make a stand They picked up their swags and started off walking At Wattie Creek, they sat themselves down Now, it don't sound like much, but it sure got tongues talking Back at the homestead and then in the town From little things, big things grow From little things, big things growWelcome, strangers, to the show I'm the one who should be lying low Saw the knives out, turned my back Heard the train coming, stayed right on that track In the middle, in the middle In the middle of a dream I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings I've done all the dumb things Caught the fever, heard the tune Thought I loved her, hung my heart on the moon Started howling, made no sense Thought my friends would rush to my defence In the middle, in the middle In the middle of a dream I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings I've done all the dumb thingsThey got married early, never had no money Then when he got laid off, they really hit the skids He started up his drinking, then they started fighting He took it pretty badly, she took both the kids She said, "I'm not standing by to watch you slowly die So watch me walking out the door Out the door, out the door"She said, "Shove it, Jack, I'm walking out your fucking door"She went to her brother's, got a little bar work He went to the buttery, he stayed about a year Then he wrote a letter, and said, "I want to see ya"She thought he sounded better, she sent him up the fare He was riding through the cane in the pouring rain On Olympic to her door To her door, to her door To her door, to her doorFirewood and candles on a winter Friday night Waiting for my sweetheart, I wanna set the scene just right Wine in the bottles, paella cooking in the pan Elvis on the stereo, I'm a man with a plan Firewood and candles, giving off a lovely light And when she knocks upon my door, I hope she's got an appetite We're gonna shut out the world, forget about the T V news Firewood and candles, tonight, they're gonna see us through We're gonna talk a little, we're gonna kiss a little And then some more, a whole lot more I'm gonna show her I love her Below and above her and a whole lot more Firewood and candles, making shadows on the wall Is that the gods come to Earth, or a mule kicking in our stall Making all these memories, forever gonna keep us warm When firewood and candles disappear in the storm Yeah, we talk a little, we kiss a little And then some more, a whole lot more Oh, she knows I love her Below and above her and a whole lot moreOn a crowded beach in a distant time At the height of summer, see a boy of five At the water's edge, so nimble and free Jumping over the ripples, looking way out to sea Now a man comes up from amongst the throng Takes the young boy's hand and his hand is strong And the child feels safe, yeah, the child feels brave As he's carried in those arms up and over the waves Deeper water Deeper water Deeper water Is calling him on Let's move forward now and the child's seventeen With a girl in the back seat, tugging at his jeans And she knows what she wants, she guides with her hand As a voice cries inside him, "I'm a man, I'm a man!"Deeper water Deeper water Deeper water Is calling him onI'm high on the hill, looking over the bridge to the M CG And way up on high, the clock on the silo says eleven degrees I remember I remember I'm breathing today, the month of May, all the burning leaves I'm not hearing a sound, my feet don't even touch the ground I remember I remember I go leaps and bounds I go leaps and bounds Down past the river and across the playing fields The fields all empty, only for the burning leaves I remember I remember I go leaps and bounds I go leaps and boundsSydney, 1926: this is the story of a man Just a kid in from the sticks, just a kid with a plan St George took a gamble, played him in first grade Pretty soon that young man showed them how to flash the blade And at the age of nineteen, he was playing for the state From Adelaide to Brisbane, the runs did not abate He hit 'em hard, he hit 'em straight He was more than just a batsman He was something like a tide More than just one man He could take on any side They always came for Bradman'Cause fortune used to hide In the palm of his hands In the palm of his hands A team came out from England Wally Hammond wore his felt hat like a chief All through the summer of '28â€“'29 They gave the green-caps no relief Some reputations came to grief They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn And in the hour of greatest slaughter The great avenger is being born But who then could have seen the shape of things to come In Bradman's first Test, he went for eighteen and for one They dropped him like a gun Now big Maurice Tate was the trickiest of them all And a man with a wisecracking habit But there's one crack that won't stop ringing in his ears"Hey, Whitey  That's my rabbit"Bradman never forgot itThe wisteria on the back veranda is still blooming And all the great aunts are either insane or dead Kensington Road runs straight for a while before turning We lived on the bend, it was there I was raised and fed Counting and running as I go Down past the hedges all in a row In Adelaide, Adelaide Adelaide, Adelaide Dad's hands used to shake, but I never knew he was dying I was thirteen, I never dreamed he could fall And all the great aunts were red in the eyes from crying I rang the bells, I never felt nothing at all All the king's horses, all the king's men Cannot bring him back again Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-doFrom St Kilda to Kings Cross Is thirteen hours on a bus I pressed my face against the glass And watched the white lines rushing past And all around me felt like all inside me And my body left me And my soul went running Have you ever seen Kings Cross When the rain is falling soft I came in on the evening bus From Oxford Street, I cut across And if the rain don't fall too hard Everything shines just like a postcard Everything goes on just the same Fair-weather friends are the hungriest friends I keep my mouth well shut, I cross their open hands I want to see the sun go down From St Kilda Esplanade Where the beach needs reconstruction Where the palm trees have it hard I'd give you all of Sydney Harbour All that land, and all that water For that one sweet promenade I'd give you all of Sydney Harbour All that land, and all that water For that one sweet promenade
