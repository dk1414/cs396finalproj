Beginning in the dawn Well, I vow to no man And still serve everyone'Cause this is in the doing And this is how it’s done I will be alright If I should fall I will be alright When the sirens call I will be alright If I could see That I was born to be freeI had with you tonight my dove Should the world push and shove Don't beg for mercy from my love, oh But if, if any man That comes after me If any man comes after me Ah, ah, ah Cigarettes and raven hair A surrender every care But child in my soul scares me But if, if any man Coming after me If any man Is coming after me If any man Coming
