When I’m alone in my room Sometimes I stare at the wall And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call Telling me I need a boy who’s as sweet as a dove For the first time in my life, I see I need love There I was giggling about the games that I had played with many hearts And I’m not sayin' no names Then the thought occurred, tear drops made my eyes burn As I said to myself: when am I gonna learn I can feel it inside, I can’t explain how it feels All I know is that I’ll never dish another raw deal Playin' make believe, pretending that I’m true Holding in my laugh just to say that I love you Saying amour, kissing you on the ear Whispering I love you and I’ll always be here Although I always reminisce, I can't believe that I found A desire for true love floating around Inside my soul, because my soul is cold One half of me deserves to be this way til I’m old But the other half needs affection and joy And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy I need love Got my mind made up, got my mind made up Got my mind made up I need love Got my mind made up I’m a lady Got my mind made up I need love Got my mind made up, Got my mind made up Got my mind made up I need love Got my mind made up I’m a lady Got My mind made upMy ladies who got their own cash, know how to swing their hips fast Back and forth to the beat, don't sleep girl Show ‘em how you work that ass My fellas who keep that shit on lock And know how to keep their lady rocked Fuck a two-step,

wall'Cause I can't hear you whine Fingers and my feet are selling cheap Just to keep you mine You're so big, one step ahead Said less than zero No one's hero better left for dead No one to blame but me for this mess I made is what you said Shame on me, shame on me I believed this was so easy No one sees you're so pleased To put the blame on me, it's all on me I can't stay on the tracks Discipline is what we lack But you ain't stopping me again Don't know if you understand You made me drop, I have to end it Hollywood, don't know where to go Little girl abandoned, left me stranded And now I'm on my own It feels so fake but looks so real Feed the devil, make a deal Brought us in, how does it feel To know you sold your soul My baby, he left me high and dry Can't be the man for me Said he can't tell me why He told me that he loves me But he's gotta be alone He doesn't need me anymore Wants to do it on his own He said he doesn't wanna run But we hold each other back I love him so hard I would fall off track DJ, play that song a little louder I gotta, gotta get him outta my head Gotta dance the pain away Can't go to sleep just yet DJ, can't you play a little harder I gotta, gotta get farther outta the zone I need the beat for release I can't get it on my own How could he say that He loves me unconditionally But still put so many rules And restrictions on me He told me, "No one's gonna love you As much as I do But I can't be the man That you need me to."He just couldn't hold my hand But he couldn't let me go Was afraid that I found someone That loves me more So he keeps me in his trap While he walks out the gate He knows he's gonna come back He knows that it's too lateSo ambitious baby always on the road Too relentless i can't ever let it go Give it up, sit down and do what you're told So wrong ain't i the coldest bitch you know They take your number but they never call Don't want nothing but you take it all Feel my resistance got a grip on tight Using my legs because my head ain't right Leaving you behind Im leaving you behind Leaving you behind I heard your secret and it's just to sweet to keep Im tellin everybody you can't take the heat Dont it sting Salt got in there deep And i can't help you cuz im just so fuckin mean Go 'head and try me like you wish you could You're too small for how tall i stood Dont it hurt to know you ain't that tough hot stuff It ain't enough and now nobody gives a fuck ChorusWhat you looking at Do I got something in my eye Do I got shit up on my face or did my hair catch on fire Cause you really really staring am I
