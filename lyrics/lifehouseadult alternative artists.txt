What day is it  And in what month This clock never seemed so alive I can't keep up and I can't back down I've been losing so much time'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do Nothing to lose And it's you and me and all other people And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right I'm tripping on words You've got my head spinning I don't know where to go from here'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do Nothing to prove And it's you and me and all other people And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you There's something about you now I can't quite figure out Everything she does is beautiful Everything she does is rightFind me here And speak to me I want to feel you I need to hear you You are the light That's leading me To the place Where I find peace again You are the strength That keeps me walking You are the hope That keeps me trusting You are the light To my soul You are my purpose You're everything How can I stand here with you And not be moved by you Would you tell me How could it be Any better than this YeahLook around There's no one but you and me Right here and now The way it was meant to be There's a smile on my face Knowing that together everything that's in our way We're better than alright Walking between the raindrops Riding the aftershock beside you Off into the sunset Living like there's nothing left to lose Chasing after gold mines Crossing the fine lines we knew Hold on and take a breath I'll be here every step Walking between the raindrops with you Take me now The world's such a crazy place When the walls come down You'll know I'm here to stay There's nothing I would change Knowing that together everything that's in our way We're better than alrightEvery time I see your face My heart takes off on a high speed chase Now don't be scared, it's only love Baby, that we're falling in I can't wait 'til tomorrow This feeling has swallowed me whole And I know that I've lost control This heart that I have followed Has left me so hollow That was then, this is now Yeah, you have changed everything Every time I see your face My heart takes off on a high speed chase Now don't be scared, it's only love That we're falling in I would never do you wrong Or let you down or lead you on Don't look down, it's only love Baby, that we're falling inI was only looking for a shortcut home But it's complicated, so complicated Somewhere in this city is a road I know Where we could make it but maybe there's no making it now Too long we've been denying, now we're both tired of trying We hit a wall and we can't get over it Nothing to relive, it's water under the bridge You said it, I get it, I guess it is what it is I was only trying to bury the pain But I made you cry and I can't stop the crying Was only trying to save me but I lost you again Now there's only lying, wish I could say it's only me Here it comes, ready or not We both found out it's not how we thought That it would be How it would be If the time could turn us around What was once lost may be found For you and me For you and meThe broken clock is a comfort, it helps me sleep tonight Maybe it can stop tomorrow from stealing all my time I am here still waiting though I still have my doubts I am damaged at best, like you've already figured out I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing With a broken heart that's still beating In the pain, there is healing In your name I find meaning So I'm holding on, I'm holding on, I'm holding on I'm barely holding on to you The broken locks were a warning you got inside my head I tried my best to be guarded, I'm an open book instead I still see your reflection inside of my eyes That are looking for a purpose, they're still looking for life I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing With a broken heart that's still beating In the pain, is there healing In your name I find meaningHalfway gone, I'm halfway gone You were always hard to hold So letting go ain't easy I'm hanging on but growing cold While my mind is leaving Talk, talk is cheap Give me your word you can keep Because I'm halfway gone, and I'm on my way And I'm feeling, feeling, feeling this way Because you're halfway in, but don't take too long Because I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone Halfway gone, I'm halfway gone You got one foot out the door And choking on the other Always think there's something more Is just around the corner Talk, talk is cheap Give me your word you can keep Because I'm halfway gone, and I'm on my way And I'm feeling, feeling, feeling this way Because you're halfway in, but don't take too long Because I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone Halfway gone, I'm halfway goneFear in your eyes like you’re lookin' for a window For the wide open skies wonderin' where do I begin though If you knew how bright you shine Do you think it might change your mind The clouds are on fire, and they’re telling you something that they know You shine like gold You shine like gold Remember what you said when you drove all night from Memphis That the headlights of your eyes were running from the tempest Well the dawn broke through the black When you’re laughin', lookin' back No matter how dark, the morning comes up relentless You shine like gold You shine like gold And your soul was born to shine Like a spark In the night In the dark, it hides your glowIf shame had a face, I think it would kind of look like mine If it had a home, would it be my eyes Would you believe me if I said I'm tired of this Well, here we go now, one more time I tried to climb your steps, I tried to chase you down I tried to see how low I could get down to the ground I tried to earn my way, I tried to tame this mind You better believe that I tried to beat this So when will this end  It goes on and on Over and over and over again Keep spinning around, I know that it won't stop Until I step down from this for good I never thought I'd end up here Never thought I'd be standing where I am I guess I kind of thought it would be easier than this I guess I was wrong now, one more time I tried to climb your steps, I tried to chase you down I tried to see how low I could get down to the ground I tried to earn my way, I tried to tame this mind You better believe that I tried to beat this
