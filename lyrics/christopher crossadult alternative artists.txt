Well, it's not far down to paradise At least it's not for me And if the wind is right you can sail away And find tranquility Oh, the canvas can do miracles Just you wait and see Believe me It's not far to never never land No reason to pretend And if the wind is right you can find the joy Of innocence again Oh, the canvas can do miracles Just you wait and see Believe me Sailing Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be Just a dream and the wind to carry me Soon I will be freeOnce in your life you find her Someone that turns your heart around And next thing you know you're closing down the town Wake up and it's still with you Even though you left her way 'cross town Wondering to yourself, "Hey, what've I found "When you get caught between the moon and New York City I know it's crazy, but it's true If you get caught between the moon and New York City The best that you can do The best that you can do Is fall in love Arthur, he does as he pleases All of his life, his master's toys Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy Living his life one day at a time And showing himself a pretty good time Laughing about the way they want him to be When you get caught between the moon and New York City I know it's crazy, but it's true If you get caught between the moon and New York City The best that you can do The best that you can do Is fall in loveIt is the night My body's weak I'm on the run No time to sleep I've got to ride Ride like the wind To be free again And I've got such a long way to go To make it to the border of Mexico So I'll ride like the wind Ride like the wind I was born the son of a lawless man Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand Lived nine lives Gunned down ten Gonna ride like the wind And I've got such a long way to go To make it to the border of Mexico So I'll ride like the wind Ride like the windHey Laura, Laura Hey Laura, Laura Every once in a while I'd see her smile And she'd turn my day around A girl with those eyes could stare through the lies And see what your heart was saying Think of Laura But laugh don't cry I know she'd want it that way When you think of Laura Laugh don't cry I know she'd want it that way A friend of a friend A friend 'til the end That's the kind of girl she was Taken away so young Taken away without a warningI know I know what's on your mind And I know it gets tough sometimes But you can give it one more try Find a reason why You should pick it up Oooh, and try it again Cause it's all right, I think we're gonna make it I think it might just work out this time It's all right, I think we're gonna make it I think it might work out fine this time It's all right, I think we're gonna make it I think it might just work out Cause it's not too late for that Too late for me I know I've been hurt before And I know I really shouldn't give any more But this time This time things seem just a little different And when I look in your eyes You know I can see that it's true And I hear you sayIt was good for me It was good for you Now nothing either of us can say or do Can change the way you feel tonight Sometimes love just slips out of sight Just one thing before you go Just one thing that you've got to know No one will ever touch me that way The way that you did that very first day And I'll Never be the same without you here I'll live alone Hide myself behind my tears No I'll Never be the same without your love I'll live alone Try so hard to rise above The years go by There's always someone new To try and help me forget about you Time and again it does me no good Love never feels the way that it shouldI was a man Who always played around in love So quick to take But so afraid to give enough But now I've found the one And heaven will only know What only my eyes can say And time can't take away I was a girl Who trusted no one with my heart And the dreams that young girls dream Were just vanishing in the dark But now I've found the one And heaven will only know What only my eyes can say They say That I will  take you  forever And there will never be anyone else In my heart but you And I will take you forever And there will never be anyone else but you Anyone else but youWhat do you think about love Is it a game to be played To be torn and lost in the wilderness To be lost And lonely after all What do you think about love Is it a way to be saved To feel the warmth of another love Just to be lost And lonely after all I really don't know anymore I really can't say I really don't know anymore I'm just that way What do you think about love Is it a game to be played To keep your heart and have never loved To be lost And lonely after all What do you think about love Is it a way to be saved To give up your heart to another love To be lost And lonely after allI never had anything happen so fast Took one look and I shattered like glass I guess I let it show 'cause your smile Told me you knew That you're everything I ever wanted at once There's no holding this heart When it knows what it wants And I never wanted anything more than to know you I was swept away No one in the world but you and I Gotta find a way To make you feel the way that I do I was swept away Without a warning Like night when the morning begins the day I was swept away And so it begins This journey of love The summer wind carries us to places all our own The words of a look The language of touch The way that you want me means so much And I never wanted anything more Than to love youIs it yours Is it mine I was never the kind who could draw the line Are you free Unforgiven Is this the kind of world you could live in It's alright The light is on The darkness has run to hide It's alright The light is on But the darkness is just outside Outside your window Beating down Making the sound of the rain Drive you crazy Make you lazy You know it's only the rain It's alright The light is on The darkness has run to hide It's alright The light is on But the darkness is just outside
