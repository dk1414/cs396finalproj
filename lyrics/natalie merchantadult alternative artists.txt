Doctors have come from distant cities Just to see me Stand over my bed Disbelieving what they're seeing They say I must be one of the wonders Of God's own creation And as far as they can see they can offer No explanation Newspapers ask intimate questions Want confessions They reach into my head To steal the glory of my story They say I must be one of the wonders Of god's own creation And as far as they can see they can offer No explanation Oh, I believe Fate smiled and destiny Laughed as she came to my cradle Know this child will be able Laughed as my body she lifted Know this child will be gifted With love, with patience and with faith She'll make her way She'll make her wayWell I've walked these streets A virtual stage It seemed to me Makeup on their faces Actors took their places next to me Well I've walked these streets In a carnival Of sights to see All the cheap thrill-seekers The vendors and the dealers They crowded around me Have I been blind Have I been lost Inside myself and my own mind Hypnotized, mesmerized By what my eyes have seen Well I've walked these streets In a spectacle of wealth and poverty In the diamond market The scarlet welcome carpet That they just rolled out for meWhere in hell can you go Far from the things that you know Far from the sprawl of concrete That keeps crawling its way About one thousand miles a day Take one last look behind Commit this to memory and mind Don't miss this wasteland, this Terrible place when you leave Keep your heart off your sleeve Motherland, cradle me Close my eyes Lullaby me to sleep Keep me safe Lie with me Stay beside me Don't go, don't you go Oh, my five and dime queen Tell me what have you seen The lust and the avarice The bottomless, the cavernous greed Is that what you see Young and strong, Hollywood son In the early morning light This star fell down On Sunset Boulevard Young and strong beautiful one That we embraced so close Is gone Was torn away Let the youth of America mourn Include him in their prayers Let his image linger on Repeat it everywhere With candles, with flowers He was one of ours One of ours Why don't you let him be He's gone, we know Give his mother and his father peace Your vulture's candor, your casual slander You murder his memory He's gone, we know It's nothing but a tragedyGo west, paradise is there You'll have all that you can eat Of milk and honey over there You'll be the brightest star the world has ever seen Sun-baked, slender heroine Of film and magazine So, go west Paradise is there You'll have all that you can eat Of milk and honey over there You'll be the brightest light the world has ever seen The dizzy height of a jet-set life You could never dream Your pale blue eyes, strawberry hair Lips so sweet Skin so fair Your future bright Beyond compare It's rags to riches Over thereYou've been so kind and generous I don't know how you keep on giving For your kindness, I'm in debt to you For your selflessness, my admiration For everything you've done You know I'm bound I'm bound to thank you for it You've been so kind and generous I don't know how you keep on giving For your kindness, I'm in debt to you And I never could have come this far without you For everything you've done You know I'm bound I'm bound to thank you for it Oh, I want to thank you For so many gifts You gave with love and tenderness I want to thank youTake a look at my body Look at my hands There's so much here That i don't understand Your face saving promises Whispered like prayers I don't need them Cause I've been treated so wrong I've been treated so long As if I'm becoming untouchable Well Contempt loves the silence It thrives in the dark With fine winding tendrils That strangle the heart They say that promises Sweeten the blow But I don't need them No, I don't need them I've been treated so wrong I've been treated so long As if I'm becoming untouchable I'm a slow dying flower I'm the frost killing hour Sweet turning sour And untouchableOooh, jealousy Is she fine So well bred The perfect girl A social deb Is she the sort You've always thought Could make you What you're not Oooh, jealousy Is she bright so well read are there novels by her bed Is she the sort You've always said Could satisfy Your head Oooh, jealousyOphelia was a bride of God A novice Carmelite In sister cells the cloister bells Tolled on her wedding night Ophelia was the rebel girl A bluestocking suffragette Who remedied society Between her cigarettes And Ophelia was the sweetheart to A nation overnight Curvaceous thighs, vivacious eyes Love was at first sight Love was at first sight Love...Ophelia was a demi-goddess In pre-war Babylon So statuesque a silhouette In black satin evening gowns Ophelia was the mistress to A Vegas gambling man Signora Ophelia Maraschina Mafia courtesan Ophelia was the circus queen The female cannonball Projected through five flaming hoops To wild and shocked applause To wild and shocked applauseI may know the word But not say it I may know the truth But not face I may hear a sound A whisper, sacred and profound But turn my head Indifferent I may know the word But not say it I may love the fruit But not taste it I may know the way To comfort and to soothe A worried face But fold my hands Indifferent If I'm on my knees I'm begging now If I'm on my knees Groping in the dark I'd be praying for deliverance From the night into the day But it's all gray here It's all gray to me
