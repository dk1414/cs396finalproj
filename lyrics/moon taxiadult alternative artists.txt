When you feel the world around you Spinnin' out of control You can find someone around you To bring you out of the cold But you don't ever have to hide What you really feel inside So put 'em up Two high We can walk together with our hands up in the sky So put 'em up Tonight We can come together We won't give up on the fight Woah-ooh So put 'em up Put 'em up Two high Sometimes it's hard to tell What we're really living for Hear the voices calling out from the streets Singin' get ready Get ready for more Singin' get ready Get ready for more nowSo sick and tired of the pouring rain I took a train to Morocco just to kill the pain Oh it might help a little, it might help a lot I don't know, but it's all I got Ran down the aisle to find a window by the bar I blew a cigarette to pieces so I lit up a cigar Oh this might hurt a little, this might hurt a lot I don't know, but it's all I got Oh, Morocco Tell me where you've been Won't you tell me what you know Oh, Morocco Tell me where you've been Won't you tell me what you know Crossing the desert when I lost the caravan I found a compass in a box buried underneath the sand Oh it might help a little, it might help a lot I don't know, but it's all I've got Running in circles I was losing my mind When you found me and you led me to the water just in time Oh this might hurt a little, this might hurt a lot I don't know, but it's all I gotYou've got your eyes on the ceiling I've got my eyes on the prize Once more again now with feeling Watch it materialize When the elevator comes back down It isn't gonna wait around Hey, hey, hey Now we're looking good as gold Hey, hey, hey Higher than a rocket go Deeper we dive Over our heads We're so alive Sleep when we're dead Hey, hey, hey Now we're looking good, now we're looking good as gold We gonna burn up the minutes We gonna blow out the fuse You've come a mighty long way to fade at the finish'Cause when the elevator leaves the ground It isn't gonna come back downMeet me in the middle You know I need you close Oh, but it's always The little Things I seem to miss the most Oh is that you out walking Or do I see a ghost Am I dreaming Am I wishing Or just a little bit of both'Cuz I run right back From Carolina And I run right back From New Orleans'Cuz I can't forget The times I held you And all those songs you sang with me And all those songs you sang with me I've been down through the valley Alleyways and Boulevards Oh but I would go forever Just to get to where you are And we all have our stories And we all made it through Oh but I don't know if I Would have made it without you Oh but I don't know if I Would have made it without youAll day and all night My eyes are open All day and all night I've been going All day and all night We stay up, we stay on All day and all night, ooh yeah Well I don't know just where I've been Same clothes on my back again And if you see me in the morning You're bound to see me hanging by a thread One more time before I go One more night before I know And if you see me in the evening You're bound to see me out of my head And I'll be going All day and all night Eyes are open All day and all night Keep me going All day and all night We stay up, we stay on All day and all nightI remember when we used to sing And go dance outside in the pouring rain We lived like we would never wake up From a dream that we shared, just the two of us But now we're tied up, bad luck Never gonna make our minds up Worn out and restless Oh, I wish that we could escape We could escape We could escape And I'd give anything to hear you tell me It's not too late It's not too late It's not too late And I'd give anything to hear you tell me It's not too late Always said that we would make the most Of what we had and keep it close Summers come and summers go The years fly by but the days go so slow, yeahStrangers just passing along Lonely horizon, you're taking me home Nightfall, and nothing to lose Sweet sensation, that you can't refuse Take it inside, and play the song Could you be loved, my number one And we're in and out and lost in mercury In and out and  lost in mercury Slow down if you want it to last We're quick like silver always coming too fast Won't you tell me wherever we are Are we moving or getting far After midnight you're fading away I'm heading home now, unless you want me to stay And we're in and out and lost in mercury In and out and  lost in mercury In and out and  lost in mercury In and out and  lost in mercuryGetting out while we can Waves are crashing on the sand Wash away with the tide Or walk away right by my side We're on our own You and me together We will make it known And sing out forever Someday, someday Out of the dark we go Someday, someday Into the year zero Oh oh, oh oh Into the year zero Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh Pick me up when I'm down Get my feet back on the ground Holding on with our hands I need you here to help me standWe had enough To last a couple of days We found a place To park and set on our way We walked for miles And left the path far behind We found a place By the riverside And we danced in the River Water And we danced in the River Water And we danced in the River Water And we danced in the River Water We spent the night Under the stars all alone And it was like Nothing else that I've ever known And all we heard Was the sound of the wind through the trees And all we felt Was the chill off the water in a breeze And we danced in the River Water And we danced in the River Water And we danced in the River Water And we danced in the River WaterSo much noise, can't block it out I don't wanna scream and shout Because I talk and talk, but no one hears a word They twist me 'round and pull me back and forth I go crazy, spinnin' my wheels around Sometimes, you gotta stop and Let the record play, let the record play We can cut the lights, do you feel it now It's taken over and gettin' loud Let the record play, let the record play There's nothin' more to talk about So close your eyes and let it out, yeah Now just for once, some time to breathe To clear my head and clear the screen Cause all I wanna do is find some release To break away and live in peace I go crazy, spinnin' my wheels around Sometimes, you gotta stop and Let the record play, let the record play We can cut the lights, do you feel it now It's taken over and gettin' loud Let the record play, let the record play There's nothin' more to talk about So close your eyes and let it out, yeah
