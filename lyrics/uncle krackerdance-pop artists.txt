thinking about the way things change Try an keep it by the reigns I'm a lone drifter, big money flipper Take anything you got on the rocks in a snifter I missed her in Kentucky, went down to Louisiana I never had no loving like I had in Alabama A man of my word and out to hurt nobody I'm just a M C to keep the boogie in the party Been sittin lodi dodi since 84 and I'll be sitting lodi dodi till I'm eighty four I couldn't ask for more, life's been sweet So you can save the planet I'll save your seat I've been gone for weeks, I ain't slept in days I can't find myself in this self made maze It's been so long since I've been fine I'm just trying to see the bottom of this bottle of wine And I know I'll see better days Well I know you'll see things my way I never thought about change until Spend a little time where time stood still Been looking for a mill, but I keep coming up shy I been a broke fool, I ain't trying to be that guy Wanna ride like lightning, roll like thunder I'm trying to get some money I ain't getting any younger At times I wonder at, at times I won't Sometimes I give a fuck, but most times I don't Don't, don't even care Through stained glass windows these eyes stare I try to stay straight but it's kicking my ass Everytime I look ahead I get a glimpse of the past I sit half mass like a soldier's flag That's why my left leg limp's and my Dickies sag It's been so long since I've been fine I'm just trying to see the bottom of this bottle of wine And I know I'll see better days Well I know you'll see things my way And I know I'll see better days Well I know you'll see things my wayHere's to the good life or so they say All those parties and games that all those people play They tell me this is the place to be All these beautiful people and nothing to see Sometimes I feel like something is gone here Something is wrong here, I don't belong here Sometimes I feel like a stranger in town And I've lost what I've found, it'll all turn around In a little while I'll be thinking about you In a little while I'll still be here without you You never gave me a reason to doubt you In a little while I'll be thinking about you baby I'll be thinking about you baby On the other side of a coin, there's a face There's a memory somewhere that I can't erase And there's a place that I'll find someday But sometimes I feel like it's slipping away Sometimes I feel like something is gone here Something is wrong here, I don't belong here Sometimes I feel like a stranger in town And I've lost what I've found, it'll all turn aroundWalked up in the bar and sat down on the stool And got the low down from the guy with the jewel He was playin pool and he thought he was good Cause he bet me five dimes, he could sink em with his foot He grabbed a stick, tried to kick it with his heel Did a sick back flip and ended up full kneel He didn't squeal, but it looked like it hurt And it did cause he took me for my cash and my shirt I got worked, but what's worse than that Just as he was leaving he tipped his hat Then he laughed and said, I'm sorry bout your luck When he walked out the door he got hit by a truck Ace's and eight's Ace's and eight's Ace's and eight's

by, that you ain't on my mind Not a place in my heart, that you don't occupy I miss you If I could  I would crawl through the phone Yeah, this drink gets me by, but it don't get me home Are you sleeping  I ain't sleeping So I wrote you a song, cause it's been so long Since I looked in your eyes If there was a way I could see you today And hold your sweet sweet smile I'd be there, I'd be there I'd be there I'm watching the clock, but the clock doesn't care I'm the star of the show called, "I wish I was there."Babe, I miss you And thinking of you puts a smile on my face And it makes me forget that I hate this place I've been dreaming But I still ain't sleeping So I wrote you a song, cause it's been so long Since I looked in your eyes If there was a way I could see you today And hold your sweet sweet smile I'd be there, I'd be there I'd be there
