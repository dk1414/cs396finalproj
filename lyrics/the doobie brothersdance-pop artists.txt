He came from somewhere back in her long ago The sentimental fool don't see Tryin' hard to recreate What had yet to be created once in her life She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale Never coming near what he wanted to say Only to realize it never really was She had a place in his life He never made her think twice As he rises to her apology Anybody else would surely know He's watching her go

can still believe there's a place in her life Someday, somewhere She will returnDon't you feel it growing, day by day People getting ready for the new Some are happy, some are sad Wo-oh-ah, we gotta
