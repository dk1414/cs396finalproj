Well it's not to say she didn't like The college station But her days left in this town Were counting down to graduation She said hey hey hey With less than three weeks to go She tried to justify the goth scene But the relevance was low And she said hey hey hey Won't you listen to me Well you can keep the punk rock Ska rap beats and house Fuck me I'm twee She packed her little teddy totebag Saved some tickets for herself Picked out her favorite Lucksmiths single Took the Cher Doll off the shelf She grabbed her Slumberland guitar case And her 14 Iced Bears ring Took down her I FO J poster And 'the band who would be king'And she said hey hey hey I'm taking 2nd to steal You know you won't meet Barker's Beauties Unless you learn to spin the wheel And she said hey hey hey Won't you listen to me Well you can keep the punk rock Ska rap beats and house Fuck me I'm tweeHey, hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey, hey Hey, hey Blast beats, arena seats And a ringtone by The Saints 		Don’t know much about those weekend punks But I’ve heard they have a claim to fame Street fights and open mikes Where the bar chords meet the beats	Anthems written for the discontent But the eyeliner is key The punks are writing love songs 	The punks are writing love songs 	The punks are writing love songs 	They’re mixing up the bag 		The punks are writing love songs 	The punks are writing love songs 	The punks are writing love songs 	They’re mixing up the bag 		I know I hardly know you and I've mispronounced your name But it's all I do to think of you and hope you feel the same Well if stupid is as stupid does then I'm the stupid king'cause whenever I'm around you, you're my everything'cause you're sweet You're so incredibly sweet'cause you're sweet You're so incredibly sweet The way you let me hold your hand in mine on Christmas day It was serious and funny and I couldn't stay Well it's not quite rocket science shot and spliced in super 8 But the time I spent with you that night, it was great'cause you're sweet You're so incredibly sweet'cause you're sweet You're so incredibly sweet I tried to write a letter but I couldn't find the words I felt more like an albatross, awkward and unsure It's pause, rewind, record, and playback if you lose your way But this feeling I don't want at night, you'll hear me say That you're sweet You're so incredibly sweet 'cause you're sweet You're so incredibly sweet 'cause your sweet You're so incredibly sweet 'cause you're sweet You're so incredibly sweet 'cause you're sweet You're so incredibly sweet'cause you're sweet You're so incredibly sweet 'cause your sweet You're so incredibly sweet 'cause you're sweet You're so incredibly sweet 'cause you're sweetDid you mean what you said when you told me you missed us Without reservation, without plans for Christmas First part was right, the rest wasn't true The same goes for me and the same goes for you Packed my things for the month but it's not necessary I told you I'd stay but it's just temporary Like swastika girls who fell back on their looks We relied on the tricks and the recycled hooks Did you want a response or just someone to edit It's not what you said, it's the way that you said it The longshoreman's daughter, when they spelled her name Found three chords of brilliance and rode them to fame, all alone Pep up the formula tonight You're not obliged to do us favors Disenchanted hearts unite When you and I were candy ravers Krushchev's Ekranoplan had failed Those weeks in August never seem fair Our love is left to sink or sail You cut the summer blonde from your hair A little time is all I need A disco bloodbath for the ages The patience left to let it bleed And a quill to fill the pages Side streets set ablaze And all roads lead to maybe Sometimes I think about those days Sometimes I wish we'd kept the baby I don't know how things could have changed At the latest Our days in Kansas wouldn't last I never learned the K U fight song Exchanging poisons from the past I hadn't heard from you in so long And if the moonlight kills the flame With all the moments we were meant to You know I'll tell the world your name I couldn't let the world forget you Things were so much easier back in 1993 I loved you for the first time on that dayAntenna towers, and distant hopes I've measured happiness with telescopes Well, I've been face to face with what my future brings The reels they turn recording blips and pings Through the white noise and distortion There's a message I can feel Just give me one sign that you're real An orange glow, some blinking lights Don't know how most folks spend their Friday nights Well I've seen evidence no one would dare dispute Witness accounts make up my life's pursuit And in those photos there's a sadness And a message I can feel Just give me one sign that you're real Please give me one sign that you're realRiki works in a record store on the weekend Between Vincent and Second street
