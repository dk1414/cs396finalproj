No tears for the creatures of the night No tears My eyes are dry Goodbye I feel so hollow I just don't understand Nothing turned out like I, like I planned My head's exploding My mouth is dry I can't help it if I've forgotten how to cry No tears for the creatures of the night No tears My eyes are dry Goodbye My eyes are dry Goodbye My eyes are dryYou're the buyer or the seller Makes you want what you can't have I'm glad I made you cry Makes you go where you can't go Makes you want what you can't have Desire Don't think, x4 Don't buy Don't think, x3 Buying the moment Sometimes I want to die in my bed All I can think about is "When are we leaving "Everytime I think of you I want a cigarette Man chooses himself Hero with a thousand faces It's the third night and the walls are shaking Boys buying boys Pleasure bringing pain, it's all the same I put my hand near my mouth so I know I'm still breathing So we joke about the T V set Calling it the "eye of Hell"I would love to have people see what I see I would love to be a pillar of strength in my community A little order, a little grace Something new to fill up this place Live a thousand lives by picture Mark, this song is for you I'm a lousy lover - I give but never take Makes you go where you can't go Makes you want what you can't haveWhy all the flags at half-mast Why the murders, the rage Where the retainers of passion Left from a sensible age To wipe the wretched history From this page What makes the people so bloated What making cancerous sin Where the god-merging shamans To make new sense of the din To make beast-calming music Out of this din It’s a jinx, it’s a jinx, it’s a jinx, it’s a jinx, it’s a jinx Why all the pressing confusion When will the answering cry come Will we be able to hear it So busy dying to die How is it we live Dying to die Why all the pressing confusion When will the answering cry come Will we be able to hear it So busy trying to die How is it we live Dying to dieWhat's the use Of feeling betrayed What's the use Of feeling at all I'm pacing the floor I'm wearing it smooth This is stupid I think I'll go home What's the use Of moving uptown Flying to Rome On your credit card An endless parade Of lawyers of finance Plenty of time With nothing to do Give me new noise Give me new affection Strange new toys From another world I need to see more Than just three dimensions Stranger than fiction Faster than lightIn a manner of speaking I just want to say That I could never forget the way You told me everything by saying nothing In a manner of speaking I don't understand How love in silence becomes reprimand But the way that i feel about you is beyond words Oh give me the words Give me the words But tell me nothing Ohohohoh give me the words Give me the words That tell me everything In a manner of speaking semantics won't do In this life that we live we only make do And the way that we feel might have to be sacrified So in a manner of speaking I just want to say That just like you I should find a way To tell you everything by saying nothing Oh give me the words Give me the words But tell me nothing Ohohohoh give me the words Give me the words That tell me everythingWhat suffering is born in the name of love...He went through life sometimes crying Never trying Sometimes crying The books that he read and the T V set All wasted time He began to think that his future lay in the hands of fate He'd move this way He'd move that way Or just hesitate It comes out the same He wondered what was to blame He travels light No excess baggage His religion saved him but there was a price to pay His friends could see it in the way he stared that day A life on over ride I was born today There were strangers there Cut me off And left me in a chloroformed cell I yelled and I yelled But nobody cared First day of school I lost my front teeth Boys beat me up cause I wasn't one of them I fought til I bled And everyone was scared Yeah everyone was scared It isn't my fault It isn't my fault It isn't my fault That I'm strange I wasn't good at kickball I wasn't good at girls I used to make a habit of peeing in my pants Cause I was scared and I couldn't dance And nobody cared but I learnedHere comes loneliness Here comes the onliness Here comes his holiness Here comes loneliness Here comes another day Here comes the only way Here comes loneliness Here comes the onliness Here comes loneliness Here comes the onliness Here comes another day Here comes the only way Here comes the morning sun Here comes another one Here comes loneliness Here comes the onliness Here comes loneliness Here comes your historyFeel like Cassandra dancing The last dance of the bones dancing In spite of sudden death as if at last She knew in a breath We'll all be dancing on our own With no past, with no regrets But Cassandra had problems She denied a God love And He ruined her gift of prophecy She could see it all But no one believed her, no one believed her No one believed her when she said"We are all victims of the dance"And seeing the future Foreseeing the future Foreseeing the future's not for us It's unimaginable Out of the black the faces come faster Than the vague slips into sleep eyes rolled Back in pain from unconsidered sources The waves of shock when you realize where you've beenThin man in a powder blue suit with eyes that slice you through The cut of his clothes was strange indeed A passing stranger with no business here, a rest stop on a voyage through time… a rest stop A passing stranger in a dream we had… the man with the patented face …the one with the telescope eyes… the man who walked away Someone handed me a gun… hit the switch and ran I laughed and shot at the ceiling… I laughed and shot at the walls The smell of fusing metal permeates the scene… music plays in empty halls… music plays in empty halls Underneath the street light the stranger calls your name He flickers to a halt… and slowly fades away
