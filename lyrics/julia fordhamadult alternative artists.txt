Who'd have thought this is how the pieces fit You and I shouldn't even try making sense of it I forgot how we ever came this far I believe we had reasons but I don't know what they are Don't blame it on my heart Love moves in mysterious ways It's always so surprising When love appears over the horizon I'll love you for the rest of my days But still it's a mystery How you ever came to me Which only proves Love moves in mysterious ways Heaven knows love is just a chance we take We make plans but then love demands a leap of faith So hold me close and never, never let me go Because even though we think we know which way the river flows That's not the way love goes Love moves in mysterious ways It's always so surprising When love appears over the horizon I'll love you for the rest of my days But still it's a mystery How you ever came to me Which only proves Love moves in mysterious waysDon't say your world lights up when I smile'Cos you know it's too late for talk like that And as this love fades, we both know that I have been betrayed I'm not looking for the answer, baby I'm just looking for a little love We're all looking for something, baby And for a minute, a minute, a minute I thought it was you I thought it was you I thought that it was you I thought it was you Don't say that you'll be there when I need you'Cos where are you when I need you now I need you The truth hurts Ooh I'm hurting now I'm hurting ooh I'm not looking for the answer baby I'm just looking for a little love We're all looking for someone baby And for a minute, a minute, a minute I wouldn't change a thing except the ending'Til the part where you broke my heart Everybody's talking about forgiveness I can't forgive you for leaving mePatches of happiness, red fades into blue Glimpses of loneliness, what more can I do Waiting for winter to melt into spring Waiting for you to let me back in I don't want to be, I don't want to be, I don't want to be here on my own I don't want to be, I don't want to be, I don't want to be left here alone on my own With patches of happiness, blue colours the day Glimpses of hopelessness, what more can I say Waiting for summer to fall into fall Waiting for it to be how it was before I don't want to hear, I don't want to hear, I don't want to hear another word I don't want to hear, I don't want to hear, I don't want to hear of lessons learned, not a word Patches of happiness, that's all that's left Glimpses of emptiness, you took the rest Waiting for winter to melt into spring, waiting for you to Let me back, let me back, let me back in I don't want to be, I don't want to be, I don't want to be here on my own I don't want to be, I don't want to be, I don't want to be left here alone on my own I don't want to hear, I don't want to hear, I don't want to hear another word I don't want to hear, I don't want to hear, I don't want to hear of lessons learnedYou light up another cigarette and I pour the wine It's four o'clock in the morning and it's starting to get light Now I'm right where I wanna be, losing track of time But I wish that it was still last night You look like you're in another world but I can read your mind How can you be so far away, lying by my side When I go away I'll miss you and I will be thinking of you Every night and day Just promise me you'll wait for me'Cause I'll be saving all my love for you And I will be home soon Promise me you'll wait for me I need to know you feel the same way too And I'll be home, I'll be home soon When I go away I'll miss you and I will be thinking of you Every night and day Just promise me you'll wait for me'Cause I'll be saving all my love for you And I will be home soon Promise me you'll wait for me I need to know you feel the same way too And I'll be home, I'll be home Promise me you'll wait for me'Cause I'll be saving all my love for you And I will be home soonGenio!You would have to be a genius to work out what it is with us And I'm no budding genius so what would I know You would have to have a first degree to understand the history Or study anthropology, so what would I know I know that in South America, they're burning down the trees Stoking up the fires of Western industries And you would have to be a genius to work out what It is with us, and I'm no budding genius, but some things I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I know, I know, I know!Voca teria que ser un genio Para saber o que se passa com a gente Mas eu nao sou em genio Entao o que sei eu Voce tem que ter un diploma Para entender a historia Ou estudar anthropologia Entao o que sei eu I know that in South America, they're burning down the trees Stoking up the fires of Western industries And you would have to be a genius to work out what It is with us, and I'm no budding genius, but some things I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I know, I know, I know, I know, I know..

The honeymoon is over I look to see what's left A pocketful of good reasons A shot at happiness That old devil is calling Alarm bell light is on Standby in my busy head In case I might be wrong And I'm here, I'm here, I'm here aren't I I'm here, I'm here, I'm here aren't I I pinch myself I'm dreaming Too good to be true That I'm the girl with everything And everything to lose And I'm here, I'm here, I'm here aren't I I'm here, I'm here, I'm here aren't I I'm looking out for something I might have missed Who knows what it is The honeymoon, the honeymoon The honeymoon is overCan we move to Italy I will take a boat and meet you there Can we move to Italy I will put fresh flowers in my hair Can we move to Italy I have been traveling With my face pressed against The windscreen of my dusty car Trying to be where you are Can we move to Italy I will take a house and make it home Can we move to Italy We can dance in Venice Kiss in Rome Can we move to Italy Meet me by the church up high on the hill Please say you will Way above the shore below Down in portafino I've got my ticket And my purple rosary I know my mission I'm set for Italy Italy Watch the sun come up The sun go down Italy Punch the air Kiss the ground Italy Dance in Venice Kiss in Rome Italy Take a little house Make it home Can we move to Italy I will take a boat and meet you there Can we move to italy I will put fresh flowers in my hair Can we move to ItalyIsland...If you make yourself an island, I'm gonna sail straight out to you If you burn your bridges one by one, I'll not give up on you But if you scratch, scratch the surface, underneath the skin Under the armour of that iron woman So many things lie within...So don't you test my love like you test the love of your boyfriends Oh don't you know the love for a woman, for a woman, for a woman Is there to the end, there to the end...?I know you're feeling bitter and twisted, I've seen it Seeping out of every pore Rising up beyond the goodness of a perfect human core And if you peel, peel away the wisdom, underneath the skin I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder what lies within...Oh don't you lose my love, oh don't you lose your love my friend Oh don't you know the love for a woman, for a woman Is there to the end, there to the end I just wanted to say you know I love you...If you bite, bite the hand that feeds you, don't think he'll Keep coming back for more'Cause this is real life not the movies girl, I've told you that before But if you scrape, scrape at the bravado, underneath the skin Under the armour of everybody, so many things lie hidden.. Yet another day slides into midnight From your camp there's not a single word Seemingly you have forgotten I'm still your girl People tell me I am strong I might have to prove them wrong As the cracks begin to show I'm trying to find the strength to let you go Missing man Hope turned out to be a dangerous lesson Faith a shallow river in disguise Running through my patient spirit Drowning my pride Chorus Missing man Missing man Do you miss me Missing man Missing man Missing man Do you miss me Missing man
