What's the furthest place from here It hasn't been my day for a couple years What's a couple more And if I go, don't forget the one good thing I almost did I learned your name without words I used my eyes, not my hands What's the closest you can come to an almost total wreck And still walk away, all limbs intact And when I go, you'll be there Crying out, begging me I won't hear I'll just go fast into this night on broken legs A near miss or a close call I keep a room at the hospital I scratch my accidents into the wall I couldn't wait to breathe your breath I cut in line, I bled to death I got to you, there was nothing left"You're not punk and I'm telling everyone."Save your breath, I never was one You don't know what I'm all about Like killing cops and reading Kerouac My enemies are all too familiar They're the ones who used to call me friend I'm coloring outside your guidelines I was passing out when you were passing out your rules One, two, three, four Who's punk  What's the score Got a friend, her name is Boxcar Cigarettes and beer in El Sob Her hair was blue, now it's green I like her mind, she hates the scene My enemies are all too familiar They're the ones who used to call me friend I'm coloring outside your guidelines I was passing out when you were passing out your rules One, two, three, four Who's punk  What's the score It gets loneliest at night Down at the liquor store Beneath the neon sky Our moonlight Six A.M., the floor comes alive with lice The pan's dried up so tight With hardened beans We're hungry So I lean on you sometimes Just to see you're still there Your feet can't take the weight of one Much less two, we hit concrete How were we born into this mess I know I painted you a prettier picture, baby We were run out on a rail Fell from the wagon to the night train I kissed the bottle I should've been kissing you You wake up to an empty night With tears for two Cigarettes, they fill the gaps In our empty days In our broken teeth We're jonesingFlattered that you think I warrant ugliness Gutters drain west, mud made a mess of us It's time to leave this place I'd saw through your wrist to find a better trap that fits I'd saw through your traps to find a better you A part of you that lasts I saw through your trap and into my own wrists Saw we were through, red ribbons spill to blue A sight to sore your eyes I got this dress I'm hiking it around this waste of laughter Slow dance alone with no one to the sound of four hands clapping Congratulations to you both, I hope somewhere you're happy If there's a moral to this story then I wish you'd show me Hair in the blood Fly in the disappointment Rubber, I'm glue I'll write the book on you It's sticking to my faceBeen staring for a hundred hours Run down a spiral drain Keep mouth clamped tight And it isn't right Three words keep running round my mind But my tongue is hard to find I need to let it go Because I know Dark secrets burn their vessel Tearing out to grab a mouthful Chunk of heart destroyed by quiet Yell it out before it kills you now Let it all out Used to let rumors do my work They got around real well Now they only hurt It's a liar's quirk This time I gotta say it straight I mean to do some good I'm calling out your name While the chance remainsWe stood in your room and laughed out loud Suddenly, the laughter died We were caught in an eye-to-eye Sat on the floor and did we sit close I could smell your thoughts and thought Do you want to touch a lot like me Too scared to say a thing Left your house and kicked myself Put those feelings on a shelf to die Guess I'm not a gamblin' type Think of what the two of us had lost, had lost Needed some time to think it out7-Eleven parkin' lot, a toothless woman turned and stopped Gave her a dime and a Chesterfield She leaned down and kissed my cheek I was scared, but it felt sweet, felt so sweet She asked me if I had a name Told her I was glued up on some chick We sat and smoked against the wall Drank a beer, felt the chill of fall, of fallBoat on a hill, never going to sea Anchored to a fixer upper's dream This boat is beat, never gonna be a boat now Thirsty, sees the sea from high on the ice plant He keeps patching it and painting Thinking about his pension plan But the boat is out to pasture Seems it never had a chance I wanna be a boat I wanna learn to swim Then I'll learn to float Then begin again I wanna be a boat I wanna learn to swim Then I'll learn to float Then begin again Begin again Boat remembers the carpenter's sure hand Missing fishy flutter on its rudder Sold at an auction, on a dolly ever since Sometimes rainy days drop boyish wonderWhat's the furthest place from here It hasn't been my day for a couple years What's a couple more And if I go, don't forget the one good thing I almost did I learned your name without words I used my eyes, not my hands What's the closest you can come to an almost total wreck And still walk away, all limbs intact And when I go, you'll be there Crying out, begging me I won't hear I'll just go fast into this night on broken legs A near miss or a close call I keep a room at the hospital I scratch my accidents into the wall I
