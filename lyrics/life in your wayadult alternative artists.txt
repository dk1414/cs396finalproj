Surely death has found me It has kept a hold of me all this far My actions will reveal Only time will tell These passions start to slip away Memories flash like seconds in a day I see the world from the outside I see the world from the outside There is something to say about being desperate Down and low Giving a chance to see what it all can mean There is something to say about being desperate Down and low Upon my arrival, I either learn to swim or drown As I struggle for air, I see only water And I reach for anything as I cry for help I feel my body growing weak Slipping away, it occurs to me that my cries are worthless Acknowledging death I no longer mourn my own loss And I begin to sing praises to the one that has me here As I sink to my salty grave, I drown No hand to reach for, no ear to listenThis is for all those who search for something more Never give up, never give in When words have no meaning Because your time in hell has left you cold and alone What was thought to be good in the world Gave you the back of their hand The breath of life has become empty, without feeling So you bury your head and distance yourself The dreams still wake you in tears and nightmares, battery and anguish Tears, nightmares, Battery and anguish All that's good in the world can be wrecked in such a short time And then you'll wonder, is the end near Take a chance, just one time Make ready your heart tonight And you sing: Is this the end  This is all I have Love is here now that you're at your endAnywhere I go Anywhere my feet take me Your compassion never fails me I've gotten so far away Alone and close to giving up Can I lay down these way not in vain Your love is the greatest thing I will look ahead to see the truth in this To see the truth in me Closer, closer to you I need it to last more than a moment, these times with you The rhythm skips a beat, and I hold the weight of the world To the touch I ache To the look I seem to be a mistake These mistakes I've made hold me back From the days I should spend with you To be long term and long lasting To overcome the lines and rules There are days where I'm right where I'm supposed to be But mostly I am far away I'm learning to live the way I should I'm learning to love the way you would And today it's been made clear that I've walked so far alone It's easy to want something more I will dive...closer to you.. I will never sleep again The way that I have now I will never close my eyes It has taken me this long to get this far It has taken me this long to get this far It has taken me so long to get this far Now I'm breaking through Making waves Smashing against the shoreline Breaking through Making waves Smashing against the shoreline I'm staying on track this time Forward motion is good I'm staying on track this time Forward motion is good Free from guilt Over it all This is my commitment I'll live and let redemption see me throughThis is who I am!I'll walk out this Kingdom not as a duty but an honor Now called a son, I've been set free from the slavery of sin And when I fall, I stand in the face of darkness and I say:This is who I am My father has freed my past, present, and future He doesn't see what I see, He doesn't see what you see He sees my destiny and calls me to be a son This is who I am, in the midst of a firefight; You've called me a son This is who I am, by the power of the risen death and what You have done This is who I am, all I've been and who I've become This is who I am, who I am: I'm a son I am among the best and the worst of us And aren't we all trying to put this and that in first place In first place Even when we don't believe in us, we don't believe in us We look right over the shoulder of a friend To wage a war that has no standing, no lasting value And brutal repercussions that will leave a man alone It's hard to negate what you've known Putting yourself out on the line Even when we don't believe in us This life has a hold of me, to a place where I dare not go ReinstateThough the hard times have its hold on me I heap these upon myself It leaves the beauty of grace not mistaken for anything at all I can't deny the change in my life I wouldn't ask for more Nothing can take that away I believe the blind will be healed and the slaved will be set free Nothing can take that away This makes me bound by what I've learned Any drive I have hasn't come from but what's been done for me This won't be made less than what it is The gift of knowing you is pure joy Some thing's change but this will stay the same The gift of knowing you is pure joySome of you need to hear this for the first time, and so this is from our hearts...The Kingdom of God is for the burnouts, the broken, and the broke, the drug addicts, the divorced, the H IV positive, the herpes-ridden, the hopeless, for the outcasts that have been created by the church, and for the outcasts of our society that have been created by us The Kingdom of God is for the brain damaged, the incurably ill, for the barren, for the pregnant too many times, and the pregnant at the wrong time  This is for the over-employed, the underemployed, the unemployable, and the unemployed  This is for the swindled, the shoved aside, the left aside, the replaced, the incompetent, and the stupid  This is for the emotionally starved and the emotionally dead  The Kingdom of God is for the bigoted, the murderers, the child molesters, the brutals, the drug lords, the terrorists, the perverted, the raging alcoholics, over consumers, the incredibly ugly, the dumb, the ignorant, the starving, the filled, and the filthy rich  The Kingdom of God is for everyone and the Kingdom of God is for me."Beneath it all, this world bridges a hate It will take us all down, down to ruin I am being pushed all this way A welcomed self-seeking livelihood, is a doom for all Everything must recede, everything We rip our hands through anything And then we make it please ourselves It these ways I can't change Not even one step on my own, on my own...Break the chains that hold I've been kept so long Break the chains, keep so long Can someone help me through this mess The lies and the ties that bind Do not be deceived This will fade away Can someone bring me to, bring me to the feet The feet of JesusSing with me tonight Let's tear open the skies and leave it all behind by singing this tonight I would never leave you for a chance, for a moment I would never leave you for a chance, in this lifetime So leave it all behind..  leave it all behind
