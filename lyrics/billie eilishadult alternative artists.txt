Thought I found a way Thought I found a way out But you never go away So I guess I gotta stay now Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here Even if it takes all night or a hundred years Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear Isn't it lovely, all alone Heart made of glass, my mind of stone Tear me to pieces, skin to bone Hello, welcome home Walking out of time Looking for a better place Something's on my mind Always in my head space But I know someday I'll make it out of here Even if it takes all night or a hundred years Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fearDon't you know I'm no good for you I've learned to lose you, can't afford to Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'But nothin' ever stops you leavin'Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that Don't you know too much already I'll only hurt you if you let me Call me friend, but keep me closer And I'll call you when the party's over Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that But nothin' is better sometimes Once we've both said our goodbyes Let's just let it go Let me let you goWhen I'm away from you I'm happier than ever Wish I could explain it better I wish it wasn't true Give me a day or two to think of something clever To write myself a letter To tell me what to do, mm-mm Do you read my interviews Or do you skip my avenue When you said you were passin' through Was I even on your way I knew when I asked you to Be cool about what I was tellin' you You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do And I'd end up more afraid Don't say it isn't fair You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable So if you really wanna know When I'm away from you I'm happier than ever Wish I could explain it better I wish it wasn't true, mm-mmWhite shirt now red, my bloody nose Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes Creepin' around like no one knows Think you're so criminal Bruises on both my knees for you Don't say thank you or please I do what I want when I'm wanting to My soul  So cynical So you're a tough guy Like it really rough guy Just can't get enough guy Chest always so puffed guy I'm that bad type Make your mama sad type Make your girlfriend mad tight Might seduce your dad type I'm the bad guy Duh I'm the bad guy I like it when you take control Even if you know that you don't Own me, I'll let you play the role I'll be your animal My mommy likes to sing along with me But she won't sing this song If she reads all the lyrics She'll pity the men I knowI had a dream I got everything I wanted Not what you'd think And if I'm bein' honest It might've been a nightmare To anyone who might care Thought I could fly So I stepped off the Golden, mm Nobody cried Nobody even noticed I saw them standing right there Kinda thought they might care I had a dream I got everything I wanted But when I wake up, I see You with me And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to If I could change the way that you see yourself You wouldn't wonder why you hear'They don't deserve you'"Don't be that way Fall apart twice a day I just wish you could feel what you say Show, never tell But I know you too well Got a mood that you wish you could sell If teardrops could be bottled There'd be swimming pools filled by models Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"If "I love you" was a promise Would you break it, if you're honest Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before I don't wanna be you Anymore Hands getting cold Losing feeling is getting old Was I made from a broken mold Hurt, I can't shake We've made every mistake Only you know the way that I breakBillie What do you want from me  Why don't you run from me What are you wondering  What do you know Why aren't you scared of me  Why do you care for me When we all fall asleep, where do we go Come here Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly You're payin'  Is the amount cleanin' you out  Am I satisfactory Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly The way I'm drinkin' you down Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me Step on the glass, staple your tongue Bury a friend, try to wake up Cannibal class, killing the son Bury a friend, I wanna end me I wanna end me I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…It's not true Tell me I’ve been lied to Crying isn't like you, ooh What the hell did I do Never been the type to Let someone see right through, ooh Maybe won't you take it back Say you were tryna make me laugh And nothing has to change today You didn’t mean to say "I love you"I love you and I don't want to, ooh Up all night on another red-eye I wish we never learned to fly Maybe we should just try To tell ourselves a good lie Didn't mean to make you cry Maybe won't you take it back Say you were tryna make me laugh And nothing has to change today You didn't mean to say "I love you"I love you and I don't want to, oohTry not to abuse your power I know we didn't choose to change You might not wanna lose your power But havin' it's so strange She said you were a hero You played the part But you ruined her in a year Don't act like it was hard And you swear you didn't know No wonder why you didn't ask She was sleepin' in your clothes But now she's got to get to class How dare you And how could you Will you only feel bad when they find out If you could take it all back Would you Try not to abuse your power I know we didn't choose to change You might not wanna lose your power But havin' it's so strangeI should have known I'd leave alone Just goes to show That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe We were a pair But I saw you there Too much to bear You were my life, but life is far away from fair Was I stupid to love you Was I reckless to help Was it obvious to everybody else That I'd fallen for a lie You were never on my side Fool me once, fool me twice Are you death or paradise Now you'll never see me cry There's just no time to die I let it burn You're no longer my concern, mmm Faces from my past return Another lesson yet to learn
