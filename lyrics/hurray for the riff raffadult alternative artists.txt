arm I wanted love, wanted love Oh, but I just couldn't give enoughMan built the railroad, man gotta move Man made a record, put a needle to the groove Man been up, oh, man been down Now man don't want

Rican Beach Well, you can take my life But don't take my home Baby, it's a solid price It comes with my bones Now all the politicians They just squawk their mouths They say, "we'll build a wall to keep them out"And all the poets were dying Of a silence disease So it happened quickly and with much easeMy heart is a blue ridge mountain And my head an over-flowing fountain Oh, my heart is a blue

something I can offer You know the heart is not the hopeless The heart is a lonely hunter Hot long summer days We're just sneakin' by the river Well, I'll lock my dreams away And I'll watch the city quiverI know it's wrong but I can't help But want you all babe to myself Love is a game we foolishly play I guess it's always been that way I know it's wrong, but that's alright The sun is laughing in my face Shining its light on my mistakes You could be my Adam I'll be your summertime I'll feed you watermelon off the vine I know it's wrong, but that's alright Well I take you out, like I did before I send you right, the nearest liquor store And I tell you one thing Always made some sense It's never wrong to hop a fence Now I know it's wrong, but it feels right Just to love you babe, for all my life I know it's wrong, but that's alrightRhododendron Nightblooming jasmine Deadly nightshade Fox Glove renegade Rhododendron I can hear you speaking You can feel me breathing Break my head open
