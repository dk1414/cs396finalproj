tumblin' down And they didn't even put up a fight They didn't even make a sound I found a way to let you win But I never really had a doubt Standin' in the light of your halo I got my angel now It's like I've been awakened Every rule, I had you breakin'It's the risk that I'm takin'I ain't never gonna shut you out Everywhere I'm lookin' now I'm surrounded by your embrace Baby, I can see your halo You know you're my savin' grace You're everything I need and more It's written all over your face Baby, I can feel your halo Pray it won't fade awayI found a love for me Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love Not knowin' what it was I will not give you up this time But, darling, just kiss me slow Your heart is all I own And in your eyes, you're holding mine Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight Well, I found a man stronger than anyone I know He shares my dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home I found a love to carry more than just my secrets To carry love, to carry children of our ownIf I were a boy Even just for a day I'd roll out of bed in the morning And throw on what I wanted then go Drink beer with the guys And chase after girls I'd kick it with who I wanted And I'd never get confronted for it'Cause they'd stick up for me If I were a boy I think I could understand How it feels to love a girl I swear I'd be a better man I'd listen to her'Cause I know how it hurts When you lose the one you wanted'Cause he's taken you for granted And everything you had got destroyed If I were a boy I would turn off my phone Tell everyone it's broken So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone I'd put myself first And make the rules as I go'Cause I know that she'd be faithful Waitin' for me to come home To come homeI've been watchin' for the signs Took a trip to clear my mind, oh Now I'm even more lost And you're still so fine, oh, my, oh, my Been havin' conversations about breakups and separations I'm not feelin' like myself since the baby Are we gonna even make it  Oh'Cause if we are, we're takin' this a little too far If we are, we're takin' this a little too far Baby, if we are, we're takin' this a little too far With me bein' wherever I'm at Worried 'bout wherever you are We're takin' this a little too far We're takin'
