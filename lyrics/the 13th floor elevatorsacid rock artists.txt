Alpha information sending States within the heaven shower From disciples the unending Subtleties of river power They slip inside this house as they pass by If your limbs begin dissolving In the water that you tread All surroundings are evolving In the stream that clears your head Find yourself a caravan Like Noah must have led And slip inside this house as you pass by Slip inside this house as you pass by True conception, knowing why Brings even more than meets the eye Slip inside this house as you pass by In this dark we call creation We can be and feel and know From an effort - comfort station That's surviving on the go There's infinite survival in The high baptismal glow Slip inside this house as you pass byOnce, somewhere, sometime ago His eyes were clear to see He put his thoughts into my mind And gave my self to be He stopped me from living so unsane I could be just what I want to be Things appear as they really are I can see just what I wanted to see Come on, and let it happen to you I say, I say come on, and let it happen to you You gotta open up your mind And let everything come through...Come on yeah!Well it starts like a roller coaster ride So real it takes your breath away It slides you through your point of view You look back to where you thought you'd stayed Your ride changes outside view While it glides you like a neon ray And you find you don't have to search for words For there's nothing to be saidHere you are at my place within your glistening eyes I'm watching your reactions as the thing within you cries And I'm bringing you this message 'cause I think it's time you knew That the kingdom of heaven is within you The incense and the candles and the colors on the wall Your image stands reflected as a princess come to call Your suspicions I'm confirming as you find them all quite true And the kingdom of heaven is within you Through the stained glass windows, moonlight flashes on the choir And splashes on the altar in glows of liquid fire Then it bathes you with its glory and you begin life anew And the kingdom of heaven is within youWell, you finally find your helpless mind is trapped inside your skin You want to leave, but you believe you won't get back again You only know you have to go But still you can't get out You try and try, you die and die You're stopped by your own doubt Reverberation, reverberation You find no peace, it doesn't cease It's deadly irritation It keeps you blind, it's there behind Its every hesitation It holds your thought, your mind is caught You're fixed with fascination You think you'll die, it's just a lie It's backward elevation Reverberation, reverberation You see reverberation In your latest incarnation You think it's a sensation But it's just reverberationI've seen your face before I've known you all my life And though it's new Your image cuts me like a knife And now I'm home And now I'm home And now I'm home to stay The neon from your eyes Is splashing into mine They're so familiar In a way I can't define And now I'm home And now I'm home And now I'm home to stay Though this is our first meeting We needn't bother speaking All we might say is understoodLet me take you to the empty place in my fire engine Let me take you to the empty place in my fire engine It can drive you out of your mind Climb the ladder of your own design in my fire engine Don't you tell it to go slow or stop You've got to work it right up to the top A piercing bolt of neon red Explodes on fire inside your head Let me take you to the empty place in my fire engine Let me take you to the empty place in my fire engine Boiling rhythms making your ears ring Rounding the corners you can feel the ring of my fire engine Close your eyes and you erase Your image you no longer chase A fiery flood engulfs your brain And drowns your thoughts with scarlet rain Let me take you to the empty place in my fire engine Let me take you to the empty place in my fire engine It can drive you out of your mind Climb the ladder of your own design in my fire engineDon't fall down If you see her Don't fall down If you're by her side Don't fall down When you're near her Don't fall down If your voice is tied Don't fall down Don't deceive her Don't fall down Tell her what you feel Don't fall down She'll perceive you Don't fall down If your voice is real Every time you need her, she is there To ease the pain that fogs you And when you don't need her, from her stare She says she's needing you Don't fall down As you love her Don't fall down She loves only you Don't fall down As you lift her Don't fall down She believes in you Don't fall down From beside her Don't fall down Keep behind her eyes Don't fall down They're behind you Don't fall down As the thought appliesChaos all around me With its fevered clinging But I can hear you singing In the corners of my brain Every doubt that bounds me Every sound of riot Everything is quiet But the song that keeps me sane I can hear your voice, echoing my voice softly I can feel your strength, reinforcing mine If you fear I'll lose my spirit Like a drunkard's wasted wine Don't you even think about it, I'm feeling fine I can hear your voice, echoing my voice softly I can feel your strength, reinforcing mine If you fear I'll lose my spirit Like a drunkard's wasted wine Don't you even think about it, I'm feeling fineThru the rhythm of darkened times Painted black by knowledge crimes And repetition's pointless mime Instilling values the sick define That weaves the fabric that keeps you blind And ties your hands and cloaks your mind But on my stilts, I'm above the slime Come on up If you can make the climb But who am I Who am I Who am I I've smelled the stench from the fumes that rise From the books that rehash the same old lies I've felt the panic that they disguise In the forms of laws of every size I've heard the teachers whining Make you drop out like flies But you know they teach you nonsense'Cause they can't blind your eyes I've seen the fools gold They pawn off as their prize
