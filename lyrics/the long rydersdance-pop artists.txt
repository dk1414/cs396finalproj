Pack my bags packed it in Never coming back here again Paid my dues and stayed in line16 years I served my time Now what I did I do regret And all the days that I had wept Up all night and you can bet I’ve got to live with that See the lights of downtown That’s where I shot that old man down Now the heat’s calling me Caused my insanity Now when I walked and people say#How could he just walk away Had a gun no daughter no son One life is gone and one begun Now what I did I do regret And all the days that I had wept Up all night and you can bet I’ve got to live with that See the lights of downtown That’s where I shot that old man down Now the heat’s calling me Caused my insanityStarting out from Ferraday like a runaway bus Moving north toward Memphis in a cloud of highway dust Rolling to the rhythm of a sound he never hears He's possessed by something which never comes quite clear Although it might be coming from above It always brings him down I'm sorry Mr  Phillips about Presley and the rest But as you know I'm Elmo's boy, I'm different from the rest From Tupelo to Natchez they all answer to my name Their belief in God above is driving them insane And if I die before I wake, there'll be no soul left to take Hellfire is a-callin' like a leper come a-crawlin'Kicking down the doors of your life Yeah, the women and the wine are just gigs you left behind They ain't gigs when they's your life Hellfire is a-bawlin' like some baby come a-crawlin'Kicking down the doors of your life Yeah, the women and the wine are just gigs you left behind They ain't gigs when they's your lifeHave you seen the twilight turning today The summer sun is slowly fading away But I hope you know, any place you go Your love will always shine like an afterglow So we'll meet again when the road comes back around I have a memory and it's triggered, I have found When leaves are falling down The seasons change but my love will stick around Even though the sky is now turned to stone The night is listening to the words far from home And I hope it's clear until you reappear Your love will always shine from therе to here So we'll meet again whеn the road comes back around I have a memory and it's triggered, I have found When snow is falling down The seasons change but my love will stick around
