I would love to show you If you'll try to understand You need someone to lead you To the heaven in your hands You can try to make it on your own But if you ever change your mind Then you will never be alone Don't get left behind We can be together If you'd only realise The way to live forever Is to give away your life Wherever you go, always in my heart Forever with me, we would never be apart I want you to know, always on my mind Whatever you do I know that I have found no ordinary love So will you try to understand The love that I can give, will never be enough And I can never change your mind Don't get left behindI wanna be the way You are Don't wanna be the one to stay in the dark I wanna live the way You live I wanna do it in the way that You did Each time I talk about it Well I can feel the love in Your eyes And when I think about it I realize, this is where I wanna be And will You take me high So I can reach the sky With a love that never dies This is where I wanna be And when You lift me up And then You bring me down If I know that You're around This is where I wanna be I wanna love the way You love The love that I can give is never enough I wanna see the way You see So I can understand the way it should be Each time I talk about it Well I can feel the love in Your eyes And when I think about it I realize, this is where I wanna beWe were just beginning I didn't know your name You were there with everybody Walking in the rain I didn't have to tell you You didn't have to ask I knew that we'd be friends forever I knew that we could last Tried to show you all that I believe How you are to me More than I could ever think or dream You're all that a friend can be I remember walking with you In the summer late afternoon Looking out for something to do'cos you know we're best friends But if I don't know where you are You will always be in my heart All along we knew we would part But you know we're best friends I could understand you And you could make me laugh I never meant to take for granted All the time we had So the time is here now We're gonna be apart And now I'm gonna take you with me If only in my heartI know this place I saw you so many times I'd see your face If I could only rewind I got to know you at the end of the day I had to show you Now you have gone away Do I believe that I will see you again Can I believe it How will it end I could've told you The way it would be And when I saw you I should've let you know I wanna tell you Don't wanna hear there's no more time Why did I let you go Can't take this shame It's taking over my life I was to blame But how could I realise And now I know your life is over And I'm feeling the pain Tell me someone tried to show you Will I see your face againWhy did I wait for so long To change my mind I was afraid to know you When I was blind So much more than I deserve Is everything You've given me You will never let me go And through the sunshine and rain Through the heartache and pain I know You'll always remain in my heart And I know wherever I go And whatever I do You are forever the same You will never change Where would I be without You What would I do My life was going nowhere When I found you There is nowhere I can go Without Your love There is nothing I can do I will give my life to youI would love to show you If you'll try to understand You need someone to lead you To the heaven in your hands You can try to make it on your own But if you ever change your mind Then you will never be alone Don't get left behind We can be together If you'd only realise The way to live
