One pill makes you larger And one pill makes you small And the ones that mother gives you Don't do anything at all Go ask Alice When she's ten feet tall And if you go chasing rabbits And you know you're going to fall Tell 'em a hookah smoking caterpillar Has given you the call He called Alice When she was just small When the men on the chessboard Get up and tell you where to go And you've just had some kind of mushroom And your mind is moving low Go ask Alice I think she'll know When logic and proportion Have fallen sloppy dead And the White Knight is talking backwards And the Red Queen's off with her head Remember what the Dormouse said Feed your head Feed your headWhen the truth is found to be lies And all the joy within you dies Don't you want somebody to love Don't you need somebody to love Wouldn't you love somebody to love You better find somebody to love Love, love When the garden flowers Baby, are dead, yes and Your mind, your mind is so full of red Don't you want somebody to love Don't you need somebody to love Wouldn't you love somebody to love You better find somebody to love Your eyes, I say your eyes may look like his Yeah, but in your head, baby I'm afraid you don't know where it isToday, I feel like pleasing you more than before Today, I know what I wanna do, but I don’t know what for To be living for you is all I want to do To be loving you it’ll all be there when my dreams come true Today you’ll make me say that I somehow have changed Today you look into my eyes, I’m just not the same To be any more than all I am would be a lie I’m so full of love I could burst apart and start to cry Today, everything you want I swear it all will come true Today, I realize how much I’m in love with you With you standing here, I could tell the world what it means to love To go on from here, I can’t use words but it don’t say enough Please, please listen to me It’s taken so long to come true And it’s all for you All for youLook what's happening out in the streets Got a revolution, got to revolution Hey, I'm dancing down the street Got a revolution, got to revolution Ain't it amazing all the people I meet Got a revolution, got to revolution One generation got old One generation got soul This generation got no dissertation to hold Pick up the cry Hey now it's time for you and me Got a revolution, got to revolution Come on now, we're marching to the sea Got a revolution, got to revolution Who will take it from you, we will and who are we We are volunteers of America Volunteers of America Volunteers of America Volunteers of America Volunteers of AmericaWe can be together Ah, you and me We should be together We are all outlaws in the eyes of America In order to survive, we steal, cheat, lie, forge, fuck, hide, and deal We are obscene, lawless, hideous, dangerous, dirty, violent And young We should be together Come on all you people standin' around Our life's too fine to let it die We should be together All your private property is Target for your enemy And your enemy is we We are forces of chaos and anarchy Everything they say we are, we are And we are very proud of ourselvesThe summer had inhaled and held its breath too long The winter looked the same as if it never had gone And through an open window where no curtain hung I saw you I saw you Comin' back to me One begins to read between the pages of a look The shape of sleepy music and suddenly you're hooked Through the rain upon the trees that kisses on the run I saw you I saw you Comin' back to me You came to stay and live my way Scatter my love like leaves in the wind You always say you won't go away But I know what it always has been It always has been A transparent dream beneath an occasional sigh Most of the time I just let it go by Now I wish it hadn't begun I saw you Yes I saw you Comin' back to meSnow cuts loose from the frozen Until it joins with the African sea In moving it changes its cold and its name The reason I come and go is the same Animal game for me You call it rain, but the human name Doesn't mean shit to a tree If you don't mind heat in your river And fork tongue talking from me Swim like an eel, fantastic snake Take my love when it's free Electric feel with me You call it loud, but the human crowd Doesn't mean shit to a tree Change the strings and notes slide Change the bridge and string shift down Shift the notes and bridge sings Fire eating people Rising toys of the sun Energy dies without body warm Icicles ruin your gunLather was thirty years old today They took away all of his toys His mother sent newspaper clippings to him About his old friends who'd stopped being boys There was Howard C  Green Just turned thirty-three His leather chair waits at the bank And Sergeant Dow Jones Twenty-seven years old Commanding his very own tank But Lather still finds it A nice thing to do To lie about nude in the sand Drawing pictures of mountains That look like bumps And thrashing the air with his hands But wait, oh Lather's productive, you know He produces the finest of sound Putting drumsticks on either side of his nose Snorting the best licks in town But that's all overEvery day I try so hard to know your mind And find out what's inside you Time goes on and I don't know just where you are Or how I'm going to find you You can do whatever you please The world's waiting to be seized You can collect all the neglect Or all the self-respect you need And I know And I know And I know Your mind's guaranteed It's all you'll ever need So what do you want with me We live but once but good things can be found around In spite of all the sorrow If you see black you can't look back You can't look front you cannot face tomorrow Some have it nice Flash paradise They're very wise to their disguise Trying to revolutionize tomorrowIf you want to get to heaven Over on the other shore Stay out of the way of the blood stained bandit Oh good shepherd, feed my sheep One for Paul, one for Silas One for to make my heart rejoice Can't you hear my lambs a callin'Oh good shepherd, feed my sheep If you want to get to heaven Over on the other shore Stay out of the way of the long tongue liar Oh good shepherd, feed my sheep One for Paul, one for Silas One for to make my heart rejoice Can't you hear my lambs a callin Oh good shepherd feed my sheep If you want to get to heaven Over on the other shore Stay out of the way of the gun shot devil Oh good shepherd, feed my sheep
