We all came out to Montreux On the Lake Geneva shoreline To make records with a mobile We didn't have much time But Frank Zappa and the Mothers Were at the best place around But some stupid with a flare gun Burned the place to the ground Smoke on the water And fire in the sky Smoke on the water They burned down the gambling house It died with an awful sound Funky Claude was running in and out Pulling kids out the ground When it all was over We had to find another place But Swiss time was running out It seemed that we would lose the raceSweet child, in time, you'll see the line The line that's drawn between good and bad See the blind man shooting at the world Bullets flying, taking toll If you've been bad, oh Lord, I bet you have And you've not been hit, oh by flying lead You'd better close your eyes Bow your head Wait for the ricochet Uhhh-uhhh-uhhh Uhhh-uhhh-uhhh Uhhh-uh-uh Uhhh-uhh Uhhh-uhhh-uhhh Uhhh-uhhh-uhhh Uhhh-uh-uh Uhhh-uhh Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh Ahhh-ah-ahI have often told you stories About the way I lived the life of a drifter Waiting for the day When I'd take your hand And sing you songs Then maybe you would say"Come lay with me and love me"And I would surely stay But I feel I'm growing older And the songs that I have sung Echo in the distance Like the sound Of a windmill going around I guess I'll always be A soldier of fortune Many times I've been a traveler I looked for something new In days of old When nights were cold I wandered without you But those days I thought my eyes Had seen you standing near Though blindness is confusing It shows that you're not hereCan you remember, remember my name As I flow through your life A thousand oceans I have flown Oh-oh-oh And cold, cold spirits of ice, ah, ah All my life I am the echo of your past I am returning the echo of a point in time And distant faces shine A thousand warriors I have known Oh, oh-oh-oh And laughing as the spirits appear All your life Shadows of another day And if you hear me talking on the wind You've got to understand We must remain perfect strangers Ah, ah, ah, no I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow A strand of silver hanging through the sky Touching more than you see The voice of ages in your mind, oh-oh-oh Is aching with the dead of the night Oh-uh-oh, precious life Your tears are lost in falling rain And if you hear me talking on the wind You've got to understand We must remain perfect strangers Oh, oh-oh Oh, yeahNobody gonna take my car I'm gonna race it to the ground Nobody gonna beat my car It's gonna break the speed of sound Ooh, it's a killing machine It's got everything Like a driving power Big fat tires and everything I love it And I need it I bleed it Yeah, it's a wild hurricane Alright, hold tight I'm a highway star Nobody gonna take my girl I'm gonna keep her to the end Nobody gonna have my girl She stays close on every bend Ooh, she's a killing machine She's got everything Like a moving mouth Body control and everythingNa-na-na-na Na-na-na, na-na-na Na-na-na-na Na-na-na, na-na-na I got a certain little girl, she's on my mind No doubt about it, she looks so fine She's the best girl that I ever had Sometimes she's gonna make me feel so bad Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na Hush, hush I thought I heard her calling my name now Hush, hush She broke my heart but I love her just the same now Hush, hush Thought I heard her calling my name now Hush, hush I need her loving and I'm not to blame nowThe sky is red, I don't understand Past midnight I still see the land People are saying the woman is damned She makes you burn with a wave of her hand The city's ablaze, the town's on fire The woman's flames are reaching higher We were fools, we called her a liar All I hear is"Burn!"I didn't believe she was the devil's sperm She said, "Curse you all, you'll never learn""When I leave there's no return"The people laughed till she said, "Burn!"Warning came, no one cared Earth was shaking, we stood and stared When it came no one was spared Still I hear"Burn!"You know we had no time We could not even try You know we had no timeIf you're leaving, close the door I'm not expecting people, anymore Hear me grieving, lying on the floor Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure I'm a blind man I'm a blind man And my world is pale When a blind man cries Lord, you know There ain't a sadder tale Had a friend once, in a room Had a good time But it ended much too soon In a cold month, in that room We found a reason For the things we had to do I'm a blind man I'm a blind man Now my room is cold When a blind man cries Lord, you know He feels it from his soulThere once was a woman A strange kind of woman The kind that gets written down in history Her name was Nancy Her face was nothing fancy She left a trail of happiness and misery I loved her Everybody loved her She loved everyone and gave them good return I tried to take her I even tried to break her She said, "I ain't for taking, won't you ever learn "I want you, I need you, I got to be near you I spent my money as I took my turn I want you, I need you, I got to be near you Ooh, I got a strange kind of woman She looked like a raver But I could never please her On Wednesday mornings boy, you can't go far I couldn't get her But things got better, she said"Saturday nights from now on baby, you're my star"I want you, I need you, I got to be near you I spent my money as I took my turn I want you, I need you, I got to be near you Ooh, I got a strange kind of womanSweet Lucy was a dancer But none of us would chance her Because she was a samurai She made electric shadows Beyond our fingertips And none of us could reach that high She came on like a teaser I had to touch and please her Enjoy a little paradise The log was in my pocket When Lucy met the rocket She never knew the reason why I can't deny it With that smile on her face Oh, it's not the kill It's the thrill of the chase Feel it coming It's knocking at the door You know it's no good running It's not against the law The point of no return Now you know the score And now you're learning Ah-ha, what's knocking at your back door
