Hollywood livin'Another night on a thousand count linen Wouldn't drop a dollar to save your momma But, fuck em' all long as the team is winningStepped off of the train in this town May look kind of strange Kind of rough all around You don't know what I've been through But you'd better not stare Better watch your mouth boy Don't be fooled No need to be scared But you need to be aware You think you own this town I don't care At the ridge they bare I'm just looking for some brothers in arms And the woman with the long dark hair Don't call an outlaw, no I'm a motherfuckin gunslinger You wanna run your mouth all day long You'd better keep your eye On my motherfuckin trigger finger Do you feel me punk Do you feel me punk Do you feel me punk Do you feel me punk Some people think they know me Think they can predict me Think they gotta diss me when I'm not around And when I come dark and in the door They get weak in the knees and crumble like a castle to the ground'Cause they know I ain't taking no shit I got a woman who left me White with a heart of cold stone When they see the black in my eyes They see a man so deep in the red that it chills them to the boneAlone with the morning burning red in the canvas in my head Painting a picture of you And me driving across country, in a dusty old R VJust the road and its majesty And I'm looking at you with the world in the rear view Chorus You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat Looking at me, telling me you love me, and your happy to be With me on the 4th of July We sang Stranglehold to the stereo Couldn't take no more of that rock n roll So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along Those white lines get drawn into the sun if you ain't got no one To keep you hanging on And there you were like a queen with your nightgown Riding shotgun from town to town Staking a claim on the world we found And I'm singing to you, your singing to me ,you were out of the blue to a boy like me Chorus You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat Looking at me, telling me you love me, and your happy to be With me on the 4th of July We sang Stranglehold to the stereo Couldn't take no more of that rock n roll So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along And im looking for you in the silence that we shareRuby red lipstick kiss on the head Sweat a lot of sleep it's a wet bed Matchbook collection beside the chair Boy you know daddy only sits there Leather bound bible in the hotel I'll be back in an hour she said Count the ceiling fan blade goin round Lullaby Tom Petty I'm goin down, goin down Oooh, rock and roll baby Underwater in a deep dream Rocketship go to the moon In the party with the lights on She got a couple friends out there Got a man with the long hair She'll be heart broke by thе sunlight And give it all to the rock and roll baby She got a couplе friends out there Got a man with the long hair She'll be heart broke by the sunlight And give it all to the rock and roll babyI've been a missionary for the devil I've carried so much weight upon my shoulders I've seen an open sky from underground I fell asleep inside and almost drowned Been in a corner with a king or two I shared a stage with a legendary few Been broken-hearted by the ones I trusted But none of that compares to what she put me through Out in this open ocean I'm on an island standing There's only me to blame and There's only you controllin'There's no more me pretеnding No time in the hour Just one singlе rose on your pillow Yeah, the sun's going down on the midnight strip You're feelin' it baby Everything's possible, alright Just say alright and jump out and let go Holdin' me down loosen up your grip You're feeling it baby Everything's possible, alright Just say alright And jump out and let goI had a cure, for your disease But you threw it away And you made it clear I was not welcome on these seas And you threw it away So I sailed and I sailed for so long My hair grew long and my heart grew cold I face certain death without you near And I felt the storm and swam until the skies were clear And I found a home along this crooked road And all of this would have been All of this could have been yours All of this should have been All of this could have been yours Black clouds roll, right over red doors As the waves were high Sooo was I And the moon never looked so angry As when your walls came crumbling down It was so beautiful It was so peacefulBefore the cocaine and the midnight train she was a pretty girl Before the tears fell on her lonely smile she was a silly girl She was dancing around like there was no one around there wasn't any girls She was holding a bag over a mirror in class like one of many girls, many girls When it was time to put it all on the line she was a ready girl Taken the shots another one on the rocks she was a steady girl Dope in the bag anothеr tote in the trash it's just a pity girl Nevеr enough no it was never enough she was a gimme girl, gimme girl And the beat it rolls over and over Like the wheels under the Chevy Nova It goes on, it goes on, it goes on, it goes on on forever through the stars it's solar Yeah she's in the Radio Radio The radio Radio Radio Ah ohI'm just one promise away From a big marquee in front of the small town theater girl Pretty red rope set up for you The popcorn's fresh and the Coke is too Oh yeah Oh

inside my head Yeah, drinking me rotten Loaded it up, shoot it down, drinking me rotten All day, here they come knocking Load me up, shoot me down, drinking me rottenCowboys ain't easy to love And they're harder to hold And they'd rather give you a song Than diamonds or gold Lonestar belt buckles and old faded Levis And each night begins a new day If you don't understand him and he don't die young He'll probably just ride away Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys'Cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone Even with someone they love Cowboys like smoky old pool rooms And clear mountain mornings Little warm puppies and children And girls of the night Them that don't know him Won't like him and them that do Sometimes you don't know how to take him He ain't wrong, he's just different But his pride won't let him Do things to make you think he's rightSunshine Cheerwine Suppertime And nursery rhyme Yeah, sunshine Cheerwine Suppertime And nursery rhymes Daddy’s having friends Over to the house again Times were a
