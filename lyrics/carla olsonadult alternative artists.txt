My daddy was a handsome gambler He had a chain five miles long On every link a heart gets dangled Of another maid he loved and wronged He told to you some loving story He'd make you think he'd leave them true But love grows cold as love grows older And fades away like morning dew I'd rather be in some dark hollow Where the sun refused to shine Than to live here in Missouri With your memory always on my mind Come all ye fair and tender ladies Take warning how your court your man They're like a star on a summer's morning First they appear then they're gone again Your man They're like a star on a summer morning First they appear then they're gone again SO LO Come all ye fair and tender ladies take warning how your court your man They're like a star on a summer morning First they appear then they're gone againCrank her over once again Put your face into the wind Find another road where you're never been Sing that two-wheeled melody The highway symphony You know she'll never understand Gypsy Rider sing Your who-wheeled symphony You know there's nothing to explain She should have known by now You're just a vagabond You may never pass this way again All the writings on the wall The paper all must fall You're only as good as your word remains You can take it out if you Decide to follow through Just take what you earn and leave what remains Gypsy Rider sing Your two-wheeled symphony You know there's nothing to explain She should have known by now You're just a vagabond You may never pass this way againMy name is Del Gato born close to the border Of white blood and red blood I came I travel the saddle I follow the cattle Down on the range where they graze And I just ride in from a hard south western drive My lips parched and bloodied My face torn by sand storms and pride Loyalty riches and inner bred ditches ?Was the brew that I drank as a child So rebellious a lover Don Juan as a my cover They die cast my type called me wild ?And I just ride in from a hard southwestern drive The hanging tree is waiting for me to arrive Structured political our children they ridiculed They teach them of sins and to lie Their schools build't by fools but by breaking the rules Like A fox I am forced now to hide And I just ride in from a hard south western drive My lips parched and bloodied My face torn by sand storms and pride Pepper tree spreads taking many mans heads ?But the one they would want most is mine To the mission I go I In San Juan and I kneel And I pray for the love of my life And I just ride in from a hard south western drive My lips parched and bloodied My face torn by sand storms and prideI lost ten points just for bein'In the right place at exactly the wrong time I looked right at the facts there But I may as well have been completely blind So if you see me walkin' all alone Don't look back I'm just on my way back home There's a train leaves here this mornin'I don't know what I might be on She signed me to a contract Baby said it would all be so life long Looked around then for a reason When there wasn't somethin' more to blame it on But if time makes a difference while we're gone Tell me now and I won't be hangin' on There's a train leaves here this mornin'I don't know what I might be on Thirteen-Twenty North Columbus Was the address that I'd written down on my sleeve I don't know just what she wanted Might have been that it was gettin' time to leave And I watched as the smoker passed it on And I laughed when the joker said  "Lead on"Cause there's a train leaves here this mornin'I don't know what I might be onIt's a lesson too late for the learning Made of sand, made of sand In the wink of any eye my soul is turning In your hand, in your hand Are you going away with no word of farewell Will there be not a trace left behind Could have loved you better I didn't mean to be unkind You know that was the last thing on my mind As we walk all my thoughts are tumbling Round and round, round and round Underneath my feet the subway is rumbling Underground, underground Are you going away with no word of farewell Will there be not a trace left behind Could have lovеd you better I didn't mean to bе unkind You know that was the last thing on my mind You've got reasons, reasons aplenty for going This I know, this I know For the weeds have been steadily growing Baby please don't go, please don't goOh the whippoorwill roosts on the telephone pole And the Georgia sun goes down Well it's been a long time but I'm glad to say I'm Goin' back down to my home town Goin' down to the Greyhound station Gonna buy me a one way fare Good lord willin' and the creek don't rise By tomorrow I'll be right there Don't it make you want to go home now Don't it make you want to go home All God's children get weary when they roam Don't it make you want to go home But there's a six-lane highway down by the creek Where I went skinny dippin' as a child And a drive-in show wherе the meadow used to grow And strawbеrries used to grow wild There's a drag strip down by the riverside Where my grandma's cow used to graze Now the grass don't grow and the river don't flow Like it did in my childhood days Don't it make you want to go home now Don't it make you want to go home All God's children get weary when they roam Don't it make you want to go home Don't it make you want to go homeYou may be, sweet and nice, but that won't keep you warm at night Cuz I'm the one, who showed you how, to do the things you're doing now He may feel, all your charms, he may hold you in his arms But I'm the one, who let you in, I was right beside you then Once upon a time, you let me feel you deep inside And nobody knew, nobody saw, do you remember the way you cried I'm your toy, I'm your ol' boy But I don't want no one but you to love me I'm your toy, I'm your ol' boy But I don't want no one but you to love me No, I wouldn't lie, you know I'm not that kind of guyThe crops are all in and the peaches are rott'ning The oranges piled in their creosote dumps They're flying 'em back to the Mexican border To pay all their money to wade back again Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye, Rosalita Adios mis amigos, Jesus y Maria You won't have your names when you ride the big airplane All they will call you will be "deportees"My father's own father, he waded that river They took all the money he madе in his life My brothers and sisters comе working the fruit trees And they rode the truck till they took down and died Some of us are illegal, and some are not wanted Our work contract's out and we have to move on Six hundred miles to that Mexican border They chase us like outlaws, like rustlers, like thieves We died in your hills, we died in your deserts We died in your valleys and died on your plains We died 'neath your trees and we died in your bushes Both sides of the river, we died just the same The sky plane caught fire over Los Gatos Canyon A fireball of lightning, and shook all our hills Who are all these friends, all scattered like dry leaves The radio says, "They are just deportees"Is this the best way we can grow our big orchards Is this the best way we can grow our good fruit To fall like dry leaves to rot on my topsoil And be called by no name except "deportees" I was standing by my window On a cold and cloudy day When I saw that hearse come rolling For to take my mother away Will the circle be unbroken By and by Lord by and by There's a better home awaiting In the sky Lord in the sky Well I told the undertaker:Undertaker, won't you please drive slow For that lady that you're hauling Lord I hate to see her go Will the circle...Well I followed close behind her Tried to hold up and be brave But I could not hold my sorrow When they laid her in thе grave Will the circle.
