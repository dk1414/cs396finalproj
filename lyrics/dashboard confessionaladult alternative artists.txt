Breathe in for luck, breathe in so deep This air is blessed, you share with me This night is wild, so calm and dull These hearts, they race, from self control Your legs are smooth as they graze mine We're doing fine, we're doing nothing at all My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me So won't you kill me, so I die happy My heart is yours to fill or burst to break or bury Or wear as jewelry, whichever you prefer The words are hushed, let's not get busted Just lay entwined here, undiscovered Safe in here from all the stupid questions"Hey, did you get some " Man, that is so dumb Stay quiet, stay near, stay close, they can't hear So we can get some My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me So won't you kill me, so I die happy My heart is yours to fill or burst, to break or bury Or wear as jewelry, whichever you preferHope dangles on a string Like slow-spinning redemption Winding in, and winding out The shine of it has caught my eye And roped me in so mesmerizing So hypnotizing I am captivated I am Vindicated, I am selfish, I am wrong I am right, I swear I'm right Swear I knew it all along And I am flawed But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now The things you swore you saw yourself So clear, like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intention Oversized, and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eyeWe were the kids that left home probably too young But we took our share and maybe then some Tired of beatings and battles and being sewn up But that made us grow up, and that made 'em scared'Cause we never learned to keep our voices down No, we only learned to shout So we fight our way in And we fight our way out And we earned what we could from the ground up And tried to lift the whole damn crowd up So we fight our way in And we fight our way out We fight our way in And we fight our way out We fight our way in And we fight our way out And there's still a kid somewhere that needs to hear this That somebody cares, that somebody knows Who's tired of bleeding and battered and being torn up Just pick yourself up, it's time to goI'm missing your bed, I never sleep Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak And this bottle of beast is taking me home I’m cuddling close to blankets and sheets But you’re not alone and you're not discreet Make sure I know who's taking you home I'm reading your note over again There's not a word that I comprehend Except when you signed it "I will love you always and forever"Well, as for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs And sit alone and wonder how you're making out But as for me, I wish that I was anywhere with anyone making out I'm missing your laugh, how did it break And when did your eyes begin to look fake I hope you're as happy as you’re pretending I'm cuddling close to blankets and sheets And I am alone in my defeat I wish I knew you are safely at home I'm missing your bed, I never sleep Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak And this bottle of beast is taking me homeWe watch the season pull up its own stakes And catch the last weekend of the last week Before the gold and the glimmer have been replaced Another sun soaked season fades away You have stolen my heart You have stolen my heart Invitation-only grand farewells Crash the best one of the best ones Clear liquor and cloudy eyed Too early to say goodnight You have stolen my heart You have stolen my heart And from the ballroom floor, we are in celebration One good stretch before our hibernation Our dreams assured, and we all will sleep well Sleep well, sleep well, sleep well, sleep wellGet in the car, I'll drive We got no place to be on time So let's just enjoy the ride We can go wherever the road decides or We can head for the shore Or some place we've never been before Just climb in and close the door We got nothing to answer for'Cause you, you belong with me And I belong with you You belong with me And I belong with you I belong with, I belong with you Reach out and take my hand We got the radio pumpin' jams We don't got no map and we don't got plans We don't gotta follow anyone's demands Feel the wind blowing in your hair The sun on your face and a song in the air We can go as fast as we'll ever dare Until we see tomorrow in the rearview mirrorCome on home and let yourself heal You could sleep for a thousand years I won't let you disappear Let your heart beat here You've been running far and wide Doing what you hope is right Chasing what you feel inside And I will take your path as mine I feel it in my ribs Feel it in my soul The pulse just grows So loud and so clear Let your heart beat here Let your heart beat here Winter's come to take me away I wear my ring to know what's at stake And when the day's work at their own pace You remain my time and place I feel it in my ribs Feel it in my soul The pulse just grows So loud and so clear Let your heart beat here So loud and so clear Let your heart beat here Yeah, let your heart beat hereAnd this is how it starts You take your shoes off in the back of my van Yeah my shirt looks so good When it's just hanging off your back And she said use your hands and my spare time We've got one thing in common, it's this tongue of mine She's got a boyfriend anyway There's only minutes before I drop you off All we seem to do is talk about sex She's got a boyfriend anyway She's got a boyfriend anyway I loved your friend when I saw his film He's got a funny face, but I like that cause he still looks cool She's got a boyfriend anyway She's got a boyfriend anyway Now we're on the bed in my room And I'm about to fill his shoes But you say no You say no Does he take care of you Or could I easily fill his shoes But you say no You say noThe sky glows I see it shining when my eyes close I hear your warnings but we both know I'm gonna look at it again Don't wait, don't wait The road is now a sudden sea And suddenly, you're deep enough To lay your armor down To lay your armor down To lay your armor down Well you get one look I'll show you something that the knife took A bit too early for my own good Now let's not speak of it again Don't wait, don't wait The road is now a sudden sea And suddenly, you're deep enough To lay your armor down To lay your armor down To lay your armor downI went through this door For no other reason than it wasn't open And sometimes I'm foolish Enough to believe encouraging things But most times I'm cautiously less optimistic A face in the crowd I wish to be found I worry so often for those who escape I wonder out loud I sleep at odd hours And I write 'cause I never know just what to say My friends all believe me When I say I'm busy with pretty big things I cancel most plans I hurt someone's feelings I feel like I'm starting And just when I'm starting, I'm starting to stray And everyday, I take a white page And try very hard to know just what to say Just what to say, just what to say I try very hard to know just what to say Just what to say, just what to say
