Uh Yeah, yeah When I was young, I fell in love We used to hold hands, man, that was enough Then we grew up, started to touch Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus I know your daddy didn't like me much And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late She used to meet me on the Eastside In the city where the sun don't set And every day, you know that we'd ride Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight We can go anywhere we want Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea Just take my hand and come with me, yeah We can do anything if we put our minds to it Take your old life, then you put a line through it My love is yours if you're willing to take it Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it So come away, starting today Start a new life together in a different place We know that love is how all these ideas came to be So baby, run away with meEverybody knows my name now But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself And seein' somebody else And everything is not the same now It feels like all our lives have changed Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down But it's killin' me now What if you had it all But nobody to call Maybe then you'd know me'Cause I've had everything But no one's listening And that's just fuckin' lonely I'm so lo-o-o-onely Lo-o-o-onely Everybody knows my past now Like my house was always made of glass And maybe that's the price you pay For the money and fame at an early age And everybody saw me sick And it felt like no one gave a shit They criticized the things I did as an idiot kidAyy, ayy, uh Roses are red, violets are blue My heart is dead, I'm such a fool Why did I fall for you I gave it all for you Roses are red , violets are blue My heart is dead , I'm such a fool Why did I fall for you I gave it all for you Feelin' lost, don't know what to do
