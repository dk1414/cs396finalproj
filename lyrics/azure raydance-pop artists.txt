Fill these spaces up with days In my room You can go, you can stay I can't sleep I can't speak to you I can't sleep Now these years locked in my drawer I'll open to see Just to be sure I can't sleep I can't speak to you I can't sleep And so I'm reaching out for the one And so I've learned the meaning of the sun And all this like a message comes To shift my point of view I'm watching through my own light As it tints the shade of you Hold my wine, hold it in Nobody's lost But nobody winsIt's just a simple line I can still hear it all of the time If I can just hold on tonight I'll know that nothing Nothing survives Nothing survives I think I'm turned around I'm looking up not looking down And when I'm standing still Watching you run Watching you fall Fall into me Am I making something worthwhile out of this place Am I making something worthwhile out of this chase I am displaced, I am displaced And she's my friend of all friends She's still here when everyone's gone She doesn't have to say a thing We'll just keep laughing All night long All night long Am I making something worthwhile out of this place Am I making something worthwhile out of this chase I am displaced, I am displacedToday I'll crawl out of bed I can't stand, your shadow is to heavy to lift Maybe we'll go for a ride You said you'd take me nowhere I said that suits me just fine I know you've always been near Whispering secrets I know I'm not supposed to hear Hold your heart with two hands Give it to me only to disappear And look how low I've sunk Don't ask me to rise I'll lose you when I'm high Hey, look how low I've sunk Don't ask me to rise I'll only lose you when I'm High All alone in the dark Love survives only when we are apart Your voice still sounds in my ears Soft explosions that blossom with the beat of my heart And look how low I've sunk Don't ask me to rise I'll lose you when I'm high Hey, look how low I've sunk Don't ask me to rise I'll only lose you when I'm High HighYou could go anywhere anytime and find someone But how will you know if he's kind The sun is out but happiness Only reminds you of the people you hurt Mistakes that you made when you were down And where are you now You're sweeping up these sorry streets And I knew somehow When you looked up and over me That you could look up these words But you still won't understand They mean nothing to you So write them in the sand And watch the water wash them away And where are you now You're sweeping up these sorry streets And I knew somehow When you looked up and over me But you could sit on your front porch And watch the moths dive down You could go out every night And force cheap beer down You could go all day And not make a sound You could go all day And not make a soundSo I'm waiting for this test to end So these lighter days can soon begin I'll be alone but maybe more carefree Like a kite that floats so effortlessly I was afraid to be alone But now I'm scared that's how I like to be All these faces run the same How can there be so many personalities So many lifeless, empty hands So many hearts in great demand And now my sorrow seems so far away Until I'm taken by these bolts of pain But I turn them off, and tuck them away Until those rainy days that make them stay And then I'll cry so hard to these sad songs And the words still ring, once here, now gone And they echo through my head everyday And I don't think they'll ever go away Just like thinking of your childhood home But we can't go back, we're on our own, ohWith every word I live again through the eyes of another We'll meet at night, wet from the rain and surprise each other With how we take away the pain Could you be the one to find me safe and sound Love is how it's lost not how it's found I don't know those eyes but I see beauty there always I know it's wrong to love you from afar but it's a craze You recognize my pain Could you be the one to find me safe and sound Love is how it's lost not how it's found Love is how it's lost not how it's found I'll take away your pain Could you be the one to find me safe and sound Love is how it's lost not how it's found Love is how it's lost not how it's found Love is when I'm lost not when I'm foundLet's talk and we'll fill the air The imagery that lasts forever So this is love and that's a lovely thought You have to care for it to keep it together And if you fall, will you get up Stuck in a dream, will you wake up And if you've found love will you hold on to it And if it's cold, will you stay warm Drift too far, will you swim towards the shore If you've found love will you hold on to it Let's just sing and we'll fill the air The melodies that blend together I speak so sweet of words so delicate A glass I hope will never shatter And if you fall, will you get up Stuck in a dream, will you wake up And if you've found love will you hold on to it And if it's cold, will you stay warm Drift too far, will you swim towards the shore If you've found love will you hold on to itNow I've traveled across the ocean With the same shoes just longer hair Still carry that picture in my wallet From the photo booth, yeah it's still there Just give me some kind of sign Is this the right place Or the right time Is this the right time And now I've landed in the Midwest Where you lived so long ago Remember I was always freezing And now I'm covered up in snow Just give me some kind of sign Is this the right place Or the right time Is this the right time Standing in front of you They fade into the wall And leave behind nothing Nothing at all I know I don't understand how they forget How some will just pass us by And take what they can get I know I don't understand how weightless they must be Without feeling Without feeling Without feeling Grasping with my fingernails As they tear through your skin Leaving no signs of pain No wounds to mend I know I don't understand how they forget How some will just pass us by And take what they can get I know I don't understand how weightless they must be Without feeling Without feeling Without feelingFollow blind Heavy eyes hold position Right on time It was a lucky prediction Move on, move on It's like the clock is pacing The break of dawn and our hearts are racing Move on, move on There's nothing changing Don't undermine My new resolution Just to find Different light a new direction Move on, move on Now the records skipping I won't forget, I won't forget the way you said Move on, move on There's no point in waiting
