Tell me now, if you came sneakin' up behind Would you know me and see behind the smile I can change like colors on a wall Hopin' no one else will find what lies beneath it all I think I hide it all so well Steppin' out, everyone can see my face All the things I can't erase from my life everybody knows Standin' out so you won't forget my name That's the way we play this game of life Everybody knows Lookin' through the crowd, I search for someone else But every time I turn around, I run into myself Here I stand, consumed by my surroundings Just another day of everybody looking I swore they'd never see me cry Never see me cry Steppin' out, everyone can see my face All the things I can't erase from my life everybody knows Standin' out so you won't forget my name That's the way we play this game of life Everybody knowsAside the wandering eye has opened A stare all the way bare and broken The start of a brand-new adventure Hey now Catch me quick before I walk away Tell me if there's something I should say I'll find the quiet corners and the empty spaces Not far a blue guitar is playing It drew me like it knew And it's saying Hey now Catch me quick before I walk away Tell me if there's something I should say I'll find the quiet corners and the empty spaces We drown in ups and downs, neglecting The beauty of my sun is setting In the end, there's no way in redemptionWhere have all my friends gone They've all disappeared Turned around maybe one day You're all that was there Stood by unbelieving Stood by on my own Always thought I was someone Turned out I was wrong You brought me through And you made me feel So blue Why don't you Stay behind So blue Why don't you stop And look at what's going down Lived by an old woman She'd never sell me a lie It's hard to sing with someone Who won't sing with you Give all of my mercy Give all of my heart Never thought that I'd miss you That I'd miss you so muchThere's gonna be roses And your picture in a frame The women will be cryin' and the men, they will whisper your name Umbrellas will be open On a hillside of graves The children will be dressed up and chase each other in the rain And there's gonna be a darkness It may be colder than you guessed There may not be music, there may not be stairs There may not be angels fillin' the air Your mother may be there Your father may be there There may not be voices sent from a throne To carry you home Now Heaven may not get you The Devil may see you first He's hittin' himself in both The beast and the birth A stranger may have found you Where the angels have lulled you to sleep They swallow you whole Like a whale from your head to your feetPretty little hairdo Don't do what it used to Can't disguise the living All the miles that you've been through Looking like a train wreck Wearing too much makeup The burden that you carry More than one soul could ever bear Don't look so sad, Marina There's another part to play Don't look so sad, Marina Save it for a rainy day Save it for a rainy day Save it for a rainy day You never make your mind up Like driving with your eyes shut Rough around the edges Won't someone come and take you home Waiting for a breakthrough What will you set your mind to We stood outside the Chinese restaurant In the rainThe words that you said They still ring in my head Don't you know We say goodbye With a tear in our eye Oh, where'd you go It's alright, you can sleep tonight Knowing you'll always live on In a song Farewell to old friends Let's raise a glass to the bitter end Farewell to old friends Will you be the same when we see you again Remember the days When we'd laugh as you played Who would have known The water would come And just take you away Oh, where'd you go I was waiting for the sun Then I walked on home alone But what I didn't know Was he was waiting for you to fall So I never made amends For the sake of no one else And for the simple reason That he was waiting for you to fall It was not lost on me It was not lost on me Walking on down the road Looking for a friend to hang out Somebody's my soul So I kept my spirits high Entertaining passers-by Wrapped in my confusion While he was waiting for you to fallBoarded windows, rusty stairs Local color push their wares They're stuck in their ways You tell me that you just don't care Don't pretend that you don't care Waves of undulating grain Visible from the little train Where you slept Sorry that I ripped your dress Sorry that I ripped your dress Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh You're already gone This house ain't a home I'll take the last flight I stare at my hands We'll make our last stand I'm leavin' Detroit The pushin' billboards, fast food chains Tires whining softly in the rain On the outskirts of town What it is that I don't got Who it is that I'm notI promise this: I'll never take you for granted Without a kiss, I knew you're all that I wanted You walked into the room, and in a word, you owned it I couldn't move, I was locked into the moment Oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa Oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa And from the stage, it was like the heavens opened I felt the world shiftin' gears into slow motion You justified a dream I always carried with me Just when I'd given up, your love swooped in to lift me up Oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa Oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa Oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa Oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa Don't be afraid when the waves get too tall Or when this noisy world makes you feel small I'll be there to carry you to safetyWhen you're down Crawlin' out your window And you can't seem to stay In one place We've been thinkin''Bout better days We've been drinkin'Smiles away I, I don't wanna love you, but I'll try Try to stay away from you next time I love backwards women In the pool halls underneath The neon sun I've been wasted On the run I've been chasin'Troubled ones
