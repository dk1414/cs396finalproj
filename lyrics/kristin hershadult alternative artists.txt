If I walk down this hallway Tonight it's too quiet So I pad through the dark And call you on the phone Push your old numbers And let your house ring'Till I wake your ghost Let him walk down your hallway It's not this quiet Slide down your receiver Stand across the wire Follow my number Slide into my hand It's the blaze across my nightgown It's the phone's ring Chorus:I think last night You were driving circles around me You were driving circles around me You were driving circles around me I can't drink this coffee Till I put you in my closet Let him shoot me down Let him call me off I take it from his whisper You're not that toughYou know how it feels when the real world encroaches Rubbing elbows with the unemployed and you You're so beautiful You're so rude Peeling mangos on a fold out couch I'm scooped out You're inscrutable You're all mine Swimming is a 'lude Wine opens your mind Your guitar's a race car Sex is your best friend What's your dirty answer My fantasies are unlived histories You know what it's like when mistakes go unmade It was beautiful It was you I'm giving up the ugly I thought you'd make pretty I'll be goddamned This is beautiful Hold my hand Swimming is a 'lude Wine opens your mind Your guitar's a race car Sex is your best friend What's your dirty answer  It was feast or famine That day plus a life of the same So we made a pact, we're moving back And moving back in time And moving back in time Sleeping with angels is no way to live But riding thermals weâ€™re basically good I held out the longest, I think Waiting for the noise to stop Probably should have been the first to go Definitely should have been the first to go No shade in shadow No shade in shadow No shade in shadow No shade in shadow No shade in shadow No shade in shadow No shade in shadow No shade in shadowOh no, don't you put me in that box You know what you can do with those locks Bet your life I'll come crawling out again You'll have to deal with me then You'll hear me in the wind I've been on the other side of the Blue Ridge Seen the Shenandoah rolling there I stepped off the mountains edge Just to climb the golden stair I seen the streets up there I been on the mount transfiguration Been there with my Ma and my Pa On the mountain of commandment I been handed down the law You should have seen what I saw I fell to the bottom of Thales' well Caught like a thief with a lamb You know these stars they can cast a spell I've been caught with red hands I've been caught with red hands I scaled the mountains, skiied the valleys I've done the highs and the lows I don't feel like work today Hell I won't go Bess I won't goBy now, I should know where you're going By now I should but I don't You're better off wherever you are off to Agile or stoned By now, I should wake you when I'm hungry Right now I should but I'm not We could be a silkworm tightrope We could but we're not I don't want this to be over You're what I do Every day the only thing That makes any sense Your liver twisting logic's Far and away the smartest thing I don't know where I am Plus I don't know when I am'cause you insist on using fucked up military time'cause you are better off alone I've been right here for 37 hours I dropped a cigarette in my shoe And dove in the water Then I swam until my hair dreaded Like flying on fireOh the cuckoo she's a pretty bird She wobbles when she flies She don't ever holler cuckoo Till the fourth day of July Jack of diamonds Jack of diamonds I know you of old You rob my poor pockets of silver and gold Oh the cuckoo she's a pretty bird I wish that she was mine She don't ever drink water She only drinks wine Gonna build me a log cabin On a mountain so high So I can see willy When he goes on by Oh the cuckoo she's a pretty bird She wobbles when she flies She don't ever holler cuckoo Till the fourth day of JulyIt was all passion misunderstood All passion mislaid I'm on a mission by mistake And I hate it I lost every friend I ever made But I like it too much I like it too much I like it And junkie hearts are broken How many times can you get fucked in How many different ways You separate the good guys from disaster And it's even sadder I lost every hope I ever had Cause I like it too much I like it too much I like it And junkie hearts are broken Sand stings your face and I wanted you back Your shell Starts to crack Fits you like a glove Sand stings your face and I wanted you back Your heart's Out of whack It's you under a spell Under a spell for a change It's you Under a spell for a change It's you Under a spell for a changeChinese food and your sleeping bag We're born-again losers It's funny Honey, you know, this is not so bad Hanging around, wired for sound It's funny And sad and it's true I'm aching Aching for you We carry an island around on our backs We're born-again vagrants It's funny And we ask for nothing wherever we land Meanwhile, we got nothing Isn't that something It's funny And sad and it's true I'm aching Aching for you Wailing in the garage Breaking all the rules And I don't need you You know you're truly bizarre You're changing all the rules And I don't need you But I want you bad We're all I ever had Love is a needle, goes all the way down I'm always surprised It's funny So shoot me a roll of your best paradise It's so pretty I just want to die It's funny And sad and it's true I'm aching Aching for you It's funny I'm aching for youI lost a boy And now I look for him Through every window And behind every door My son went down This isn't trauma It's not even drama anymore I was born With a sad song in my mouth He gave me a reason to sing it It's like this boy Took all my clear cold nights Left me hot and dry And when he falls I can't hear it This isnt vodka It's not even chocolate I don't know how long I can stay straight And still see straight He gave me a reason to say it Don't wait for pain To find out you exist Don't look for shame You're better off without it Life is unkindA man made of butterfat Careening around on a Sno-Cat And I can't drive any faster My hands are like ice and the moon shines On pepper trees and road grease The yellow lines look blue Snow buries Whitehall White powdered Nembutal And I can't think any more My feet are like ice As the moon sets On Christmas trees and plastic deer I decided to forgive and forget I thank god you're comatose As I pull back the bedclothes And I can't believe my composure And I can't remember my anger And summer is a fish story I wonder where we'll be
