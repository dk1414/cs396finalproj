Cracked pane Light ridden Dust sheets Wrecked cunt Wax Christ hid his eyes Sex The golden seed And god is well hung We are the virgin tree And I am the tree Ha ha Oh my love Kill me here Before I wake Know your true Who could know Aborted bride Lost my friend Bought a cat Drank too much Spilled my soul You'll not be anything but happy happy happy…Face the dawn With half closed eyes Bloodshot eyes don't close like yours do Buy a drink We've both been there Bloodshot eyes don't close no more Bloodshot eyes don't close like yours doTwo birds met in a tree And for a second the world vanishes Diverts the eye beams to the subconscious From the plasma universe Like all she ever wanted to be was written in sand Long lost on a planet Sweet the sleep that comes to the opening eye Sand on sand and facts on file The tranquility sea of the moon is on fire Books on mechanics say nothing of I And the things they're telling her are total lies…She regrets not having a lucid life She never expected the fortune you feel that you deserve I caught her crawling out a window The front door was wide open The past is receding beyond control Each hour is a brick in the wall A brick for each hour The echoes of the saddest things are lurched in the stoneThistle Lurid Black lunged abortive mother One leg in a mermaid; head full of snow And half drunk promises Her offspring Wayward domestic rats; impeding tourists Overfed American rotten beef brain Made independently wealthy Building closets for the insane And terminally committable And terminally committable And terminally committable Rats  rats!Rats  rats!We're a new generation Of lurid sinner saints birthed from red hot cunts-of-flame To torch the world With madness and purity A new generation Of lurid sinner saints birthed from red hot cunts-of-flame To torch the world With madness and purity A new generation Of lurid sinner saints birthed from red hot cunts-of-flame To torch the world With madness and purity Madness and purity AnewThe Violet stems of strangling premonitions You said something in your sleep and turned toward the wall A second skin of sweat in a thickening snowstorm of horrible words And I am sure they are not mine I'll take you to terrible parties where nothing but angst is served Exploding match head gossips You're not there when the smoke clears the room Suicide not written in lipstick Badly spelt apology You're singing songs to your vodka"There's no one but you and me"Above your head a girl on a tightwire is holding a parasol She dances in the gloom She's got a smile and no expectations And tricks up her skirt we're sure you'll adore…Since when has there been a way out of the trap we set for you And you thought that you knew usOur mary is veiled in blue Slitting her throat with a crude razor I'm watching her sick for days in the twilight sleep They're feeding me cobwebs They're keeping me silent I'm in a black mood I'm in a very black mood And I've watched Mary for days Running through fields Fields of black ashes She's in white and always in shadow The skies fill with locusts from blue mountains They're in my throat…Michael is in the corner talking to rabbits that don't exist It puts me in a black mood We're mad as hell hounds Laughing like jackals chasing after cars I keep my books in cages because they will bite me if I let them out And Michael looks at me His eyes all white The cuts on my arms open like tiny mouths Vomit blood And he stares But what do you expect from a boy who talks to rabbits that don't even exist I could lie here for days watching Mary She stamped "Evidence" in red all over everything I doBored in a city of excess The mirror captures his spine Curved like a sickle in excess Self pity, his faults become my own He vomits endlessly into our carpet Something in it is shining My eyes are pools of blood I don't turn to look at him He's burnt out matchsticks He leaves blisters A map of the lost doesn't have him on it Scars I dreamt disappear upon walking We're walking broken soldiers in the city we destroyed He doesn't believe in ghosts but he looks in the mirror The map of the lost finds him right hereSome gray cityline Or a rooftop gasping for fire Just something that burns Give you anything to take the edge off…Some skin to cover the nerves Way below in the thorns In a maze no one admits to making me chase like virgins with scissors Cutting down anything that moves Or that seems as a way to the edge What pretty flowers!They'll never rotThe briny smell of tears runs through the ship That moves unseen through streets Like a charcoal smudge in moonlight shadow Creaking salt oars row thin air Oblivious to the streets not seas Green mossed Slick bellied Ship of dreams Stagnant street Tide pools that scream morning after starfish Like some dreamers' castle from mute rocks of sleep To lie on stones and still pray to wake No way home…Ghost ship walked by Silent crew Dead eyes leer at black windows Never see and ever long For the way out of endless dark streets Leaving behind them the scent of mermaid tears Tears that dry before they reach Dreamers cast from mute rock sleep To lie on stones and still pray to wake Which way is home
