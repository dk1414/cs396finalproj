I can't think of one reason I like the things I do I take a ride on a good feeling Knowing it'll see me through Like a drive down a dusty highway After the sun's gone down Chasing shadows into the new day Leavin' this lonely town I'm gonna rock, ride nothing to hide Let the headlights guide me I'm gonna roll right into the night Take the midnight highway Midnight highway I knew a girl, now she's a woman We used to watch the road at night Dream about where the road could take us Counting all the red taillights Now she stands at the kitchen window Staring at the old highway There's still a girl inside the woman If you listen you can hear her say I'm gonna rock, ride nothing to hide Let the headlights guide me I'm gonna roll right into the night Take the midnight highway Midnight highwayIt's a cold night for alligators It's a cold night for dogs The dogs choke on their barking When they see alligator persons In the bar head fall It's a cold night for alligators When men turn into them in the night It's a cold night for alligators It's a cold night for their might It's a cold night for alligators Hiding behind the trees and moss Forever hear the swampers screaming They forever have lost It's a cold night for alligators In the blender It's a cold night for alligators A perfect monster has no endEvery step Takes me closer to the rise Running high, I close my eyes Oh, baby Passing days I go stronger than before And this hunger holds the score To my dreaming Can't stop, one shot Got to stand up Holding to this feeling got to give me the chance to fly Shoot for the top One like a winner Shoot for the top Reach for your dreams Oh, take a look At the fire in my eyes The desires burning high No lying I don't care Though I might have lost my mind Got to leave thesе fears behind And waningWhen I see her walking down the street I get so shaky and I feel so weak I tell my eyes look the other way But they don't listen to a word I say And I, I go to pieces and I wanna cry I go to pieces and I almost die Every time my baby passes by I tell my arms they'll hold someone new Another love that will be true But they don't listen, they don't seem to care They reach for her but she's not there And I, I go to pieces and I wanna cry I go to pieces and I almost die Every time my baby passes by Well I remember what she said when she said"Goodbye baby, we'll meet again soon maybe Well but until we do, all my best to you"I'm so lonely, I think about her onlyAnyway the wind blows Anyway the wind blows Back when we were wild and ready On the edge of a dust bowl city Cadillac rollin steady Anyway the wind blows Life was an infinite number Livin one day to another Lookin for the end of summer And we can't see around the bend We never know where the road might end We just go any way the wind blows Burnin both ends of the candle Can't worry bout the things that we don't know Going just as fast as we can go Anyway the wind blows Doesn't matter if we lead or follow No telling where we'll be tomorrow Goin somewhere, goin full throttle Anyway the wind blows And we don't know what lies in store But still we walk through that open door We just go anyway the wind blowsI'm not much on mystery, yeah You gotta be careful what you dream I thought I was satisfied I thought love would pass in time Honey, let me tell you I got a thing about you Baby let me tell you I got a thing about you It don't matter what you say It don't matter what you do I, I, I, got a thing about you I, I, I, got a thing about you Somewhere deep in the middle of the night Lovers hold each other tight Whisper in their anxious ears Words of love that disappear Honey, let me tell you I got a thing about you Baby let me tell you I got a thing about you It don't matter what you say It don't matter what you do I, I, I, got a thing about you I, I, I, got a thing about youI can't think of one reason I like the things I do I take a ride on a good feeling Knowing it'll see me through Like a drive down a
