some kind of way out of here"Said the joker to the thief"There's too much confusion I can't get no relief Businessmen they drink my wine Plowmen dig my earth None will level on the line Nobody offered his word"Hey!"No reason to get excited"The thief, he kindly spoke"There are many here among us Who feel that life is but a joke But, uh, but you and I, we've been through that And this is not our fate So let us stop talkin' falsely now The hour's getting late Hey!Hey Well she's walking, through the clouds With a circus mind that's running round Butterflies and zebras And moonbeams And-a, fairytales That's all she ever thinks about Riding with the wind When I'm sad, she comes to me With a thousand smiles she gives to me free It's alright, she said, it's alright Take anything you want from me Anything, anything Fly on, little wing Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, little wingAnger, he smiles Towering in shiny metallic purple armor Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted They quietly understand Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready But wonder why the fight is on But they're all bold as love Yeah, they're all bold as love Yeah, they're all bold as love Just ask the axis My red is so confident he flashes trophies of war And ribbons of euphoria Orange is young, full of daring But very unsteady for the first go 'round My yellow in this case is not so mellow In fact, I'm trying to say it's frightened like me And all of these emotions of mine keeps holding me from Giving my life to a rainbow like you But I'm uh, yeah, l'm bold as love Yeah, yeah, well I'm bold, bold as love Hear me talking, girl I'm bold as love Just ask the axis He knows everything Yeah, yeah, yeah YeahWell, I stand up next to a mountain And I chop it down with the edge of my hand Well, I stand up next to a mountain And I chop it down with the edge of my hand Well, I pick up all the pieces and make an island Might even raise a little sand Yeah Because I'm a voodoo child Lord knows I'm a voodoo child, baby I want to say one more last thing I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time I'll give it right back to ya one of these days, hahah I said, I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time I'll give it right back one of these days, oh yeah If I don't meet you no more in this world Then I'll meet you in the next one And don't be late Don't be lateDown the street you can hear her scream "You're a disgrace"As she slams the door in his drunken face And now he stands outside And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool He cries "Oh girl, you must be mad What happened to the sweet love you and me had "Against the door he leans and starts a scene And his tears fall and burn the garden green And so castles made of sand Fall in the sea eventually A little Indian brave who before he was ten Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends And he built a dream that when he grew up He would be a fearless warrior, Indian Chief Many moons passed, and more the dream grew strong Until tomorrow he would sing his first war song And fight his first battle But something went wrong Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night And so castles made of sand Melts into the sea eventuallyHey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand Hey Joe, I said, where you going with that gun in your hand I'm going down to shoot my old lady You know, I caught her messing around with another man I'm going down to shoot my old lady You know, I caught her messing around with

sun refused to shine I don't mind, I don't mind If the mountains fell in the sea Let it be, it ain't me, I got my own world to look through And uh, I ain't gonna copy you, yeah Now if a 6 turned out to be 9 I don't mind, I don't mind, If all the hippies cut off all their hair I don't care, I don't care Dig, cause I got my own world to live through And uh, and I ain't going to copy you White-collared conservatives Flashing down the street Pointing their plastic finger at me They're hoping soon, my kind will drop and die But I'm going to wave My freak flag high, high ow After all the jacks are in their boxes And the clowns have all gone to bed You can hear happiness staggering on down the street Footprints dressed in red And the wind whispers Mary A broom is drearily sweeping Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life Somewhere a queen is weeping Somewhere a king has no wife And the wind it cries Mary The traffic lights they turn blue tomorrow And shine their emptiness down on my bed The tiny island sags downstream'Cause the life they lived is dead And the wind screams Mary Will the wind ever remember The names it has blown in the past And with its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom It whispers no, this will be the last And the wind cries MaryManic depression is searching my soul I know what I want, but I just don't know How to, go about getting it Feeling, sweet feeling Drops from my Fender's, fingers Manic depression is capturing my soul Yeah Woman so willing, the sweet cause in vain You make love, you break love It's all the same When it's, when it's over, mama Music, sweet music I wish I could caress, caress, caress Manic depression is a frustrating mess Well, I think I'll go turn myself off and go on down All the way down Really ain't no use in me hanging around In your kind of scene Music, sweet music I wish I could caress, and kiss, kiss Manic depression is a frustrating mess
