I am stuck with someone, we're not communicating I want to buy I need consoling I need something new Something trivial would do I want to satisfy this empty feeling Walking down the street looking in the windows The T V, the lights flickering in other peoples windows Imagine myself moving in the kitchens Somehow I don't know, it just looks so tempting I want to buy I need consoling I need something new Something trivial would do I want to satisfy this empty feelingI knew you were sitting in your room all alone I knew I was the only girl for you You have told me so But somehow it slipped my mind Whilst walking home Whilst you were sulking I could have been raped In Ladbroke Grove Well you can have your records back And take your comics too I'm going to have some fun tonight Life's better without you So I spend an evening Without getting my face cut And another evening Without getting run over Again another evening without falling in love So I listen to the radio Smoke a cigarette Same old thing, yeah I know Everybody does it Six months Have passed, now try become between us I never missed you, only sometimes Dreaming on a bus There is absolutely no doubt in my mind That you and I have grown apart For the first time Seeing you with other girls Sometimes bothers me But I don't want to play those games They're just not interestingBabylon love us...oh Babylon love
