Slip from the trees to the dirt to the menace To the wild to the car, under snow, cut to ribbons Like a coral to your shin, like a manacle to swing Fresh from the breast, now a river running fat To the manor born a rat, to the manor born a flea To a flood to a drain, now a rubber, now a chain I was in the war You were in the war Plump from the sugar-water pump With the city at your back to the cannon with a match From a milk into a mass grave Never mind that, I can take that Bones in a bowl like a toad-in-the-hole Take the shape of the mould Like a mummy on a pole and a merry little head Bob around when you're dead I was on my knees You were on your kneesDrag my tongue across the sand So happy just to crawl across the land Soon I'll be the best around I'm gonna keep my plunder underground Hard flesh, cold against the rain Dust billowing around my brazen brain Saw off all my stinking limbs Blood dripping down my sunken monkey chin Baby, can you leave it in the ?Baby, can you leave it in the ?Girl, I'm from the very, very Girl, I'm from the very, very Baby, can you leave me in the ?Baby, can you leave me in the ?Girl, I wanna take you to the Girl, I wanna take you to the Take me to the distant past, I want to go back Save me from the distant past, I want this so bad Take me to the distant past, I want to go back Save me from the distant past, I want this so badYou can tell the past, boy, I can tell the future Give me a lobotomy and I can be your tutor Open up the blast doors, then we can be neutered I can smell your fingerprints all over my computer So give me all the black-brown, sticky sugar water Swing you by your neck, mama, this can be your future Something very strange about your picture in the mirror When you move, it doesn't move, now how could that be weirder Just keep on rubbernecking, yeah, whatever feels familiar I can send my brain on a holiday forever You can fire a rocket at a rocket, it's the future If you weren't already dead, I wouldn't have to school ya You say you're gonna change, yeah But you don't have any time, yeah Down in my beast heart, I build an empire Whenever I'm blind, I open my wild eye Down in my beast heart, I build an empire Whenever I'm blind, I open my wild eye Go tell it to the plain-clothed officer behind us What are you, a master of disguise and keeping silent Drop another depth charge, coiling like a viper Eyes so close together make it harder for the sniper Shoot a starving porno for the yuppies in a circle Second death upon you, swimming backwards like a turtle Man, I really trusted you, I thought you were civilian I could shove a magnet in your mouth and make a million So did you pack your bag, or did somebody pack it for you Take me to the sad, sad party that you're bound to Whether you're a 'have-not' or a 'have', I got a question Are you living dead, or is this some kind of possession So you think there's no meaning In anything that we do Maybe it's the silence Maybe it's the war Try to understand it Try your best to understand the world You're bleeding down the highway You just want to listen to the road Well, you called him a liar And you called him a piece of dirt And never can you take it back and Never can you make it right In the final seconds I think he knew everything you are A plague on the horizon In the cold arena where you're Trapped In the moment you met In the lifetime alive What you said wasn't loud enough, but you did know how Ooh You can take it from me There's a light in your eyes There's a thing that you're always saying and it is no wordsNo making it easy now No making excuses now No matter whose bomb's on your bus They're making examples of us Fuck your brother on your helipad If he's dead, he's not a deadbeat dad I told you I'm a highwayman But your money isn't worth a damn I'm coming in, cleaved in two You're coming up, steamed right through What happens to the gene pool now Keep talking, but it won't come out Still learning how to walk, how to speak Still learning how to use your beak Still working on Maggie's farm Still wanking with a robot arm I'm checking your name off my list I'm checking your name off my list I'm making up a reason to exist I'm checking your name off my list You're thinking that your wife is worth a lot I'm telling you your life is worth a yacht No matter whose knife in the dark No matter whose A holy man with a pale, yellow liver Crossed my palm on the banks of the river On the banks of the river The hands loom heavy with only an hour to go I hold my breath but the seekers will find me Priest and pauper, the leper, uh Can't change his spots, the King knows, and I know it, eh And everybody knows Spring, sun, winter, dread I don't want to get older Spring, sun, winter, dread I don't want to get older Are those my people, or are they barbarians all I need a shoulder to talk to about it Swing the hammer, the fragments, eh A skull exploded on you, on all you And showers on the infant's bed Spring, sun, winter, dread I don't want to get older Spring, sun, winter, dread I don't want to get older Spring, sun, winter, dread I don't want to get older Spring, sun, winter, dread I don't want to get older We got ourselves another one We got ourselves another Jane Doe,  Doe I never let the others go But every time I look around they  form See the shadow-men bow down to The head of a baby calf, calf If it isn't love then why do I feel that I'm split in half, half, half, half Babe, don't look the other way I love your face and there's no more time Babe, I saw what you did tonight It's ugly but it is all I want Babe, they call me the medicine man But my old spells don't work anymore Don't ask for me tomorrow, kid I think you'll only find a grave man,  man Just take a look outside the walls And try to tell me something that's good  now 'Round my neck I feel some great weight The Chupacabra clings on, on That's the rhythm my Pigdog loves It's gotta mean something's wrong, wrong, wrong, wrongHold me on this night of the long knives Hold me on this night of the long knives It's coming Shame about your neighbourhood It's coming Shame about your neighbourhood There's a flood on the street, there's a tide and it's coming in now Yet the concrete burns at the back of your skull And they say it's a wave but it feels like a dribbling mouth There's a light bulb flicker but it never goes on Yes, the bomb may be falling, if it lands where you're stood Man, I know it's a real big shame about your neighbourhood I'm the wrong kind of people, why'd you listen to me Just the island a-breathing in and out and It was a long time coming It was a long time coming It's coming Shame about your neighbourhood It's coming Shame about your neighbourhoodRegret, regret Regret, regret First you'll see me on the news Then never again I'm rolling in my grave Feeling like a grenade Maybe you're the coldest If you've never felt it Maybe you're the luckiest If you never did it But did you imagine it In a different way Did you imagine it In a different way Did you ever watch your life Slide out of your hands  You wish it never had But all of that's in the past Maybe I'm a human The "trying to click 'undo' man" Or maybe an automaton Oh, how'd it all go so wrong  Out in the cold There’s an old man laying down in the flames tonight Smiling to me And he whistles as they’re sweeping him up, alright Like: *whistles*I hear them praying There’s bodies in the road Where nothing else will grow I’m thinking, "What was my password "As the vultures land Crushed under feet How about we find some nice place to eat tonight Teeth on a wire I made a necklace for you, just you and I, alright Like ee-ee, ee-ee, ee-ee, ee-ee, ee-ee, ee-ee-ee-ee Ee-ee, ee-ee, ee-ee, ee-ee, ee-ee, ee-ee Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
