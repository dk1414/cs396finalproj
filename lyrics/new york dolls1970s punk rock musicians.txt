back in the States I was stranded in the jungle, afraid, alone Trying to figure a way to get a message back home But how was I to know that the wreckage of my plane Had been picked up and spotted and my girl in lover's lane Meanwhile, back in the States Baby, baby, let's make romance You know your old-time lover hasn't got a chance He's stranded in the jungle, sad as he can be So come on, pretty baby, just you and me Meanwhile, back in the jungle The boys in the jungle had me on the run When something heavy hit me like an atomic bomb When I woke up and my head started to clear I had a strange feeling I was cooking gear I smelled something cooking and I looked to see That's when I found out they was cookin' me Ooga booga, lemme outta here Meanwhile, back in the StatesSomething must have happened over Manhattan Who can expound all the children this time Did they ever, could they ever Expect such a Frankenstein, a Frankenstein I remember when you were children You were better than any man There was never nothing you would ever understand But you knew who was there to be your master Making his demands and plans Whose always making his plans And when those plans they don't fit your style You get a feeling of your own ordeal That's when he starts calling you, wow Bud, you just don't know what to do So now you come around here And you're trying to take over the town Just because of back home, baby How he puts you down Oh, baby, how he puts you down I know they put you down So now, you're off starting 'round here Here you ask and demand In a place where they don't expect nothing You're trying not to dirty your hands When asking you as a person Is it a crime, is it a crime For you to fall in love with FrankensteinI always saw you, just before the dawn When all the other kids, were just dragging along I couldn't believe the way it seemed to be Remembering the things, you used to say to me You know I can't be wasting time Cause I gotta have my fun-I gotta get some fun I gotta to keep on moving Can't stop till it's all done And I'm never done Listen when I tell ya, you got no time for fits Cause I just gotta make it, can't afford to miss And there's one reason, I'm telling you this I feels bad....And I'm a looking for a kiss Well, wontcha tell me why those kids are moving so slow Is it that they just don't have a place to go When the day starts
