The idea came from the Government so as you would expect The reason never was to help nor was it to protect With the subtlety of an elephant they started through their lists Filled with east targets where their aim just couldn't miss CS A C SA Whose life will you screw up today In your cold and calculating way CS A C SA Accounting vultures of dismay How many more lives must be lost to earn your pay Rip up all prior agreements where there never was complaint They track you down and badger you with legal restraint While women who would welcome help find their applications ignored Is there anyone other than Government better off than before C SA C SA Whose life will you screw up today In your cold and calculating way CS A C SA Accounting vultures of dismay How many more lives must be lost to earn your pay The idea came from the Government so as you would expect The reason never was to help nor was it to protect With the subtlety of an elephant they started through their lists Filled with east targets where their aim just couldn't missNations saw it coming the signs were there Nobody listened nobody cared People demonstrated again and again Every warning was all in vain Sirens rang out the outcome was clear Death and destruction was drawing near Mankind destroyed with nuclear know how Wasted lives no tears to flow Try to get home, run for your life A few may live but millions will die Pushing and jostling all wasting time As the bombs drop slowly from the sky Blinding light makes the eyes go blank Split second later shock wave attack Flеsh in the street laying burned and charred Millions massacrеd no time to laugh Show of strength that went too far Superpowers overstepped the mark Declared in a minute and finished in five Ordinary people suffered with their lives Nations saw it coming the signs were there Nobody listened nobody cared People demonstrated again and again Every warning was all in vain Show of strength that went too far Superpowers overstepped the mark Declared in a minute and finished in five Ordinary people suffered with their livesI'm a rabbit confused and scared They're testing cosmetics for your hair My eyes are red and sore from spray But I can't wipe the pain away I'm locked up inside my box They forced me to accept the knocks My thoughts fall through, I'm aghast As I try to recall the past I'm a little dog with a hole in my head I really would be better off dead Electrode sticks out like a horn It's been there since I was born Must be a cause for my lack of brain Repeated shocks have rendered me insane Why do humans cause me harm I still remember life on the farm I was in a circus doing tricks Now I sitting here waiting for my fix They really made a monkey out of me Now I'm a bestial junkie Where's the man he's running late Sounds in my reverberate And I know it must be close To my final overdoseStereotypes of all their mates Got the same likes they've got the same hates Walking around all dressed the same They've been caught into the game Self expression doesn't count They don't know what it's about As long as they've alike they've safe No one criticizes their faith Fit into the system's slots Become a sucker for their plots Once thеy've caught you in their net Thеn they know that you're no threatSince I was young I've been told that I'm free But now that I'm older it don't seem like that to me Was pumped by school and media with your brainwashing lies Now I can see the truth your propaganda I despise The people around me praise democracy But all I can see is hypocrisy Your sick games of power are wearing thin Put one against the other and you know you'll win People commit murders and you openly condemn But if it was in wartime you'd make heros out of them Crazy double values and your teachings keep them strong But a murder is a murder and all killing is wrong The people around mе praise democracy But all I can see is hypocrisy Your sick games of powеr are wearing thin Put one against the other and you know you'll win Your sacred cow called money that you lock up and conceal Convince people they need it then you wonder why they steal Lock people up in prison because they must be taught a lesson If this system's the answer it must have been a stupid question The people around me praise democracy But all I can see is hypocrisy Your sick games of power are wearing thin Put one against the other and you know you'll winGovernment minister takes the stand starts to pontificate In his best patronizing tones the future for the state Although things seem difficult now they're just about to improve By using simple logic we can see that's not the truth How can the people listen and not see through all their lies They truly must be living in a fool's paradise How can the people listen and not see through all their lies They truly must be living in a fool's paradise Disparity and poverty are merely facts of life The rich need to get richer before the poor can end their strife It's said with such assurance with such confident aplomb We can't be the only ones that see where they are coming from How can the people listen and not see through all their lies They truly must be living in a fool's paradise How can the people listen and not see through all their lies They truly must be living in a fool's paradise Parliamentary democracy is nothing but a farce They'll help you up the ladder if you first crawl up their arse They say you've opportunity but never drop their guard They know you can't improve your hand because they hold all the cards How can the people listen and not see through all their lies They truly must be living in a fool's paradise How can the people listen and not see through all their lies They truly must be living in a fool's paradise How can the people listen and not see through all their lies They truly must be living in a fool's paradise How can the people listen and not see through all their lies They truly must be living in a fool's paradiseThe system gives you categories to keep you all defined You live to the image totally devoid of mind The groups play by the system's rules, the system they condemn Preach universal freedom when they mean freedom for them When you write to them you just receive a printed letter But don't you think a group that 'cares' should do a little better Pay them money, join their club to show you're a fan You'rе feeding the fire playing right into their hands Evеn when you see them live you're getting a bad deal Herded into massive halls no atmosphere no feel Anything with their name on you must rush out and buy The more you get the more you just perpetuate the lie Accept the shit they give you don't admit you're being conned Just give it two more years and then you'll see that you were wrong You think by elevating them you'll cast away your chains But when they're rich and famous you'll still be just the sameThe record player's broken so I'll have to give a trial To that black box in the corner and I fiddle with the dial It's as if I'm in a time warp, I can't believe my ears The crap that's coming over could reduce a dog to tears1975 1975 1975 it's just like 1975 again It doesn't matter where I tune my radio set The airwaves are full of songs I'd rather forget Either it's a cover or an oldie or just lame Plagiarized or sanitized it all sounds just the same1975 1975 1975 it's just like 1975 again The record player's broken so I'll have to give a trial To that black box in the corner and I fiddle with the dial It's as if I'm in a time warp, I can't believe my ears The crap that's coming over could reduce a dog to tears1975 1975 1975 it's just like 1975 again1975 1975 1975 it's just like 1975 againWhere have all the posers gone the snidey little sods The wrecked our revolution  then turned skin and mod All the early groups sold out when they could earn enough No one wants to know us now that things are getting rough Don't turn your back and pretend it never happened Forget what the papers said punk's not dead yet Money and commercial deals made bands just want to take We've seen what happened to them we won't make the same mistakes Don't want to play the big places, the Odeon or the Lyceum They kill off the excitement, but you still go and fill them Don't turn your back and pretend it never happened Forget what the papers said punk's not dead yet We won't change we won't give in Spike our hair we're gonna win We believe in what punk means We won't leave punk for deadCut down the rainforests, so cattle can graze, a short sighted act causing long term malaise Rare species and plant life extinct for all time as they carve the ridiculous from the sublime Feed the bulk of grain harvested to the meat herds while people are starving all over the world The waste from herds poisons water supplies, the meat industry causes people to die Stop interspecies discrimination, animal liberation is human liberation Put an end to all exploitation, animal liberation is human liberation How can you speak of compassion when the weakest are treated in this fashion Human liberation, animal rights, one struggle, one fight Give all sentient creatures consideration, animal liberation is human liberation Put an end to all exploitation, animal liberation is human liberation The basic roots of our oppression stem from hierarchical obsession Human liberation, animal rights, one struggle, one fight Destroy the exploitive corporations, animal liberation is human liberation Put an end to all exploitation, animal liberation is human liberation Create the illusion that science cures all, shout about breakthroughs that aren't there at all Deride all your critics as dangerous cranks, to keep public donations flowing into the bank No justification for all we are told, vivisection's has not yet cured so much as a cold Stop the money men, ignore all their patter, profits mean all to them, health and safety don't matter Animal Liberation is human liberation
