Golden brown, texture like sun Lays me down, with my mind she runs Throughout the night, no need to fight Never a frown with golden brown Every time, just like the last On her ship, tied to the mast To distant lands, takes both my hands Never a frown with golden brown Golden brown, finer temptress Through the ages, she's heading west From far away, stays for a day Never a frown with golden brown Never a frown  With golden brown  Never a frown  With golden brown  Never a frown  With golden brown  Never a frown  With golden brown Strolling along minding my own business Well, there goes a girl and a half She's got me going up and down She's got me going up and down Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches Well, I got the notion, girl That you got some suntan lotion in that bottle of yours Spread it all over my peelin' skin, baby That feels real good All this skirt, lappin' up the sun Lap me up Why don't you come on and lap me up Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches Well, there goes another one just lying down on the sand dunes I'd better go take a swim and see if I can cool down a little bit'Cause you and me woman We got a lotta things on our minds You know what I mean Whatever happened to Leon Trotsky He got an ice pick That made his ears burn Whatever happened to dear old Lenny The great Elmyr And Sancho Panza Whatever happened to the heroes Whatever happened to the heroes Whatever happened to all the heroes All the Shakespearoes They watched their Rome burn Whatever happened to the heroes Whatever happened to the heroes No more heroes any more No more heroes any moreHow many times have you woken up and prayed for the rain How many times have you seen the papers apportion the blame Who gets to say  Who gets to work and who gets to play I was always told at school, everybody should get the same How many times have you been told If you don't ask, you don't get How many lads have taken your money Your Mother said you shouldn't bet Who has the fun  Is it always a man with a gun Someone must have told you, if you work too hard, you can sweat There's always the sun, mm There's always the sun Always, always How many times have the weathermen told you stories That made you laugh You know its not unlike the politicians and the leaders When they do things by half Who gets the job of pushing the knob That's what responsibility you draw straws for If you're mad enough There's always the sun, mm There's always the sun Always, always Many people tell you that they're your friend You believe them, you need them for what's round the river bend Make sure that you're receiving the signals they send'Cos brother, you've only got two hands to lend Maybe there's someone who makes you weep And some nights loom up ahead when you're asleep Some days there's things on your mind you should keep Sometimes, it's tougher to look than to leap Better watch out for the skin deep Better watch out for the skin deep Watch out for the skin deep Watch out for the skin deep Better watch out for the skin deep One day the track that you're climbing gets steep Your emotions are frayed, and your nerves are starting to creep Just remember the days as long as the time that you keep Brother, you better watch out for the skin deep Better watch out for the skin deep Better watch out for the skin deep Watch out for the skin deep Watch out for the skin deep Better watch out for the skin deepBig girl in the red dress She's just trying to impress us And she's got the barley fever But she doesn't make a sound She's just hanging around She's just hanging around Down the Court road early With the Hustlers big and burly There's a million of 'em selling And the buyers can be found They're just hanging around They're just hanging around Christ he told his mother Christ he told her not to bother Cos he's alright in the city Cos he's high above the ground He's just hanging around He's just hanging around He's just hanging around He's just hanging around I’m collecting all these feelings for you Put them in a box in a darkened room And seal the lid with an industry-standard glue Make the box into a silent tomb With all these photographs and pictures of you Taken in a car and someone else’s front room This song will get me over you Lift me up and take me out of view This song that says that she’ll hurt you once or twice But she’ll never be with you the way you want her to This song will get me over you Take the box into uncharted sеas Far away from all humanity And swear the crew to absolutе secrecy Sink the box down to the ocean floor For maybe 20,000 leagues or more And ban deep-sea diving by an act of law This song will get me over you Lift me up and take me out of view This song that says that she’ll hurt you once or twice But she’ll never be with you the way you want her to This song will get me over youI need a dream where I can live what I said I need a place where I can make my bed I need a hole where I'll find darkness now And if you hassle me mister I might just lose my head Five minutes and you're almost there Five minutes and you're almost dead Five minutes and you're almost there Five minutes and you're almost dead They came home on Saturday night They killed a cat and they raped his wife And in their eyes there was fear and hate And when they spoke, they spoke with knives Five minutes and you're almost there Five minutes and you're almost dead Five minutes and you're almost there Five minutes and you're almost dead Some say that I should hate them all But I say that wouldn't help at all I just wanna find those guys, that's all I just wanna find those guys, that's all, that's all, that's all!Five minutes and you're almost there Five minutes and you're almost dead Five minutes and you're almost there Five minutes and you're almost deadLittle lady With Dingwall's bullshit You're so stupid Foetid brainwaves Little lady What really happens When you see mirrors You get the shivers Aaaah!Making love to

tree seeking water Or a daughter Nice 'n' sleazy Nice 'n' sleazy does it Nice 'n' sleazy, nice 'n' sleazy Does it, does it, does it every time Nice 'n' sleazy, nice 'n' sleazy Does it, does it, does
