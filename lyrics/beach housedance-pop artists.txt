It was late at night You held on tight From an empty seat A flash of light It will take a while To make you smile Somewhere in these eyes I'm on your side You wide-eyed girls You get it right Fall back into place Fall back into place Tender is the night For a broken heart Who will dry your eyes When it falls apart What makes this fragile world go 'round Were you ever lost Was she ever found Somewhere in these eyesDrifting in and out, you see the road you're on It came rollin' down your cheek, you say just what you mean And in-between, it's never as it seems Help me to name it Help me to name it If you built yourself a myth, you'd know just what to give What comes after this momentary bliss The consequence of what you do to me Help me to name it Help me to name it Found yourself in a new direction Arrows fallin' from the sun Canyon callin', would they come to greet you Let you know you're not the only one Can't keep hangin' on to what is dead and gone If you built yourself a myth, you'd know just what to give Materialize or let the ashes flyOut in the heartland I looked in your eyes And I asked, "Are you ready Ready for this life "Did you see it coming It happened so fast The timing was perfect Water on glass Like tracing figure eights On ice in skates, oh well And if this ice should break It would be my mistake Between the cities Between the thrills There's something inside you That doesn't sleep well It won't last forever Or maybe it will The white clothes they gave you You wear them so wellYou and me with our long hair on the gold wall After midnight we could feel it all I'd go anywhere you want me to You should see there's a place I want to take you When the train comes I will hold you Cause you blow my mind On the bridge levitating cause we want to When the unknown will surround you There is no right time There is no right time The branches of the trees They will hang lower now You will grow too quick Then you will get over it The branches of the trees They will hang lower now There's a place I want to take you When the unknown will surround you There's a place I want to take you When they knocked on the door looking for you…When the unknown will surround you As our bodies lift up slowly There's a place I want to take you When they knocked on the door looking for you…When the unknown will surround you As our bodies lift up slowly There's a place I want to take youGather matters of the heart, so we can act a fool It's incomplete without you The silver soul is running through It's a vision, complete illusion, yeah The needle on the spinning wheel collecting silver coil It gathers heat without you Whether or not you're turned from it It's a quick turn to let us in, yeah It is happening again It is happening again It is happening again It is happening again The bodies lying in the sand, they're moving in the dark It is so quick to let us in Feel it moving through our skin It's a sickness, infinite quickness, yeah It is happening again It is happening again It is happening again It is happening again It is happening again It is happening again It is happening again It is happening again It is happening again It is happening againYou always go to the parties To pluck the feathers off all the birds On your knees I would not beg you, please I want your picture but not your words You know they’d want it, but there's no first On your own But you cannot call it your home We always rub our hands too much We know the reasons, but such and such On your own You will not catch your own bone We run our fingers together You know it's easy, The devil's plan On your own You cannot call me your own Jack of all trades Master of none Cry all the time Cause I'm not having funStand beside it, we can't hide the way you make us glow It's no good unless it grows Feel this burning, love of mine Deep inside the ever spinning Tell me, does it feel It's no good unless it's real Hillsides burning, wild-eyed turning 'til we're running from it I'd take care of you if you'd ask me to In a year or two You say swimming in the lake, we'll come across a snake It is real and then it's fake Feel its heartbeat, feel what you heat Far so fast, it feels too late I'd take care of you if you'd ask me to In a year or two I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's trueNo better colour Looked everywhere Driving home every night The shadows stay by your side You built a city All in your head Triangle of ever light It turns you on every night Need a companion A hidden prayer You know you're not losing your mind What’s left you make something of it The sky and what's left above it The way you want nothing of it Baby I'm yours No better color Look everywhere You built a city All in your head You know you're not losing your mind What’s left you make something of it The sky and what's left above it The way you want nothing of it WildflowerBeyond love The first thing that I do before I get into your house I'm gonna tear off all the petals From the rose that's in your mouth Beyond love You wanted to find Elvis and I didn't understand They take the simple things inside you And put nightmares in your hands Beyond love This man comes to me Heartbreak did this He was made to believe That he should live without it All I know's what I see No change in this Visions born in the dreams Of a world left without it We really wanna know We really do agree We really do agree We really wanna know The last thing that she sees before they turn off all the lights Was there, a man up in the corner with the spiders made of lightWe drive around this town Houses melting down A vision turning green Is all we've ever seen And then it's dark again A new development Wishing that it meant Something natural Don't we know it's cruel And it goes dark again Just like a spark Hallucination comes Think of everyone That never shared before From my mouth to yours And then it's dark again Just like a spark And then it vanishes No one around And then it comes again Just like a spark And then we're vanishing No one around And then it comes again Just like a spark
