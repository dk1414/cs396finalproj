~Heather's gone She left a note"He Is Legend Was all she wrote"Go fetch the detective I think I've found something This isn't Heather's handwriting That's right, I said it I said it I said it I said it I said it I said it I said it I said it I said it"D ON'T Y OU T AL K T O S TR AN GE RS YO U K NO W I T L EA DS T O D AN GE R""I could be a big Star some day!!!!!!"Now everywhere I see is brown Dirt and dust, dry rocks and mountains Stockholm Syndrome, blistered mouth Planet’s bare and nothing’s sprouting Since you let go of my hand I’m crying tears of sand I’m surprised to see you wake And more surprised to hear you saying“I’ll be your Boogiewoman if you'll be my Boogieman At night, go hand in hand Kick up dust across the badlands I’ll be your Boogiewoman if you'll be my Boogieman Now that you’ve grown on me I won’t let you down again”Everything I see is black Houses, churches, charred from fire Capgras syndrome, who are y'all Slept all night, despair can call Final tear drop filled your eye Down your cheek, hung from your chin Broke your curse when it hit the ground That’s when you spoke againIt's getting late, I'm coming home I picked this rose for you I've been away searching for oceans With time to kill You better buy a gun I've seen them watching you The old man and his son They've  been studying your moves Why won't it rain they need the water They'll die faster than you I'm not in pain I've got my flowers It's happening You better get your gun I see them watching you This pain has just begun You will see me in the news I know you will And I don't understand why I sleep all day And I start to complain when there is no rain I don't believe in miracles I don't believe in miracles But I believe in youWhere did she go I do not know And which direction was it snowing I'll turn around again Paint over pictures on the wall I can't believe she gave me alcohol I thought of Jezebel Hung from a wrecking ball to see your fashion show I think you know me well, I think you know me well You know me well, you know me well Juliet!You know you want it I've been receiving strange phone calls from the city And I will not extend my hand to the general And I do not think the people will remember us Alright!Hung from a wrecking ball to see your fashion show I think you know me well, I think you know me wellWhen you leave, and you will When the going gets tough And you turn tail and run We’re aware that you’re scared But uncertainty’s always nine-tenths of the fun Stay with me, I’m begging you Don’t do this on your own Stay with me, I’m not a fool Not just for anyone Every time you return With fresh meat in your teeth And a spark in your eye Does it burn, burn for me I have never been strong enough to be released Stay with me, I’m begging you Don’t do this on your own Stay with me, I’m not a fool Not just for anyone Stay with me I’m warning you Stay with me, I’m not a fool Not just for anyoneEach day you step through me Never bat an eye No surprise Now slowly but surely You will recognize I'm the shivers down your spine Traded in my halo Heaven's holy payload I'll never get my wings I choose darker things You never called to me And I'm not on your mind No surprise The breath on the window The handprint on your neck You're still mine Traded in my halo Heaven's holy payload I will never get my wings I'm doing wicked things I chose the darkness above the light Cause you know that it's the same damn thingI'm the reason this got started Devil’s work dearly departed You'll never catch me in the light I'm why you lock your doors at night Call me evil, call me Satan I’m in the shadows salivating Just close your eyes and count to ten Play nice, you'll never see me again One last time Would you open the door Step into the light And show us your face One last time Would you open the door Step into the light You'll be silent forever Always clutching your heart You'll be silent forever I'll be gone, gone in the dark Everyone knows the situation You never go to a second location Somebody should have warned you Now through clenched teeth and sullied pride I'll ask you nicely, get inside Don't make a sound, don't see my face Hell is only a mile awayKick down the door Release the smoke Not crying wolf This ain't no joke I need your faith in foolish things Call down a flood Put out my flame I blame you for my shame Fire could never clear your name And though the flames consume me All the fires in hell couldn't hold me down This world means nothing to me The night grew cold to no relief No warmth in death No good in greed If I should die before I wake Better in dreams than at the stake I blame you for my shame Fire could never clear your nameWe diagnose the seasons now How can you deny it Is it over yet The fever in the sky from burning red A lesson learned And I don't know why She is out of breath At the door of death It's clandestine But she hides But she hides it well I thought when summer came along I'd come out of hiding When I stepped out to warm my bones I smelled my flesh was frying It's not over yet The sickness in the sky's silhouette You'll never learnI can't go anywhere They can smell it on me I can't do anything I'm a cavity I know you'll grin and bare I know you'll show your teeth I tend to get a bit obsessive I've gotta take 'em home with me I'm sick I wasn't faking I really had to take 'em It's such a sight to see Your pearly whites Like precious stars How did I get so lucky Just sick enough No accountability, I always go untouched Just sick enough Not to answer for this crime I'll take what's mine
