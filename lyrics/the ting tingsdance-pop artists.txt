Four-letter word just to get me along It's a difficulty and I'm bitin' on my tongue And I, I keep stallin', not keepin' it together People around gotta find somethin' to say now Holdin' back, every day the same Don't wanna be a loner, listen to me, oh, no I never say anything at all But with nothing to consider, they forget my name-ame-ame-ame They call me hell They call me Stacey They call me her They call me Jane That's not my name That's not my name That's not my name That's not my name They call me quiet But I'm a riot Mary-Jo-Lisa Always the same That's not my name That's not my name That's not my name That's not my nameHey!Shut up and let me go This hurts, I tell you so For the last time you will kiss my lips Now shut up and let me go Your jeans were once so clean I bet you've changed your wardrobe since we met Now, oh, so easily you're over me Gone is love It's you that ought to be holding me I'm not containable This time love is not sustainable I ain't freakin', I ain't fakin' this I ain't freakin', I ain't fakin' this I ain't freakin', I ain't fakin' this Shut up and let me go Hey!Shut up and let me go This hurts, what I can't show For the last time you have me in bits Now shut up and let me go For fear of living in regret I've changed since from when we first metTwo hands I wanna play the piano with two hands Shoulda learned To ask for many it's the way of the world Boy you wanna be good to me You gave me a piano with all 88 keys But two hands What's a girl to do with two hands To make the money like the richest of man What's a guy to do with two hands I can make you be so good to me You give me all the time with my sexuality So clap your hands if you're working too hard Clap your hands if you're working too hard Clap your hands if you're working too hard Clap your hands if you're working too hard And the beat's so hard, you're workin', workin'I can't undo, I can't unsee I can't unchoose, I can't unchange I can't unpack, I can't unlose I can't unfake you've caused no pain What are we going to do, me and you I guess it's just different points of view But I can't gain perspective When you appear so unaffected Estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange This estranged feel strange, estranged feels strange When there never was a fight, a wrong doing to blame It's not the same as an argument Estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange Now I can't relate, I can't feel safe I can't retain, I can't stay the same I can't even say your name, I count the days I cannot stand this bitter taste So, what's the problem between us two 'Cause I can't find perspective When I still feel so connected to youFed up with your indigestion Swallow worries one by one Folks got high at a quarter to five Don't you feel your growing up undone Nothing but the local D JHe said he had some songs to play What went down from this fooling around Gave hope and a brand new day Imagine all the girls Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah And the boys Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah And the strings Ee-ee-ee-ee, ee-ee-ee-ee And the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums The drums, the drums, the drums, the drums The drums, the drums, the drums, the drums,

in a glove This preacher plays it all night longMy friends, they get me higher and higher They're killing me with friendly fire We meet beneath the cactus tree But walking on spikes just ain't for me My friends ain't got to worry more They meet outside the corner store And walk the pavement, miss the cracks I'd join them if I could relax Look for tricks when you don't have a thing Live like a hermit if you wanna be king People say it's not worth the wait Everybody loves somebody to hate I'm not gonna go and rush this through my veins Blow them up while looking for this again Punk rock ain't in division Send all the wicked kings to prison I wanna write about setting something free All the changes drive us back to sea And this is all about starting out again Same old, same old, never the same, the sameThere was this boy who came to town Was cooler than the boys in all my crazy dreams All the problems I thought I had all but disappeared And he would always, always think of me first And we were writing the history books and we were so in love And there was this girl, she used to hang out I never saw anything, anyone, no one so beautiful And she would sit around and wait for the day to end And she would offer herself as if she had nowhere else to go And I didn't think nothing of it And that's when my life went cold And then she was now sleeping in your bed And she was all over you And there she was sleeping in my bed And then there were all these issues And then there were all these issues This time I'm gonna get it right I'm gonna paint my face like the Guggenheim
