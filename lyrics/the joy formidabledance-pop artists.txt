This much delight Fills columns to new heights All these things about me you never can tell Colours run prime Paint a picture so bright All these things about me you never can tell You make me sleep so badly invisible friend Turn the dial on my words I can feel them fall short Turn the dial, chime alarm, chime alarm Watch these hands move apart Turn the dial on my words I can see you staying here Fierce steps shadow, Life's will gone shallow All these things about me you never can tell You make me sleep so badly invisible friend You make me sleep so badly invisible friend You make me sleep so badly invisible friendSellotape an end to Sellotape an end to Sellotape an end to Sellotape an end Sitting pretty, up-tightly The knots keep you at my side Upstairs in corners Eyes blink for the call Up and out, my beacon Will choke if yours is taken I'd have four more lines Four more lines Sellotape an end to Sellotape an end to Sellotape an end to Sellotape an end Harder thoughts, mosquito Right down my fickle hands Machine surprises Meant for me Up and out, my beacon Will choke if yours is taken I'd have four more lines Four more linesCall in the social Call in the mediation How else can a shadow Behind her not follow Call on the lonely A plea for you to befriend her Make only you feel better Make only you Nothing outside will care enough Nothing outside will care enough Nothing outside will care enough Nothing outside of you This trail that you're treading Is one flicked switch awaiting many The coils, the echoes rattling I hope the fears are buried beneath my love My love, love is the everchanging spectrum of a lie A lie, a lie to hide behind when nothing's right You take form with ink and blood Can't you see I'm good Nothing outside will care enough Nothing outside will care enough Nothing outside of youA glass, a view, a mirror, which one Distracts like open windows in the gusts A calm day will come A calm day will This dream is, this dream is This dream is in a telescope now This dream is, this dream is This dream is, this dream is This dream is in a telescope now This dream is, this dream is Fever in bedtime covers go unknown This fright, it grows and misses, sinks and floats A calm day will come My calm days will This dream is, this dream is This dream is in a telescope now This dream is, this dream is This dream is, this dream is This dream is in a telescope now This dream is, this dream is Ah, ah A calm day will come Ah, ahBe sy'n digwydd dywed Be ddoth o'r cudd-le Pwy sy'n codi o'r geg Sy'n brathu nôl yn anheg Yn hollti y dymuniad Pwy sy'n

done or is it drag Waking up stressed, great Stepping out into a person Is you about today Well, the universe it tipped a bit And left me with half a share The children love the box again The animals, right there And the voices from the past, they say the future will be kinder They live in all our memories, some of us need reminding Glad I didn't stay back in a bitter embrace There's a fire that needs putting out With the sun on our faces Oh, there go the followers Right under our feet Come back, we'll be lovers You're on the wrong side On the wrong side On the wrong side On the wrong side Let's drive a bit on these dusty roads And watch the day race Can be untouched out here Happier than we've ever been it hurts me too I'm bending in a different way And all of it's for you There's a presence coming up ahead Let's stop and play a game You guess which way is back And I'll guess when we're leaving There's always a way out The thing that we make is love If you can't see that you have it all Won't hurt to give it upYou see me for what I am I don't have to guess anymore That slow doubt that won't speak up Gets just enough then withdraws'Cause things go bad but it's real and there Better than slowly emptying me Into the blue Into the blue once again Just one big wave Just one big wave Just one big wave When I watch you from across the way Everything's still until I hold you again Just that moment of being attached, let it split you in two'Cause I'll be here, inside, outside Grateful that we at least felt something We went into the blue Into the blue once again'Cause now I see this place was here all along Don't fear the move out of the past Let time take your hand and guide you It's time to move Into the blue once againYawn, yawn to the detached now See them screaming underneath Fill your baskets up with dead fruit Watch the poison trickle free Always something in the way now Always something in the way now Borders feel the same now All the borders feel the same now If you leave, leave what you are Your hand's a wall, I need the same It turns on light, my gift's a threat Watch from afar and pour your hands in deep And you'll find a claw it says Always something in the way now A barking dogma, some happy minute Spilt on the window is what you are I never mentioned all the things I did It's the pain that keeps you wanting So take over, so take, you're the ugly truth If you leave, leave what you are If you leave, leave what you are If you leave, leave what you are If you leave, leave what you are If you leave, leave what you arePull out the same and I'm sitting out of this one The bloated pet, wringing out his own tongue Stealing tracks that we would have followed out of here You're stealing fractions from a whole that disappears And the talk, everybody wants a coup But you start it, someone else and I'll recoup Sell the stream, the source is turning into mud And tell the valleys, nothings turning far enough Between the wreck there's heaven sent Between the choice I'd rather have And at the end a chapter goes And now the finish is the start Between the wreck there's heaven sent Between the choice I'd rather have And at the end a chapter goes And now the finish is the start The fire spits everybody's talking low We won't go away, not until your body's cold If one by one the pillars fall away The floor floats like a ray Between the wreck there's heaven sent Between the choice I'd rather have And at the end a chapter goes And now the finish is the startUnderneath the petal I lay down Call myself a shadow fall over a cloud All of these things that pull you away All of these things that make you change I'll play you a song as sweet as can be Those notes in the dark are for you and me Another day has still hours that make me yours Before the sky gets flooded, darkness falls Why does this bad blood flow at the end Surprises like oil and then sits on a bend Makes me think you're standing in my light It's hard feeling beaten when your heart's become silent Underneath the petal it's all mine That search for something more Well it's already in the storm We'll be all right now We'll be all right now We've got our own way Oh we've got our own way And it plays around, plays around, plays around Like thunder on a clear day Underneath the promise I fell down You looked so much happier than you do right now Those drowning eyes won't carry me That stranger's way will make me leave Underneath the petal it's all fine Underneath the petal it's all mine Come in and look around I'm going back Crossing off what's in front of me I'll stay here as the world come the shakes
