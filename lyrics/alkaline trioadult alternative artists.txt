It's been a long day living with this It's been a long time since I felt so sick I took a long walk straight back home I could've walked back to San Francisco I used to long for time alone I used to long for a place of my own Now I'm losing faith in everything I'm lost, so lost, I'm lost at sea, you see I used to long for broken bones I used to long for a casket to call my own I never had a problem facing fear But I'm done, over and out, my dear, and Oh, mercy me God bless catastrophe Cause there's no way in hell We'll ever live to see through this So drive yourself insane tonight, it's not that far away And I just filled up your tank earlier today, yeah It's been a long day living with this It's been a long time since I felt so sick I took a long walk straight back home I could've walked back to Chicago I used to long for time alone I used to long for a place of my own And I've lost faith in everything I'm lost, so lost, I'm lost without youI dragged this lake looking for corpses Dusted for prints, pried up the floorboards Pieces of planes and black box recorders Don't lie And I've been preoccupied with these sick, sixth senses That sense D NA on barbed wire fences Maybe someday I'll find me a suspect That has no alibi New Year's Eve was as boring as heaven I watched flies fuck on channel 11 There was no one to kiss, there was nothing to drink Except some old rotten milk someone left in the sink And there's no ring on the phone anymore There's no reason to call, I passed out on the floor Smoked myself stupid and drank my insides raisin dry But at the right place at the right time I'll be dead wrong and you'll be just fine And I won't have to quit doing fucked up shit For anyone but me And at the right place at the right time It will have been worth it to stand in line And you won't have to stop Saying "I love cops" for anyone but me Your private eyeIs this thing cursed This goddamn thing's the worst Now one look in that direction And everything starts to hurt Is this thing cursed It's been around for years And everytime my boat's about tits up That goddamn thing is near I tried to throw it in the river But it washed up in my sink And now the city cut my water And it's all I have to drink Is this thing cursed If it is then I'm the jerk Who keeps on hanging around When I simply should just burn it to the ground Maybe it's some kind of spell That I've been living under Collecting coins found near a nightmare wishing well Coldest regards signed my name and sealed the card Tried to leave it all behind me and almost blew up in my car Is this thing cursed Is this thing cursed You're on your own my little nightmare, you cannot stay here It's far too bright for you If they attack you, just lay there Play dead dear, it's your only hope of pulling through And seconds, they seem like a lifetime, a dream Recurring, a dream that can't come true And they'll pin it all on you After all you've been put through Sadie G, she's crazy, see That's what the white coats say, and now, miss Susan A, you're losing every Opportunity To put us all away Now run along my little nightmare, your job is done here You've scared them all to death If they revive them, just sit there Just smile dear, make them thankful for every breath This sentence may seem like a lifetime, a scream That's curdling the blood they found on you And your knives and clothing too Charlie's broken .22I've got a book of matches I've got a can of kerosene I've got some bad ideas Involving you and me I don't blame you for walking away I touched myself at thoughts of flames I shat the bed, I laid there in it Thinking of you, wide awake for days And I found you tongue-tied In my twisted little brain You couldn't crack a smile I didn't catch your name I don't blame you for walking away I'd do the same if I saw me I swear it's not contagious In four short steps we can erase this Step one, slit my throat Step two, play in my blood Step three, cover me in dirty sheets And run laughing out of the house Step four, stop off at Edgebrook Creek And rinse your crimson hands You took me hostage and made your demands I couldn't meet them so you cut off my fingers, one by oneNever said what I was thinking The night you turned up at my door I could tell that you’d been drinking As we went crashing to the floor You came from Santa Monica With teardrops in your eyes We passed out in the shadows Of a lonely Thursday night We kissed away our memories And fucked away the pain We went out for some coffee And then we did it all again My Krystalline Ooh ooh I want you Krystalline Ooh ooh I want you Krystalline Couldn’t tell what you were thinking The night I turned up at the bar I told you I quit drinking And you laughed til you saw stars I came to Santa Monica With flowers in my hand I grabbed you by the lips with mine And slowly pulled you inIt's about time that I came clean with you No longer fine, I'm no longer running smooth I thought that I found myself under something new Just one more line I repeat over and over again'Till I'm blue in the face with a choking regret As I talk in circles 'round you on my bed Can't say I blame you one bit when you kept it all inside When you left that night It's about time that you got sick of me No longer fun, and so far from interesting I thought that I found me a cure for feeling old Just one more line to keep me sleeping loudly and cold In disgrace with a shameful regret As I talk in tongues to myself in my bed Can't say I blame you one bit when you kept it all inside When you left that night And all that followed fell like mercury to hell Somehow we lost our heads for the last time And all that followed fell like mercury to hell Somehow we lost our heads for the last time And I don't dream since I quit sleeping And I haven't slept since I met you And you can't breathe without coughing at daytime Neither can I So what do you say Your coffin, or mine Burning on an autumn night A piece of me has been set alight Moving like a locomotive To tear you up and take your life away Coming down like Christmas lights Strung up on these walls for countless nights Douse my house in gasoline Strike a match and walk Away, yeah Feeding on the fainting models Hey, yeah White meat festival, yeah Hey, yeah Ocean filled with plastic bottles Hey, yeah Entitled waves will wash us all away Wash us all away I’m turning in this burning wreck Shattered windshield, broken back Crawling on your arms to safety Before the flames take your life away Stab me with stiletto heels Feed me pills and happy meals Leave me here to bleed out slowly Smile, spit, and swiftly walkShaking like a dog shitting razorblades Waking up next to nothing after dreaming of you and me I'm waking up all alone, waking up so relieved While you're taking your time with apologies I'm making my plans for revenge Red eyes on orange horizons If Columbus was wrong I'd drive straight off the edge I'd drive straight off the edge Taking your own life with boredom I'm taking my own life with wine It helps you to rule out the sorrow It helps me to empty my mind Making the most of a bad time I'm smoking the brains from my head Leaving the coal calling the kettle black and orange and red This kettle is seeing red.I've got a big fat fucking bone to pick with you my darling In case you haven't heard I'm sick and tired of trying I wish you would take my radio to bathe with you Plugged in and ready to fallShe's black and red and built just like a spy plane Extracting information from my mind The photographs she take save to a mainframe For your eyes only lonely cold war time Now after all the city falls just like the night or an angel does Leave me here alone to collect my things She sees music in the terror she brings And like a technicolor dream The light in your eyes blinded me From your perch you softly smiled My Blackbird softly smiled She's built for speed and made for keeping secrets Stark and dark against enemy skies From miles above the earth no one can detect her My blackbird blows a kiss that ends mankind And all this time there is no crime of treason that she hasn't seen
