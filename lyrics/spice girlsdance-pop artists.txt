that way foreverDo you still remember How we used to be Feeling together Believing whatever My love has said to me Both of us were dreamers Young love in the sun Felt like my saviour My spirit I gave ya We'd only just begun Hasta mañana Always be mine Viva forever I'll be waiting Everlasting like the sun Live forever For the moment Ever searching for the one Yes, I still remember Every whispered word The touch of your skin Giving life from within Like a love song never heard Slipping through our fingers Like the sands of time Promises made Every memory saved As reflections in my mindLove is blind, as far as the eye can see Deep but meaningless words to me Easy lover, I need a friend Road to nowhere, twist and turns but will this never end Well my dear you'll know that he pleases me But short term solution ain't no resolution That ain't no release for me Too much of something is bad enough But something's coming over me to make me wonder Too much of nothing is just as tough I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied Unwrap yourself from around my finger Hold me too tight or left to linger Something fine built to last Slipped up there, I guess we're running out of time too fast Yes my dear you know he soothes me There's no complication, there's no explanation It's just a groove in meShe used to be my only enemy and never let me be free Catching me in places that I knew I shouldn't be Every other day I crossed the line, I didn't mean to be so bad I never thought you would become the friend I never had]Back then I didn't know why Why you were misunderstood So now I see through your eyes All that you did was love Mama I love you, Mama I care Mama I love you, Mama my friend You're my friend I didn't want to hear it then, but I'm not ashamed to say it now Every little thing you said and did was right for me I've had a lot of time to think about, about the way I used to be Never had a sense of my responsibility Back then I didn't know why Why you were misunderstood So now I see through your eyes All that you did was loveHa-ha-ha-ha-ha Yo, I'll tell you what I want What I really, really want So tell me what you want What you really, really want I'll
