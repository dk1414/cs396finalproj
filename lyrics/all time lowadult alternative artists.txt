Why do all the monsters come out at night Why do we sleep where we want to hide Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life Another day, 'nother headache in this hangover hotel Gettin' used to the rhythm, yeah, I know this beat too well Tunnel visions got me feeling like you're the only one I see But I know what's missing when I'm swimmin'In my lonely luxury I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night Why do we sleep where we want to hide Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life Why am I a sucker for all your lies Strung out like laundry on every line Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life I'm addicted to the way you hurt, the way you contradict me I swear everything look worse at night, I think I'm overthinking I don't care who I might hurt along the way, I'm fuckin' sinking Into every word, I don't care if you're lyin' when I'm drinking, so Tell me pretty lies, look me in my face Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake And you can lead me on and leave these questions in my sheets I'm under it, I made my bed and I'm still wonderin'I got your picture, I'm coming with you, Dear Maria, count me in There's a story at the bottom of this bottle and I'm the pen When the lights go off I want to watch the way you take the stage by storm The way you wrap those boys around your finger Go on and play the leader' cause you know it's what you're good at The low road for the fast track, make every second last'Cause I got your picture, I'm coming with you, Dear Maria, count me in There's a story at the bottom of this bottle and I'm the pen Make it count when I'm the one who's selling you out'Cause it feels like stealing hearts, calling your name from the crowd Live and let live, you'll be the showgirl of the home team I'll be the narrator telling another tale of the American dream I see your name in lights, we can make you a star Girl, we'll take the world by storm, it isn't that hard'Cause I got your picture, I'm coming with you, Dear Maria, count me in There's a story at the bottom of this bottle and I'm the pen Make it count when I'm the one who's selling you out'Cause it feels like stealing hearts, calling your name from the crowdHe woke up from dreaming and put on his shoes Started making his way past 2 in the morning He hasn't been sober for days Leaning now into the breeze Remembering Sunday, he falls to his knees They had breakfast together But two eggs don't last Like the feeling of what he needs Now this place seems familiar to him She pulled on his hand with a devilish grin She led him upstairs, she led him upstairs Left him dying to get in Forgive me, I'm trying to find My calling, I'm calling at night I don't mean to be a bother But have you seen this girl She's been running through my dreams And it's driving me crazy, it seems I'm gonna ask her to marry me And even though she doesn't believe in love He's determined to call her bluff Who could deny these butterflies They're filling his gut Waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces He pleads, though he tries But he's only denied Now he's dying to get insideI heard that you've been self-medicating In the quiet of your room Your sweet suburban tomb And if you need a friend I'll help you stitch up your wounds I've heard that you've been having some trouble Finding your place in the world I know how much that hurts But if you need a friend Then please, just say the word You've come this far You're all cleaned up You've made a mess again There's no more trying It's time to sort yourself out Hold on tight This ride is a wild one Make no mistake, the day will come When you can't cover up what you've done Now don't lose your fight, kid It only takes a little push to pull on through With so much left to do You'll be missing out And we'll be missing you Come on My ship went down In a sea of sound When I woke up alone I had everything A handful of moments I wish I could change And a tongue like a nightmare that cut like a blade In a city of fools I was careful and cool But they tore me apart like a hurricane A handful of moments I wish I could change but I was carried away Give me therapy I'm a walking travesty But I'm smiling at everything Therapy, you were never a friend to me And you can keep all your misery My lungs gave out As I faced the crowd I think that keeping this up could be dangerous I'm flesh and bone I'm a rolling stone And the experts say I'm deliriousOn a fault line, late night Underneath the stars we came alive And singing to the sky just felt right I won't forget the good times While the punks started picking fights With the skater kids under city lights Remember how we laughed 'til we cried I won't forget the good times I never want to leave this sunset town But one day the time may come And I'll take you at your word And carry on I'll hate the goodbye But I won't forget the good times I won't forget the good times We were bare-knuckled, tight lip Middle fingers up, ego trip Devil may care but we didn't mind I won't forget the good times We're the boys in black smoking cigarettes Chasing girls who didn't know love yet As the bonfire moon came down I won't forget the good timesI don't believe in saints They never make mistakes I know it's not my place Who am I to tell you that you need to change Her closet's such a mess Filled up with all the skeletons she's kept Nobody's perfect I confess But she's perfect enough without ever dressing up, yeah Dirty laundry is piling in her room She's got her secrets, yeah I've got mine too I don't care about what you did Only care about what we do Dirty laundry Looks good on you Now here's some honesty Sometimes I trip over your history Wish I could change my mind But it's the things I shouldn't see that always catch my eye Dirty laundry is piling in her room She's got her secrets, yeah I've got mine too I don't care about what you did Only care about what we do Dirty laundry Looks good on you I'm a liar, I'm a cynic I'm a sinner, I'm a saint I'm a loser, I'm a critic I'm the ghost of my mistakes And it's all my fault that I'm still the one you want What are you after Some kind of disaster, yeah I woke up from a never-ending dream I shut my eyes at 17 I lost every moment in between I felt the sun rise up and swallow me, yeah And it's all my fault that I'm still the one you want I'm a liar, I'm a cynic I'm a sinner, I'm a saint I'm a loser, I'm a critic I'm the ghost of my mistakes And it's all my fault that I'm still the one you want So what are you after Some kind of disaster Why do all the monsters come out at night Why do we sleep where we want to hide Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life Another day, 'nother
