I remember when we first started You came to me and you were brokenhearted I took you in and wiped all your tears away I gave you loving more than any other gave Don't you know I'm the one And I love you, girl I don't care what they say You know you are my world Come back home To the one who loves you more and more Soon you'll see That it was me you were searching for Spring love Come back to me Spring love Come back to me Spring love Come back to me I can remember the first time we ever met The sun was shining Love was gleaming in the air You caught my eye and the next thing that I knew I was in love, I was so in love with you We were so close for a season of my life I wanted so much to have you for my wife But something changed, season came to an end I had to leave you, and that's where my heartache beganThere was a time in my life When I opened my eyes and there you were You were more than a dream I could reach out and touch you, girl That was long ago There are some things That I guess I'll never know When you love someone You gotta learn to let them go When I dream about you That's when everything's all right You're in my arms Here next to me, forever When I dream about you Girl, you never go away Just close my eyes Wait for my dreams'Cause I still love, loving you How can I get you to see That I'm falling apart since you've been gone I can never be sure I could ever let go Your love is much too strongHow can I explain The sorrow and my pain I believe that you and I should be Together once again Every night I pray That you'll come back to me But the tears keep falling down my face When you're not around But now you're gone Gone away All I do is wait for you Each and every day But now you're gone Gone away All I do is wait for you Each and every day Oh, I'm waiting for your love I'm wondering where you are Are you with another guy Are you showing him your world Oh, I'm waiting for your love I want to see your smile Brighten up my day Yes, I'm waiting for your love Yes, I'm waiting for your loveYou gotta believe there is something inside of me You might say, "How could you so fast"Is the way you make me feel like you understand There is a way I can meet your demand, girl 'cause If you see the sun in my eyes It should be as no surprise It's the light of love inside of me Now tell me what do you see In my eyes In my eyes In my eyes In my eyes In my eyes In my eyes In my eyes In my eyes I know it's hard to see how I feel this way I just don't have control of my heart And if you feel what I feel and you wanna stay Just give me a sign, girl, and we'll never partI don't know, what happened to the love we shared Don't go, sometimes I think it's just not fair I know, the pain I feel inside my heart I wish I'd known it from the start That you would come and break my heart I can't hold back these tears in my eyes The feeling of pain inside me cause...Chorus:I'm dreaming of love, thinking of you Remembering times that we once shared Dreaming of love, thinking of you And knowing someday you'll come back to my life I try to love, but it just don't feel the same Our love was once in a lifetime I'll take the blame God above, hear my prayer Bring her back to me I wish I'd known you from the start That you would come and break my heart I can't hold back these tears in my eyes The feeling of pain inside me cause...I'm dreaming of love I am dreaming of loveIt's not too late Don't make me wait If you love me I won't give up without a fight Girl, this love is on my mind I've known that true love is hard to find Girl, you're always on my mind It's up to you to make it last Girl, forgive me for the past Since you came into my life My whole world has changed I want you to stay I treated you so kind and gave you all my love Girl, please won't you stay If you still love me, you won't let me go If you still love me, you won't let me If you still love me, you won't let me go If you still love me, you won't let me go Won't let me go Won't let me go Won't let me go Won't let me goEvery single day, I think of you And the lovely things you make me feel And there's no other one who is like you This is why I say this one's for you You're the one I think about You're one of a kind You're the one I think about I know you well You're the one I think about You're on my mind You're the one I think about Can't you tell When
