When you're close to tears remember Someday it'll all be over One day we're gonna get so high Though it's darker than December What's ahead is a different colour One day we're gonna get so high And at the end of the day remember the days When we were close to the end And wonder how we made it through the night At the end of the day Remember the way We stayed so close to the end We'll remember it was me and you Cause we are gonna be Forever, you and me You will Always keep me flying high in the sky Of love Don't you think it's time you started Doing what we always wanted One day we're gonna get so high Cause even the impossible Is easy when we got each other One day we're gonna get so highI wish I knew how it would feel to be free I wish I could break all the chains holding me I wish I could say all the things that I should say Say 'em loud say 'em clear For the whole wide world to hear I wish I could share All the love that's in my heart Remove all the bars that keep us apart And I wish you could know how it is to be me Then you'd see and agree that every man should be free I wish I could be like a bird in the sky How sweet it would be if I found I could fly Well I'd soar to the sun and look down at the sea And I'd sing cos I know how it feels to be free I wish I knew how it would feel to be free I wish I could break all the chains holding me And I wish I could say all the things that I wanna say Say 'em loud say 'em clear For the whole wide world to hear Say 'em loud say 'em clear For the whole wide world to hear Say 'em loud say 'em clear For the whole wide world to hearSay it's true Black and blue I can share your situation Keeping hold on our emotions They will only make us cry And you go But I don't know What you know It ain't so serious anyway When the clouds arrive we'll live on Ocean Drive Don't know why You're so blue The sun's gonna shine on everything you do And the sky Is so blue The sun's gonna shine on everything you do He left you Black and blue Without a word of explanation And he took your love for granted and He left you and high dry But you know Someday Well you'll wonder what You see in him anywaySometimes I get tired of this me-first attitude You are the one thing that keeps me smiling That's why I'm always wishing hard for you Cause your light shines so bright I don't feel no solitude You are my first star at night I'd be lost in space without you And I'll never lose my faith in you How will I ever get to heaven, if I do Feels just so fine When we touch the sky me and you This is my idyll of heaven Why can't it always be so good But it's all right, I know you're out there Doing what you've gotta do You are my soul satellite I'd be lost in space without you And I'll never lose my faith in you How will I ever get to heaven, if I do And I'll never lose my faith in you How will I ever get to heaven, if I doI've been through days of silence When I thought I saw your face It happens all the time now It's how I fill my empty days The dark days are coming And I know there's no escape I didn't think I cared that much Now I'm losing everything I don't know where I am I don't know what to do And I don't know who I am I don't know where to go And I don't know what it is I don't know how to live And I just wanna see you Hang on It's not the end We're gonna live again I'll be with you again We're gonna live again The last days of summer And our thirty thousand days We've put it all behind us now There's just an empty space The miracles of science And the God that gave my faith They ain't been much use to me With the things I can't replaceYou told me not to make you wait Then you don't call for days You told me not to be too late Then you don't come to me How many times you're gonna let me down You're keeping me hanging on at sea And wrapped around your finger Never believed that I'd ever find myself Looking up to the upper hand and Loving every minute, baby I won't mind Ain't gonna give up as long as I Don't mi-o-mind Don't wanna quit after all this time I won't mind Ain't gonna give up as long as I Don't mi-o-mind Don't wanna quit after all this time Totally lost the way you came Rainbow coloured day Hopin' not the way you changed Then it all starts to fadeI'd really love to be alone without All the ache and pain and the April showers But it ain't long before I long for you Like a ray of hope coming through the blue moon When it all gets dark again The whole thing falls apart I guess It doesn't even matter 'bout the rain Cause we'll get through it anyway We'll get up and start again Cause we could be lifted, lifted, lifted We could be lifted from the shadows, lifted Oh, we could be lifted up today Lifted all the way, you and I forever baby Lifted, lifted, lifted, hey yeah yeah It's undisturbable, the peace we found In a bright new space up above the clouds Where everything is understandable You don't have to say anything too loudI wish I knew how it would feel to be free I wish I could break all the chains holding me I wish I could say all the things that i should say Say 'em loud say 'em clear For the whole wide world to hear I wish I could share All the love thats in my heart Remove all the bars that keep us apart And I wish you could know how it feels to be me Then you'd see and agree that every man should be free I wish I could be like a bird in the sky How sweet it would be if I found I could fly Well I'd soar to the sun and look down at the sea And I sing cos I know how it feels to be free I wish I knew how it would feel to be free I wish I could break all the chains holding me And I wish I could say all the things that I wanna say Say 'em loud say 'em clear For the whole wide world to hear Say 'em loud say 'em clear For the whole wide world to hear Say 'em loud say 'em clear For the whole wide world to hearAin't no sunshine when she's gone It's not warm when she's away Ain't no sunshine when she's gone And she's always gone too long anytime she goes away Wonder this time where she's gone Wonder if she's gone to stay Ain't no sunshine when she's gone And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know Hey, I ought to leave the young thing alone But ain't no sunshine when she's gone Only darkness every day Ain't no sunshine when she's gone And this house just ain't no home Anytime she goes away Ain't no sunshine when she's gone It's not warm when she's away Ain't no sunshine when she's gone And she's always gone too long Anytime she goes away Anytime she goes away Anytime she goes away Anytime she goes away Anytime she goes away Can't see the truth in triggered words Don't need a mountain for a wall See the big old moon spin around the world Somehow it makes me feel so small I know I've been living the simple life Really that's the main thing Nowadays nobody speaks about The way they feel about things I know I need something to set me right Now it seems there's nothing and Nowadays nobody thinks about A way to ease the suffering Baby I know you're the first thing I believe in, honestly How do you prove what you can't see Well, it's a question of faith Baby I know you're the first thing I believe in, honestly Say you don't know enough about me Well, it's a question of faith Don't wanna complain, the weather could be worse But I wish I'd learnt from my mistakes Don't really need no clever words To understand what's in your face
