Hoodies Get you zeroed Skirts get you raped Destruction is constructive When the construct is destructive Verse 1:Siutations and stories Are behind crime basics People do only come On a case by case basis Preload prewrote laws Like you're covering bases Like if you dont spin em out You'll forget that you're racist Or the next fucker Could easy replace it With chaos like The one size one you've created In the lives of those You claim arent case by cases Cause you're justice unjust And can't fucking face it You'd rather send an armed idiot To make it, taze it Another life ruined by the system Doesn't phaze itIntro Whoever said a barking dog dont ever bite They never met a fuckin rapper in they life In a fervor yap yap yappin day and night Theyd rather jack another style thats tight Cause

with checks check u trainwrecks With checklists of yeses and nos-Studio got you on all foors, oh, no low blows Thot can't hear you on the floor, how low can u go Claim to ride-but your rider proved that was a lie You riding on a writer back no freestyles You ridin on a lotta dicks for free rides Youll ride to get a deal, clothing, cars-Youll ride to get a meal, hoing course Won't ride for any real fuckin causeTame the fake gangsters blare/Lameass studio chair revolutionaire/Came in without a care n left the game in disrepair/Shame my radio had ta bare/Same talent just ain't there/Names I loved never got much air/While punks missing dunks better fared/Dames only oversexed minds bare/As the hex of lacked clothes put on rap hoes out there/Now girls skimpy wear a fashion u dudes share/Oh dont like the truth got u scared  I don't care/Can't fight it/Oh wellâ€¦ life ain't fair/Try to bite it  /Check out my sig sauer there Real Hip Hops back this yearIntro :I told you not to compete But you stepped up I told you not to compete But you stepped up But you stepped up to me Yeah you stepped up You b a You stepped up Verse One:You can label me disgraceful Well your fables be distasteful You can't say I be unfaithful It's all in where I place my faith though Let you paint me as unstable Unbridled unchained Bustin through the gate too I may be out the bubble I made me out the struggle God made me out the rubble Where they all been buggin On what they been hatefully begrudging Been gratefully just bumpin to my own chords Never was just into one thing But I'm always into something No matter who where you is Can't touch this You a Judas   You a brutus I ain't Caesar so let's do this Ain't secret thought you knew this Just too complex for you to view this Can't see her Figure her out Rubix cube is Your feeble and frail Any feat never fail I succeed superceed Will prevail No longer mortal Invincible Cause every morsel Take in so I morph me to my frame Juice me like a morphie of pain Morphing your hate into morphine To my veins More you give The less I feel The more I gainNever realized many typa numbs one can feel From worst, "rather die/ too high a fee" typa deal To best of your life cause its being free typa feel That crazy nothin left numb is fun cause its real Being depressed numb without feeling Being restless numb which is fleeting Being stressed numb which is fleeing Beig   -ng reckless numb which is freeing Depressed, feel like fleeing, nothing    u can't flee, can't feel for real, boring Destressed, are fleeing, exciting, freeing, new numbness There are many types of death There are many types of life A person, a soul, an ego, a role Of freedom, lifestyle, a place u know Days gone or phase uve outgrown Or of a love of two souls as one Seperating and moving on alon V2 Then theres a type that combines them all It takes a lot more to set that off Than accident or disease to snuff Its a life that throws you tough Till you dont even notice nuffin Thats when shoulda chose enough But when u r accustomed to stuff You stop realizing youve had it rough Till something finally sets it off Blaw everything you knew is over now child Ready ur wiles to face the wild for a whileIntro Some people just take evetything away When a person who never sees cause only effect Meets a person who sees cause as pause to reject The former will be the latters human deathbed Because they project and never reflect so subject Themselves to eternal neglect of issues they erect V1 They think blame , shame and that game they project Solves it but its a temporary fix so they dont get it Why they keep getting shit, theyll just see the effdct They are the cause of in the one thry wrecked And blame that instead, while the person they decked Who knows too well , too much, other directon directs Knows power in taking responsibility can't change them Can change self in the end and so looks within Gains strength, wisdom, insight from hurt and chagrin But if two people are looking to place the buck On the one least likely to be the one fucking up Eventually there will be no more issues to remove And you ll see what I came to, it never was you Not maybe, a bit , it was true and now ur blue From the freeze that stolen ignorance wanna tell u Dont expect what you dont give cause u neglect to see its a choice we live Everythings cause and effect if u elect to erect cause of affects whichre negative And never check for punitive damages even when wreckage done is massiveDamage controls when image takes hold Can't manage your load so the luggage u tow Old adaged that holds but you just dont  know The garbage that slows thinkin think u do Cause  langauge of real things left untold That abridged version rehersed and told That imagined as ghosts allow them to grow With ur package of what you feel owed and owe Not knowledge, what you feel, reel from, n know Or courage, how you deal, heal from, n grow Holds hostage your appeal, steals your glow A dosage of the realness tho A passage thru the fake zeal u ho The blockage that u self impose That haulage that you need to peel fo A flowage to really let flow A drawbridge to your island alone A linkage for those who mow Through badshit so often go Thru breakage but they neva break tho The message of real will show The outrage, thats got to go Powa outagell kill you fasho That hard edge is deadly yoIntro You can't phaze me bitch Im Krazy as Drayz Think Kris and Pac: I just don't give a motherfuck I fight with flow so sick, you'll need a midol when I'm done But like my idol K RS-One, I may use words to herds incur to shun or stun or stunt But should it occur and the fun be done;Im also the one with the gun Chorus:I died in your arms tonight x8 Verse One Yo, I got no insecurity I got no fear in me That makes me love all of humanity But it makes me place no man above me So I don't care bout laws you see You really wanna fuck with me Cat got your tongue Gat not gonna get it done Armed to the teeth Put tongue and cheek Where speech can't reach If you don't practice what you preach If you punish but never reach If you leave what you bequeth If you talk big, but roll thirty deep
