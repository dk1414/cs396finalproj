I'm coming up only to hold you under I'm coming up only to show you're wrong And to know you is hard, we wonder To know you all wrong, we won Ooh Ooh Really too late to call so we wait for Morning to wake you is all we got And to know me as hardly golden Is to know me all wrong, they warn At every occasion, I'll be ready for the funeral At every occasion once more, it's called the funeral At every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral At every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral I'm coming up only to show you down for And coming up only to show you're wrong To the outside, the dead leaves lay on the lawn For they don't have trees to hang uponIt's looking like a limb torn off Or all together just taken apart We're reeling through an endless fall We are the ever-living ghost of what once was But no one is ever gonna love you more than I do No one's gonna love you more than I do And anything to make you smile It is a better side of you to admire But they should never take so long Just to be over then back to another one And no one is ever gonna love you more than I do No one's gonna love you more than I do But someone, they could have warned you When things start splitting at the seams and now The whole thing's tumbling down Things start splitting at the seams and now If things start splitting at the seams and now It's tumbling down hardWell I'd like to think I'm the mess You'd wear with pride Like some empty dress on the bed You've laid out for tonight Maybe I'll tell you sometime Time Sometime And you were right Right You were right Outside By your doorstep In a worn out Suit and tie I'll wait For you to come down Where you'll find me Where we'll shine Outside By your doorstep In a worn out Suit and tie I'll wait For you to come down Where you'll find me Where we'll shineSitting on a bearskin rug Listening to grandpa talk The whistle of an odd bird call A photo of the long lost dog Do you love me  Which one is it We should be living in a warehouse district I take the day and the lesson it taught me Passing off blame to anybody is easy But darling, you know it shouldn't be like that Can I go with you to the laundromat I found it in the drawer In the drawer, I found it in a Drawer Took a little time but now I found it a drawer Can't go on, no I'll go on Left it a long time ago In a drawer, hidden in a drawer I found it at the bottom, I found it in a drawer Can't go on, no I'll go on I found it in a drawer Do you love me And take a little walk when the worst is to come When I saw you lookin' like I never thought And say you're at a loss, or forgot That words can do more than harm Oh, oh, oh, oh The town is gonna talk, but these people do not See things through to the very minimal But what's it gonna cost to be gone If we see you like I hoped we never would Oh, oh, oh, oh When eyes can't look at you any other way Any other way, any other way When eyes can't look at you any other way Any other way, any other way So take it as a song or a lesson to learn And sometime soon be better than you were If you say you're gonna go, then be careful And watch how you treat every living soulIt's a, it's a complete farce Everything you do is a farce!Talking television at the casual party Here's some brand new friends to get you started off So start it off Since Ben got that he's a sociopath He's only playing games, don't be distracted It's all or nothing, all or nothing So you really got something to lose It's coming around as it did before Or it's gettin' your attention, but where's the door I can't locate it, where's it located I got plenty to live for Blind faith don't sit right You got rage, wound so tight I wanna leave, best get out of the way Blind faith don't sit right You're full of rage, wound so tight I'm gonna leave, best get out of the way Awful conversation at the casual party The jobs, babble on, the recreational hobbies No, it never stops Kids and the dog, a freshly mowed lawn Retirement plans for a mountain home Been arrested, lived in Texas My God, I'm gonna leave it with youI'll marry my lover in a place to admire, I don't Have to even ask her, I can look in her eyes and thank God That I am forgiven, or thank all of my friends To say I've been true, or they've forgotten And weary my mind is to say the least, it's been Awful hard to just stand on my feet, I think I'll slow down if I am able, I won't drown In the ocean or starve in my place at the table Lucky ones are we all 'til it is over Everyone near and far When you smile, the sun, it peeks through the clouds Never die, for always be around and around and around And how is your sister and what of your brother Extend hellos to your father and mother What in the world would cause you any sorrow Lighten your load and see how I keeled the wheelbarrow I borrowed Lucky ones are we all 'til it is over Everyone near and far When you smile the sun, it peeks through the clouds Never die, for always be around and around and aroundI had a dream, I had a dream That I was your neighbor, about to give birth and then Everything was really hurtin'And I was so lonely I didn't see it's like Living in a movie, twistin' the plot My friends and family, little things I got, I got When my thoughts drift to you I love the morning, I like to listen To 4 A M birdies begging to feed, now there's Something here before me, a figure I think Isn't there a warning or something to drink  My god, my god When my thoughts drift to you When my thoughts drift to you These mended bones, the storms approach Ever so slowly out on the sea, there's a Animal below me, lack of control Others came before me, others to come, to come When my thoughts drift to you When my thoughts drift to youSmall talk with a registered nurse Not to cry in front of people at work Well that's hard, hard, hard, at times you know You get reminded of the earlier days The end of April '78 That was a long, long, long, long time ago And you showed a lot of warning signs You made your own situation mine Now your problem's mine You don't want help You don't need me You don't look well And you don't want anything You don't want anything Slim pickings when the weather is snow Pretty winded on a bicycle It's been quite, quite, quite, quite a row to hoe A hot dinner on a souvenir plate The part of town where the money ain't But things are fine, fine, fine, we're on our ownJust the mentioning of Such a simple phrase Are we passengers on Separated trains Take the mask off When you speak to me And I'm alright to go on It's the little things But anymore, you've become Ethereal to everyone To everyone I'm reeling in the wrong day, getting behind Why didn't I think, "What in the world "It really took a tall one to see it, two to believe it Three to just get in the way All your life to think of What a mess you made Dig a hole in the ground For your wedding ring Rainmaker call Throw your hammer down And everything that I know Can't remember now
