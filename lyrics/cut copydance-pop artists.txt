your daughters and sons Oh, shine brother, shine on Oh, shine brighter than the sun Oh, you're golden, shine one All you gotta do is hold on If your head is heavy just stand up straight In these arms you're always welcome If you are a sinner or you are a saint Shine brighter, shine on Shine brighter than the sun Free your mind Free your mind Free your mind You gotta reach the sky if you want your life to shine You gotta reach the sky if you want your life to shineFind love, build it on sand Build it on bricks, build it on land Find love, swaying in the wind Watching it tumble, build it back again Find love, lying on the shore Or drifting out to sea, lost forevermore Find love, strangest of things The chaos inside, the peace that it brings Oh, oh, oh, watch me slowly fall apart You've gotta give up the things you love to make it better Been holding on, but all I'm holding on is hurt You've gotta give up the things you love to make it better Find love, build it on sand Build it on bricks, build it on land Find love, swaying in the wind Watching it tumble, build it back again Find love, lying on the shore Or drifting out to sea, lost forevermore Find love, strangest of things The chaos inside, the peace that it bringsCan you tell me a story from the end of the night Girl, you tell me to break the ice and the love will go fine Can you tell me you think straight  Plot a course in the landscape Just tell me you're fine We are the people, we are here alone We are explorers when the beat goes on We're on a journey to the morning sun Together Got a face for the front page, you should join me sometime I wanna dream up a new age if the planets align With a hunger for never, windows stretching forever Just tell me you're fine We are the people, we are here alone We are explorers when the beat goes on We're on a journey to the morning sun Together You'll get through with a little love Just you wait and see You'll get through with a little love Just you wait and seeDon't need to pray Don't need to bow But we are true believers when the sun goes down Here on the rock Look out in space Don't need no gravity to hold our love in place The solar heat Get off your seat And carve our names into place where planets meet Sharpen up your knives But not to kill We're gonna slice the night right open, let it spill Oh, let me show you Let me show you love Oh, let me show you Let me show you love Oh, let me show you Let me show you love Oh, let me show you You've got to live right now {right now)Don't need to think Just got to do Move to the rhythms of the universe, it's true I'm ready to go Just seize the day If you need to ask, you'll never know that's what they sayMidnight’s crazy when you’re down Plant your tears in the ground Dream plantations slowly grow Until they cover your sorrow It’s hard to love…Living here…That don’t stop me Walk for years, desert man Footprints swallowed in the sand Makes me dizzy this city of mine Jagged teeth, made of glass, rising up and meet me in the sky It’s hard to love…Living here…That don’t stop me I don’t remember this place at all Just that I’m dreaming of somewhere else I don’t remember this place at all Just that I’m dreaming of somewhere elseI woke up, but was far from home Living a life that was not my own Oh, oh Places familiar but they're not the same A house of strangers who all know my name Oh, oh I wait for the penny drop, hey!I'm never going to give you up, my love Black rainbows never stop, hey!I'm never going to give you up, my love Whispers and lies The ghost in your eyes They burn paradise Black rainbows for miles Turn up the volume, all the way it goes There's only silence on the radio Oh, oh Forgot the songs that I used to know I had it all but I, I let it go!Oh, ohHush darling, don't you cry Hush darling, don't you cry Cause they're never gonna reach you Never gonna reach you Hush darling, don't you cry Hush darling, don't you cry Cause they're never gonna reach you Never gonna reach you In the morning I come down In the morning I break down But you're never gonna get away Gonna get away I know I'm running baby But I need you now Said I know we're going crazy But I need you now I need you now To fight somehow There's a beauty in the waking night There's a memory waking up But it's never gonna reach you Never gonna reach youDon't shed your tears Just meet me in a house of love You know when you're there because the colors just soak you up Once I was lost but in this house I can be found Feel like the sun, we're rising and we won't come down Into to the night Into forever Let's come together like the brightest stars Into to the night Into forever Let's come together like the brightest stars It's cold in the street But we can build a house of love We hold up the walls, the lovers in the yearning hearts Once I was lost but in this house I can be found Feel like the sun, we're rising and we won't come down Into to the night Into forever Let's come together like the brightest stars Into to the night Into forever Let's come together like the brightest starsTell you all my fears Losing loves and fading years But I'm still saving all my tears They wouldn't go to waste No matter what you do to turn it down No matter what you do to hide the sound All your clocks are slowly counting down Love will save us, love will save us Watch the world outside Your memories fade and people die But I'll keep dreams alive No matter what you do to turn it down No matter what you do to hide the sound All your clocks are slowly counting down Love will save us, love will save us Darkness, night time Diamonds, be mine Darkness, night time Diamonds, be mine Under the mountains, quarry towns I spent ten years there underground To find what sparkles in the lightDo you hear that voice inside your head Whispering to live your dreams instead Some people cling to what they know But I woke up, now it's time to go Ooh, I can hear it calling Ooh, did you see me fall in and out of love Ooh, I can hear it calling Ooh, did you see me fall in Take me over Now take me out Give me something To dream about Take me over, take me out To the jungle through the night in paradise, paradise Take me over, take me out To the jungle through the night forever Hold the things seen only on the screen Of printer columns, that's no way to live City's memories from this stereo But don't sleep cause now it's time to go
