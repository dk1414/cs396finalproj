Life is so strange when you don't know How can you tell where you're going to You can't be sure of any situation Something could change and then you won't know You ask yourself Where do we go from here It seems so all too near Just as far beyond as I can see I still don't know what this all means to me So you tell yourself I have nowhere to go I don't know what to do And I don't even know the time of day I guess it doesn't matter anyway Life is so strange Destination unknown When you don't know Your destination And something could change It's unknown And then you won't know Destination unknownDo you hear me Do you care Do you hear me Do you care My lips are moving and the sound's coming out The words are audible but I have my doubts That you realize what has been said You look at me as if you're in a daze It's like the feeling at the end of the page When you realize you don't know what you just read What are words for when no one listens anymore What are words for when no one listens What are words for when no one listens it's no use talkin' at all I might as well go up and talk to a wall'cause all the words are having no effect at all It's a funny thing, am I all alone Something has to happen to change the direction What little filters through is giving you the wrong impression It's a sorry state, I say to myself What are words for when no one listens anymore What are words for when no one listens What are words for when no one listens it's no use talkin at allLook ahead as we pass, try and focus on it I won't be fooled by a cheap cinema trick It must have been just a cardboard cut out of a man Top forty cast off from a record stand Walkin' in L.A Nobody walks in L.A I don't know could've been a lame jogger maybe Or someone just about to do the freeway strangler baby Shopping cart pusher or maybe someone groovy One thing's for sure, he isn't starring in the movies Cause he's—You won't see a cop walkin' on the beat You only see 'em drivin' cars out on the street You won't see a kid walkin' home from school Their mothers pick 'em up in a car poolMy image is hard, my attitude heavy I take you out with the things that I say I draw the crowds and whenever I'm ready I've got what it takes to blow them all away I am your social and your cultural leader I create the fads and make all the scenes You know about me from your weekly reader I'm on the cover of your magazines'Cause I am one of the noticeable ones - notice me I am one of the noticeable ones - notice me I am one of the noticeable ones, notice me - notice me Notice me - noticeable one I am one of the noticeable ones, notice me - notice me Notice me - noticeable one My private life is scandalized by the public But that's the price I have to pay for my fame And all the liggers in my way with their cute tricks Are getting over just by dropping my name'Cause I am one of the noticeable ones - notice me I am one of the noticeable ones - notice meSomething feels so strange tonight It's not wrong but it's just not right Some hidden complications Fill me with hesitation And it gets so dark in here I can't see through doubts and fears Walled in by expectation I need a deviation Change in perspective, alternative view To help me see clearly, observe something new All I want is a window to look through All I need is a window to look through It's the only thing that I really wanna do anyway All I want is a window to look through All I need is a window to look through It's the only thing that I really wanna do anywayYou can feel it closing in on you but there's not much you can do It's not a thing you can put your finger on, but you know when it's gone Endless stream of highways neon roadsigns and telephone lines A little town somewhere in the mid-west gonna put your patience to the test It's the U.S  Drag U.S  Drag It's the U.S  Drag There ain't no drag like the U.S  Drag Music down the windy street, half a glance from strangers you don't wanna meet Juke box blaring, stale beat, mixes with gamblers, gangsters boredom and fear, in the pale blue T.V  light It's the U.S  Drag U.S  Drag It's the U.S  Drag There ain't no drag like the U.S  Drag And it's closin' in on you It's the U.S  Drag It's the U.S  Drag And there's nothing you can do U.S  Drag U.S  Drag It's the U.S  Drag It's the U.S  DragSometimes you say you will sometimes you say you won't You always keep me waiting waiting hesitating hey yeah At times I think you do at times I think you don't My mind is rollerskating, skipping, jumping rope, and fading Mental Hopscotch Why must you treat me this way Mental Hopscotch Ready or not I'm going away Why can't you be like this why can't you be like that I don't know where I am, or where or where I'm at So now you got me up and now you got me down You won't be walking you'll be talking Watch me now it's crazy Mental Hopscotch Why must you treat me this way Mental Hopscotch Ready or not I'm going away Mental Hopscotch Cover your eyes and count to 10 Mental Hopscotch Don't do a em up till I say when So now you get me up and now you get me downLife is so strange when you don't know How can you tell where you're going to You can't be sure of any situation Something could change and then you won't know You ask yourself Where do we go from here It seems so all too near Just as far beyond as I can see I still don't know what this all means to me So you tell yourself I have nowhere to go I don't know what to do And I don't even know the time of day I guess it doesn't matter anyway Life is so strange Destination unknown When you don't know Your destination And something could change It's unknown And then you won't know Destination unknownDo you hear me Do you care Do you hear me Do you care My lips are moving and the sound's coming out The words are audible but I have my doubts That you realize what has been said You look at me as if you're in a daze It's like the feeling at the end of the page When you realize you don't know what you just read What are words for when no one listens anymore What are words for when no one listens What are words for when no one listens it's no use talkin' at all I might as well go up and talk to a wall'cause all the words are having no effect at all It's a funny thing, am I all alone Something has to happen to change the direction What little filters through is giving you the wrong impression It's a sorry state, I say to myself What are words for when no one listens anymore What are words for when no one listens What are words for when no one listens it's no use talkin at allLook ahead as we pass, try and focus on it I won't be fooled by a cheap cinema trick It must have been just a cardboard cut out of a man Top forty cast off from a record stand Walkin' in L.A Nobody walks in L.A I don't know could've been a lame jogger maybe Or someone just about to do the freeway strangler baby Shopping cart pusher or maybe someone groovy One thing's for sure, he isn't starring in the movies Cause he's—You won't see a cop walkin' on the beat You only see 'em drivin' cars out on the street You won't see a kid walkin' home from school Their mothers pick 'em up in a car pool
