My first love was a wicked twisted road I hit the million-mile mark at seventeen years old I never saw the rainbow, much less a pot of gold Yeah, my first love was a wicked twisted road My first love was a castle in the sky Never thought I'd make it 'til I had the guts to try Then I sat up in my tower while the whole world passed me by Yeah, my first love was a castle in the sky My first love was a fearless drivin' rain Scared to death I thought I'd never see her face again They say God was cryin' so I guess he felt my pain My first love was a fearless drivin' rain My first love was a wild sinful night I ran out with the big dogs, guess I had more bark than bite I know I won the battle, but in the end I lost the fight Yeah, my first love was a wild sinful nightThe first pub we could stagger to was twelve steps from the plane A Virgin flight to Shannontown the day it didn't rain The laughing eyes of Ireland sparkling blue and green With hair as black as Guinness stout and barely seventeen We're back out on the cobblestones Whiskey drunk and high again Liquored up and gearing up for seven nights in Ireland The corner booth is waiting for the session to begin It's quiet as a mother's prayer 'till we all stumble in And it's fifty happy voices mixed with whistles made of tin And a piper man is blowing like the North Atlantic wind And an Erin Island beauty is sawing on the violin I wonder will she miss me after seven nights in Ireland It's Ladies' Day in Galway and we watched the ponies run Fifty pounds against the odds and came in six to one Mc Swiggin heard the race report, he invited us on in So we drank Catholic whiskey with all our newfound friends They raised a glass to all of us and we all toasted them Here's to Michael, Tom and Pat and seven nights in Ireland Well we kissed all the girls goodbye and gathered in our gear And when she walked me to the gate I swear I saw a tear But then she looked into my eyes I knew she felt my pain And only then I realized we were standing in the rainMy first love was a wicked twisted road I hit the million mile mark at seventeen years old I never saw the rainbow much less a pot of gold Yeah, my first love was a wicked twisted road My first love was a castle in the sky Never thought I'd make it 'til I had the guts to try And I sat up in my tower while the whole world passed me by Yeah, my first love was a castle in the sky My first love was a fearless drive in rain Scared to death I thought I'd never see her face again They say God was crying so I guess he felt my pain My first love was a fearless drive in rain My first love was a wild sinful night I ran out with the big dogs, guess I had more bark than bite And though I won the battle, in the end I lost the fight Yeah, my first love was a wild sinful night My first love was an angry, painful song I wanted one so bad, I went and did everything wrong A lesson in reality would come before too long Yeah, my first love was an angry, painful song My first love was a wicked twisted road I hit the million mile mark at seventeen years old I never saw the rainbow much less a pot of gold Yeah, my first love was a wicked twisted roadWell it sure didn't take too long I woke up one mornin', she was gone And the note that she wrote didn't say "Dear John"It said, "Goodbye, sucker, I'm gone!"She was a home-grown mountain girl Raised in a different world I was a wanna-be rocker, she was more into Merle And I couldn't see it just wouldn't work And now I'm double fisting longnecks And grapefruit and Stoli But I'm never gettin' over Jolie Well I pulled myself in my car I drove it on down to the bar But they wouldn't let me in, 'cause I ain't a movie star So I went to the Horseshoe on Lamar The bouncer threw me out at two And I didn't know what to do So I picked up the phone and I called guess who But the call block wouldn't let me throughA promise is just a truth til it makes someone a liar Seldom all the honor till they're held against the fire Forgivness is a luxury we seldom can't afford Until the cost is greater, of which cannot be ignored I didn't mean to let you down I didn't mean you any harm All I needed was a friend I didn't mean to break your heart A diamond is just some coal that's been beaten to the ground Till its picked up by a man so he can kick some hearts around A tear is just a drop of water fallin from the sky Till it quenches someones thirst, only then, can it be cried I didn't mean to let you down I didn't mean you any harm All I needed was a friend I didn't mean to break your heart A rock is just a rock until it rolls on down the road And if it doesn't gather moss then it might be a rollin stone Dust is just some dirt till its picked up by the wind If it blows around the world, then it might make it back again I didn't mean to let you down I didn't mean you any harm All I needed was a friend I didn't mean to break your heart Luck is just a pencil lyin broken at my feet Till I picked it up, then its journey was complete Will it give me one last letter Will it write you one more song Or is it just some lead & wood, the magic all but gone I didn't mean to let you down I didn't mean you any harm All I needed was a friend I didn't mean to break your heart I didn't mean to break your heart I didn't mean to break your heartI can make you a believer in fate Divine intervention and signs of the sun You came to me not a moment too late With death at my door and time on the run And destiny surrounds you But now that I've found you I'm never gonna let you go I'd be lost without you now I'm never gonna let you go You're the one sure thing I've found So you better stick around I can feel you from across the room Laughing eyes are staring me down You come to me not a moment too soon Revealing your secrets without a sound And mystery surrounds you Baby now that I've found you I'm never gonna let you go I'd be lost without you now I'm never gonna let you go You're the one sure thing I've found So you better stick aroundYou're hiding from love You see you don't need it But if that were true You could take it or leave it Well you gotta learn to walk But you're afraid of fallin'Off the line like a shot Then it's back to crawling How can it stop if you won't let it start I build it up and you tear it apart It's so hard to love a girl with a broken heart I love a girl with a broken heart You still lickin' your wounds And girl you're no stranger To blood, sweat and tears And a heart scared from anger We got a love that you find Maybe once in a lifetime But you can't hide From from a memory of the first time How can it stop if you won't let it start I build it up and you tear it apart It's so hard to love a girl with a broken heart I love a girl with a broken heartThe first man that you ever loved Left your mama and never said goodbye to anyone And you were raised with your head held high But any fool can see it's just a clever disguise You're nobody's baby You're nobody's darlin'You're nobody's girl You've always been a little scared to open your heart And you never let anybody take it too far You never let ?em on the inside'Cause you're always scared you'll be taken for a ride You're nobody's baby You're nobody's darlin'You're nobody's girl Everybody wants you but you don't want to care So you keep ?em at a distance with the frown you wear You spend your time trying to even the score And you've got it in your head you deserve a lot more The first one was a true disaster So was the second one and every one after But when you're breaking in a broken home You're gonna be sure to spend some nights on your ownHey Ol' Lady let's go To the Motel Cowboy Show We'll drink and dance There's no place else to go We'll stay out all night long We'll toast the break of dawn Hey Ol' Lady let's go To the Motel Cowboy Show Well they rolled one for the road Put on the same dirty ol' clothes Down the trail they rode To the Motel Cowboy Show Well they parked at the end of the line Underneath the cold beer sign It's a long long way to ride Without your whiskey and your wine Something stronger would be fine Something stronger would be fine I said Hey Ol' Lady lets go To the Motel Cowboy Show We'll drink and dance There's no place else to go We'll hang out all night long We'll toast the break of dawn Hey Ol' Lady let's go To the Motel Cowboy ShowSadie got a six gun She ain't afraid to use it The banker took us straight down To the safe and I blew it The sheriff heard a big bang In the broad daylight And by the time the smoke cleared We were nowhere in sight Sadie got an Mustang An old '64 Sadie got the top down And her foot to the floor Lights in the rearview Got the fuzz on our tail Better give me that scattergun, baby I ain't goin' back to jail Sadie got a hideout Off of 71 We'll count up all the money Ditch the car and the guns Sadie says she loves me I'll always be her man"And I'll see you in Rio honey We gotta stick to the plan"
