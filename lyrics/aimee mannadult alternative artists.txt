Nothing is holding you back now No one can push you around What do you wanna do You're the master of you And isn't the thought enough to lift you off of the ground Nothing is holding me back now No one can push me around What do I wanna be I'm the master of me And isn't the thought enough to lift me off of the ground We could be independent together Independent together, we can fly Independent together Independent together Independent together, you and I High above an endless sea No one brought us here but me Every step and every choice It's my fault, it's my thought, it's my words, it's my voiceYou look like A perfect fit For a girl in need Of a tourniquet But can you save me Come on and save me If you could save me From the ranks of the freaks Who suspect They could never love anyone'Cause I can tell You know what it's like The long farewell Of the hunger strike But can you save me Come on and save me If you could save me From the ranks of the freaks That suspect They could never love anyoneIt's not what you thought When you first began it You got what you want Now you can hardly stand it, though By now you know It's not going to stop It's not going to stop It's not going to stop Till you wise up You're sure there's a cure And you have finally found it You think one drink Will shrink you till you're underground And living down But it's not going to stop It's not going to stop It's not going to stop Till you wise upLookin' into the face of the goose snow cone Should be shaking it loose but you do it alone Every look is a truce and it's written in stone Gotta keep it together when your friends come by Always checking the weather but they wanna know why Even birds of a feather find it hard to fly Thought I saw at my feet an origami crow It was only the street hidden under the snow Always snatching defeat, it's the devil I know Gotta keep it together when your friends come by Always checking the weather but they wanna know why Even birds of a feather find it hard to fly Lookin' into the face of the goose snow cone I could pick up the pace but I couldn't go on I just wanted a place but I ended up gone Gotta keep it together when your friends come by Always checking the weather but they wanna know why Even birds of a feather find it hard to flyBoy, when you go, you go Three thousand miles just so I'll know You never loved me You never loved me Then when you're gone, you're gone I know the tumbleweed lexicon:You never loved me You never loved me Three thousand miles to sit in a room With a vanishing groom'Til it undoes me A helium cell like a hermit crab shell Was a blank, you could tell It never was me'Cause you will never love me You never loved me Boy, when you're through, you're through Nobody argues the point like you You never loved me You never loved meThey served you champagne like a hero When you landed, someone carried your bag From here on out, you're patient zero Smelling ether as they hand you the rag Life is good You look around and think I'm in the right neighborhood But, honey, you just moved in Life is grand And wouldn't you like To have it go as planned Go as planned Hip hip hooray, hocus pocus With some magic you can fly through the air But when you're the guy pulling focus There are people who will wish you weren't there Life is good You look around and think I'm in the right neighborhood But, honey, you just moved in Life is grand And wouldn't you like To have it go as planned Go as plannedWhat a waste of a smoke machine Took the taste of the dopamine And left me high and dry Call the cops, call the cavalry Spin the tops that'll dazzle me And give me a new supply There's a layer below, underneath all the layers that I knew So I pay when you go but it only convinces me that you are Good for me Good for Just a little bit of what I need To soothe an appetite that I can't feed Isn't that good for me Accessorizing before the fact Alibis couldn't stay intact As guilty as a gun So you dig, so you move some earth Tunnel down out of Leavenworth Or set the fuse and run Blasting deep underground, getting down to the Continental Shelf I'll pretend I'm surprised by the lies that I'm telling to myself That you're good for me Good for me Good forRollercoasters and ferris wheels You like how it feels'Round and 'round 'til you lose yourself in the air All those complicated deals Your desperate appeals Calling out to a god you know isn't there So high as you fell looking down on the tops of the trees And all you can do is say"Please, please, baby, please Please, please, baby, please"You were conjuring that year A ghost engineer Building gods who could put the clock in reverse Breathing thinner atmosphere So thin you could hear Angels telling you "boy, you're making it worse"So high as you fell looking down on the tops of the trees And all you can do is say"Please, please, baby, please Please, please, baby, please"Now that I've met you Would you object to Never seeing each other again 'Cause I can't afford to Climb aboard you No one's got that much ego to spend So don't work your stuff Because I've got troubles enough No, don't pick on me When one act of kindness could be Deathly Deathly Deathly'Cause I'm just a problem For you to solve and Watch dissolve in the heat of your charm But what will you do when You run it through and You can't get me back on the farm So don't work your stuff Because I've got troubles enough No, don't pick on me When one act of kindness could be Deathly Deathly Deathly DefinitelyThe moth don't care when he sees the flame He might get burned, but he's in the game And once he's in, he can't go back He'll beat his wings till he burns them black No, the moth don't care when he sees the flame No, the moth don't care when he sees the flame The moth don't care if the flame is real'Cause flame and moth got a sweetheart deal And nothing fuels a good flirtation Like need and anger and desperation No, the moth don't care if the flame is real No, the moth don't care if the flame is real So come on, let's go, ready or not'Cause there's a flame I know, hotter than hot And with a fuse that's so thoroughly shot, away The moth don't care if the flame burns low'Cause moth believes in an afterglow And flames are never doused completely All you really need is the love of heat No, the moth don't care if the flame burns low No, the moth don't care if the flame burns low
