complaining I never tried to feel I never tried to feel this vibration I never tried to reach I never tried to reach your edenI, I do stumble Stumble and fall over you You trip every night Trip every day over me When we try to swim We're drowning even harder Gravity controls, gravity controls The way we're falling Gravity controls, gravity controls The way we sink We're floating into space, floating into space So boy, why don't you kiss me Waves suck you down To the bottom of the deep, dark sea A twister lifts me up'Til the point I can't breath When we try to jump The floor is even harderRelease me Don't talk, go away Release me It's not right to make me stay All the lies and all the pain Only you can make them go away Yeah, release me from this sad and losing game Release me Don't say what I already know Release me Only trouble steals the show All those words won't comfort me It's clear we are not meant to be Yeah, release me from this sad and losing game You're all I want A dangerous need It's wrong to keep you close to me And if you dare, if you care Then cut the ropes and float away Yeah, release me, if you love me let me goMorning, sunshine You are always smiling when I open my My eyes do shine Radiate like a nuclear dense cloud You're like a real strong cup of tea Giving me more than energy Caffeine is just a small advance For all the triggers that make me Na nana nana nananana Boy, you make me dance Na nana nana nananana You put me in a trance Good night sleep tight Feels as if I could swim across the ocean My Film star playing the Lead in my nightly stop motion Ginseng is weak compared to you I'm wandering round without a clue By enforcing my sweet fantasy My pheromones are making meI like the things that you hate And you hate the things that I like But it hurts Honesty's your church But sometimes It's better to lie But sometimes It's better to lie I am the vinegar and salt And you are the oil that dissolves My frustration Honesty's limitations But sometimes It's better to lie But sometimes It's better to lie But sometimes It's better to lie But sometimes It's better to lie But sometimes But sometimes But sometimes But sometimes
