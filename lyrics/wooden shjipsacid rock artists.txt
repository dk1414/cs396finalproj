I was feeling alone Staring at the sun Crowds of people walk on by What a feeling to rise above clouds Ashes falling around the town Burning up  rolling down along the corner Does it ease you now around the town Everything is about living a long time The sun rises and hears about what Things won't work out I 'm feeling fine Sitting in the sun Drops of rain and please won't come Fading's on my mind Thoughts were on pleasing and working out There wanna see Fading into  on my mind Run around the town Chasing dreams Where are all the girls What do they mean to me Roll lazy bone'Til I'm rolling on the floor Feeling very low Feeling lost Falling down the sea What is it that you see Double down and I choke Take me down for good I got a lot to bear Underneath Lighting all the fires, watch them burn into the night I wanna feel the sun In this frozen sea I wanna feel your arm Crawling over me Take me to your home Take me all around No-one has to know On the other, chasing after ghosts In the autumn noon tree Staring at the sun, is it staring back at me When the moon rise I'down Soon as 'down the street And I travel down When the dark And it so simple how For the The sky braking down Get the feeling Ooh this shadows And this nothing I can accept  down I'm just sitting for the way You've been sitting downUnder my skin, chases after all the blues Look out for the king, in the writers and lost This will be uncertain this will be ruins Born in the light, cast a shadow of our love Thinking the sun, blurring innocence of tired We all know, you all wrong Out of the night, was so long I can't recall Chasing after night, at the end of so to fall Did you know so much home Lost the purpose execution Every knows, wouldn't be so easy We've only hold a dreamI was feeling alone Staring at the sun Crowds of people walk on by What a feeling to rise above clouds Ashes falling around the town Burning up  rolling down along the corner Does it ease you now around the town Everything is about living a long time The sun rises and hears about what Things won't work out I 'm feeling fine Sitting in the sun Drops of rain and please won't come Fading's on my mind Thoughts were on pleasing and working out There wanna see Fading into  on my mind Run around the town Chasing dreams Where are all the girls What do they mean to me Roll lazy bone'Til I'm rolling on the floor Feeling very low Feeling lost Falling down the sea What is it that you see Double down and I choke Take me down for good I got a lot to bear Underneath Lighting all the fires, watch them burn into the night I wanna feel the sun In this frozen sea I wanna feel your arm Crawling over me Take me to your home Take me all around No-one has to know On the other, chasing after ghosts In the autumn noon tree Staring at the sun, is it staring back at me When the moon rise I'down Soon as 'down the street And I travel down When the dark And it so simple how For the The sky braking down Get the feeling Ooh this shadows And this nothing I can accept  down I'm just sitting for the way You've been sitting downUnder my skin, chases after all the blues Look out for the king, in the writers and lost This will be uncertain this will be ruins Born in the light, cast a shadow of our love Thinking the sun, blurring innocence of tired We all know, you all wrong Out of the night, was so long I can't recall Chasing after night, at the end of so to fall Did you know so much home Lost the purpose execution Every knows, wouldn't be so easy We've only hold a dream
