Hey girl, you know you drive me crazy One look puts the rhythm in my hand Still, I'll never understand why you hang around I see what's going down Cover up with makeup in the mirror Tell yourself, "It's never gonna happen again"You cry alone, and then He swears he loves you Do you feel like a man when you push her around Do you feel better now, as she falls to the ground Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found A pebble in the water makes a ripple effect Every action in this world'll bear a consequence If you wade around forever, you will surely drown I see what's going down I see the way you go and say you're right again Say you're right again, heed my lectureWhen I see your smile Tears run down my face I can't replace And now that I'm stronger, I have figured out How this world turns cold and breaks through my soul And I know, I'll find deep inside me I can be the one I will never let you fall I'll stand up with you forever I'll be there for you through it all Even if saving you sends me into heaven It's okay, it's okay, it's okay Seasons are changing And waves are crashing And stars are falling all for us Days grow longer and nights grow shorter I can show you I'll be the one I will never let you fall I'll stand up with you forever I'll be there for you through it all Even if saving you sends me into heavenOh, it's time to let it go The world's got a funny way of turning round on you When a friend tries to stab you right in the face Losing faith in everything I thought, I hoped and knew Don't sweat it Set a false pretense Betray, you're not gonna be willing to change Yeah, and it doesn't seem likely to fade Betray, you're not gonna be willing to change Ca-ca-ca-ca-cause you know In sacrifice False pretense, you'll hurt again Stop pretending to deny False pretense, you'll hurt again All along you know you thought you got the best of me You were wrong and I'm laughing right in your face I cannot believe you claimed you were my family Don't sweat it Set a false pretense Betray, you're not gonna be willing to change Yeah, and it doesn't seem likely to fade Betray, you're not gonna be willing to change Ca-ca-ca-ca-cause you knowWhen I see your smile Tears run down my face I can't replace And now that I'm stronger I've figured out How this world turns cold and it breaks through my soul And I know I'll find deep inside me I can be the one I will never let you fall I'll stand up with you forever I'll be there for you through it all Even if saving you sends me to heaven It's okay It's okay It's okay Seasons are changing And waves are crashing and stars are falling All for us Days grow longer and nights grow shorter I can show you I'll be the oneSoftly we tremble tonight Picture perfect fading smiles are all that's left in sight I said, I'd never leave, you'll never change I'm not satisfied with where I'm at in life Am I supposed to be happy When all I ever wanted, it comes with a price Am I supposed to be happy When all I ever wanted, it comes with a price You said, you said that you would die for me We made plans to grow old Believe me there was truth in all those stories that I told Lost in a simple game, cat and mouse, are we the same People as before this came to light Am I supposed to be happy When all I ever wanted, it comes with a price Am I supposed to be happy When all I ever wanted, it comes with a price You said, you said that you would die for meThe moon is shining bright The mood is feeling right I'll kiss you on your neck People will stare but we won't care We're high above the ground We're nowhere to be found Empowered by adrenaline Feel like I'm born again Again I am repeating myself And I know it is time for you To sit and pretend Damn regret I'll try to forget Don't worry about me'Cause I'll be fine Cast my line To see what's behind Did you think you'd persuade me to let you go I'm wishing you were here My weakness is my fear Alone I am myself No reason left for me to care Distracted by the sound I hear footsteps all around Empowered by adrenaline Feel like I'm born again Again I am repeating myself And I know it is time for you To sit and pretendI remember a year ago, I was standing in the crowd Waiting for my chance to break through My chance to live again And now it seems I've found some friends who finally understand What it takes to make this dream come true We'll be here 'til the end Shake it, break it, get off your feet Come dance with me and don't you fake it Shake it, break it, get off your feet Get close to me and don't you fake it Shout  and  scream , my friends Connect  with me  and we'll pretend This night will never end , this night will never end Just  let  go , you'll see Together , we'll do  anything This night will never end , this night will never end Shake it, break it, get off your feet Come dance with me and don't you fake it Shake it, break it, get off your feet Get close to me and don't you fake itOnce there was a time when we could learn All the simple pleasantries a follower should yearn Now all that I can do is watch them burn And wish that I could save them all, or just one See the fake, everyday shaking hands of men, promising the end Hear Him speak of all the things that we need to hear, to adhere Justify, your secrecies that surmise your cries I see the way you look around the bend Is it going to end, yeah, when The visions that I've seen have left me torn Between the resurrection and the prophecy unborn I think that I will document the fall And say I hate to say it, but I told you all See the fake, everyday shaking hands of men, promising the end Hear Him speak of all the things that we need to hear, to adhere Justify, your secrecies that surmise your cries I see the way you look around the bend Is it going to end, yeah, when Justify, your secrecies that surmise your cries I see the way you look around the bend Is it going to end, when Listen close, as the rain falls down to the ground It's true We are, we are destined to fail It's true We are, we are destined to fail There is a problem here, with our society The absence of my tears is my sobriety I have a growing fear, and you're not helping me Am I the only one who realizes it's true Beat but I'm not broken Guide me through with your hand Lead with your words spoken Show me how to listen!You're persecuting me, showing hypocrisy I have a remedy for your insecurity It's all the same sadly, nobody works for free Am I the only one who realizes it's true Beat but I'm not broken Guide me through with your hand Lead with your words spoken Show me how to listen When I see your smile Tears run down my face I can't replace And now that I'm stronger I've figured out How this world turns cold and it breaks through my soul And I know I'll find deep inside me I can be the one I will never let you fall I'll stand up with you forever I'll be there for you through it all Even if saving you sends me to heaven It's okay It's okay It's okay Seasons are changing And waves are crashing and stars are falling All for us Days grow longer and nights grow shorter I can show you I'll be the one I will never let you fall I'll stand up with you forever I'll be there for you through it all Even if saving you sends me to heaven
