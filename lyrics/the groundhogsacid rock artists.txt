My garden is all overgrown And the weeds are creeping up on my home Grass has grown over two-foot-high And the trees are blocking out the sky French windows won't open anymore From the moss that's grown outside the door A hundred birds are nesting in the trees Looks like a wild-life sanctuary But I'm not going to cut a single blade of grass My garden will look just like the distant past Before the days of agricultural land Before the time when pebbles turned to sand When I leave this house I'm going to stay I'm forsaking my comforts to live another way Get my clothes from heaps, my food from bins My water from ponds and have tramps for all my friends But I'm not going to cut a single blade of grass My garden will look just like the distant past Before the days of agricultural land Before the time when pebbles turned to sand When I leave this house I'm going to stay I'm forsaking my comforts to live another way Get my clothes from heaps, my food from bins My water from ponds and have tramps for all my friendsI'm like a ship on the ocean that's rolling from side to side But I'm not drunk I'm just dissatisfied It's not my body but my mind I can't control I have everything I need but still..  I want more I've done everything that I've ever set out to do I become so well known that they've put me in who's who But I've reached the limit and I don't know what to do If I can't go no further I'll have to go back..  to being poorIn 1914 a war began A million soldiers lent a hand Weren't many planes to give support Hand to hand was the way they fought Young men were called up for the cause For king and country and the cross In their naivete they thought It was for the glory, so they'd been taught In 1939 once again There came the sound of marching men Occupying European land All the way to North French sands But, in the final year of that war Two big bangs settled the score Against Japan, who'd joined the fight The rising sun didn't look so bright Since that day it's been stalemate Everyone's scared to obliterate So it seems for peace we can thank the bomb So I say thank Christ for the bomb So I say thank Christ for the bomb So I say thank Christ for the bombThis is a strange town, people here round don't have no fun I've been here two years, I've been lookin' round but I ain't found none It seems that all they care about is pointin' people out Saying stupid things like, "get the lice out your hair"I don't believe these people, spend all their time walkin' round lookin' so glum They think that life is for workin' to secure their pension when retirement come Ah, but they don't realise, it's right before their eyes Life is for livin', right now before you die This is a strange town, people here round don't have no fun I've been here two years, I've been lookin' round but I ain't found none It seems that all they care about is pointin' people out Saying stupid things like, "get the lice out your hair"My baby just mistreats me night and day My baby just mistreats me night and day Ah, she mistreats the poor boy just to pass the time away Baby, what have I done that's wrong Baby, what have I done that's wrong Ah, you mistreat me baby, drive me from your home Now please don't mistreat me, 'cos you know I'm young and wild And please don't mistreat me, 'cos you know I'm young and wild Ah, you must always remember, one time you was a child Baby, what have I done that's wrong Baby, what have I done that's wrong Ah, you mistreat the poor boy, drive him from your home I do all I can just to make you satisfied If you don't appreciate me, you can go 'cos you ain't tied But I know, if you leave me, I'll miss you most at night Baby, what have I done that's wrong Baby, what have I done that's wrong Oh, you mistreat me baby and drive me from your home Baby, what have I done that's wrong Baby, what have I done that's wrong Ah, you mistreat the poor boy and drive me from your homeWell, now, there's two, there's two trains running Well, they ain't never, no, going my way Well, now, one run at midnight and the other one Running just 'fore day It's running just 'fore day It's running just 'fore day Oh Lord  sure 'nough they is Oh well Mm mm, ho ho ho, somebody help me, ho, with these blues Well, now, she's the one I'm loving, she's the one I do hate to lose I do hate to lose I do hate to lose Oh Lord, sure 'nough I do Oh well I been crazy;
