way of making income Six hundred suit guarantees you won't look like a bum Mighty corporations I can hear them laughing Marketing managers got you under their thumbDolled up in neon strut your wares down the street All the nouveau stars and starlets starin' at your sweet You pot an underground Babylon of rock and roll Always catch the last set to play as the night gets old Oh babe, It may be quite good But it's not quite as good as It should Oh babe, It ain't Hollywood Now I got a band I'll take to where the noise don't stop Loud coloured lights so bright that's where I wanna bop The glamour and the fashion so hot it Just makes you shake Who cares about tomorrow It's Just another chance you take This ain't Hollywood you know It's only New York This ain't Hollywood you know it's only L.A This ain't Hollywood you know It's Montreal This ain't Hollywood It ain't no good at all Friends and fans and faces swoon to meet By the powder room As the limousine drives me to the after hours room To the after hours room
