Listen, I know it's been hard You know it’s no different for me We’re less than a zero-sum game now And baby, we both know that's not how it's supposed to be The writing's on the wall It seems like forever since we had a good day The writing’s on the wall But I… just wanna get you high tonight I… just wanna see some pleasure in your eyes Some pleasure in your eyes I go too high, and you go too cold And we both fall apart Then you bring your mind to rest against mine But the mind has no say in affairs of the heart The writing's on the wall It seems like forever since we had a good day The writing’s on the wallIt could be ten, but then again I can't remember Half an hour since a quarter to four Throw on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa And you leave me with my jaw on the floor Hey!Oh, just when you think you're in control Just when you think you've got a hold Just when you get on a roll Oh, here it goes, here it goes, here it goes again Oh, here it goes again I should've known, should've known, should've known again But here it goes again Oh, oh, here it goes again Starts out easy, something simple, something sleazy Something inching past the edge of reserve Now through the lines of the cheap Venetian blinds Your car is pulling off of the curb Hey!Oh, just when you think you're in control Just when you think you've got a hold Just when you get on a roll Oh, here it goes, here it goes, here it goes again Oh, here it goes again I should've known, should've known, should've known again But here it goes again Oh, here it goes Oh, here it goes Oh, here it goes again Oh, oh, here it goes againYou know you can't keep letting it get you down And you can't keep dragging that dead weight around If there ain't all that much to lug around Better run like hell when you hit the ground When the morning comes When the morning comes You can't stop these kids from dancing — why would you want to 'Specially when you are already getting yours'Cause if your mind don't move and your knees don't bend Well don't go blaming the kids again When the morning comes When the morning comes When the morning comes When the morning comes When the morning comes When the morning comes Let it go, this too shall pass Let it go, this too shall passUpside down and inside out And you can feel it Upside down and inside out And you can feel it, feel it Don't know where your eyes are But they're not doing what you said Don't know where your mind is, baby But you're better off without it Inside down and upside out And you can feel it Don't stop, can't stop It's like an airplane going down I wish I had said the things you thought that I had said Gravity's just a habit that you're really sure you can't break So when you met the new you Were you scared  Were you cold  Were you kind Yeah, when you met the new you Did someone die inside Lot of knots, lot of snags Lot of holes, lot of cracks, lot of crags Lot of nagging old hags Lot of fools, lot of fool scumbags Oh, it's such a drag, what a chore Oh, your wounds are full of salt Everything's a stress, and what's more Well, it's all somebody's fault Get, get, get, get, get over it  Get, get, get, get, get over it  Get, get, get, get, get over it!Get over it, get over it, Oh!Makes you sick, makes you ill Makes you cheat, slipping change from the till Had it up to the gills Makes you cry while the milk still spills Ain't it just a bitch  What a pain Well it's all a crying shame What left to do but complain Better find someone to blameI won't let you down No, I won't let you down I won't let you down, my love I won't let you down No, I won't let you down I won't let you down, my love Now, Nikki, she's got no flag to fly But she don't seem that much to mind No, she don't seem to mind And you, you got your armor on Lights out in Babylon Yeah, lights out in Babylon But maybe all you need is someone to trust Maybe all you need is someone Maybe all you need is someone to trust Maybe all you need is someone And I won't let you down No, I won't let you down I won't let you down, my love I won't let you down No, I won't let you down I won't let you down, my loveI've been waiting for months Waiting for years Waiting for you to change Aw, but there ain't much that's dumber There ain't much that's dumber Than pinning your hopes on a change in another And I, yeah, I still need you But what good's that gonna do Needing is one thing And getting, getting's another So I've been sitting around Wasting my time Wondering what you've been doing Aw, but it ain't real forgiving It ain't real forgiving Sitting here picturing someone else living And I, yeah, I still need you But what good's that gonna do Needing is one thing And getting, getting's anotherYou're right There's nothing more lovely There's nothing more profound Than the certainty Than the certainty That all of this will end That all of this will end So open your arms to me Open your arms to me And this will be The one moment that matters And this will be The one thing we remember And this will be The reason to have been here And this will be The one moment that matters at all So while the mud Reclaims our footprints And while our bones keep looking back At the overgrowth that's swallowing the path There for the grace of God go we There for the grace of God go we There for the grace of time and chance And entropy's cruel hands So open your arms to me Open your arms to meStill of fragile lies and bones Forever, we alone Cannot escape this misery Slow, we step into the light Inebriate in sights Unveil the truth that guides us home Look inside With darkness my tears collide Sinking into the shrine of me I'm ready to be set free I'm sick as a dog in the air I breathe I feel alive My self-portrait suicide Tonight is no time to die And now I'm awake Truth can break your soul in two Just when you think it's you The treachеry will creep inside Embers, sweet and unrefinеd So bright but not so kind Will start a fire in your mindSkyscrapers, please forgive me I didn't mean a word, I said Skyscrapers, I was just tangled up in my own head And somehow, in all the madness I thought that I was seeing straight It ain't always pretty, but it seemed there was no other way And I guess all I ever loved Was standing right before my eyes And I Oh, I, I was blind So skyscrapers, please forgive me I stand here, a penitent man Oh, skyscrapers, I'll never look down again, again Oh, 'cause I guess all I ever loved Was standing right before my eyes Oh, yeah, I guess all I ever loved Was standing, was standing, was standing here all the time And I Yeah I, I was blind I was blind I was blind And you were right here all the time And you were right here all the time And I was blind I was blind I was blind Oh, I was blind
