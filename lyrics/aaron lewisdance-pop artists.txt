Am I the only one, here tonight Shakin' my head and thinkin' somethin' ain't right Is it just me  Am I losin' my mind Am I standin' on the edge of the end of time Am I the only one  Tell me I'm not Who thinks they're takin' all the good we got And turnin' it bad, hell, I'll be damned I think I'm turnin' into my old man Am I the only one, willin' to bleed Or take a bullet for bein' free Screamin', "What the fuck!" at my T VFor tellin' me, yeah, are you tellin' me That I'm the only one, willin' to fight For my love of the red and white And the blue, burnin' on the ground Another statue comin' down in a town near you Watchin' the threads of Old Glory come undone Am I the only one not brainwashed Makin' my way through the land of the lost Who still gives a shit, and worries 'bout his kids As they try to undo all the things he did Now I grew up down an old dirt road, in a town you wouldn't know My pops picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks, back in nineteen sixty-four My grandfather was a drinker, back in the day he'd put 'em down But a war is known to change a man, and the whiskey's known to change a man But, that's not me I rarely drink from the bottle, but I'll smoke a little weed I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go, in a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road And a country boy, is all I'll ever be Now it's been twelve years since I sold my soul, to the devil in L.A He said sign your name here on the dotted line, and your songs they all will play He set up shop on Sunset, he put me up at the Marquee He said, "You wanna sell a million records, boy  You better listen to me"He said, "Change your style, whiten your smile You could lose a couple pounds If you want to live this life, you'd better lose that wife Do you need your friends around "I said, "no that's not me"'Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family And I like my jeans and my old t-shirts, and a couple extra pounds never really hurt'Cause a country boy, is all I'll ever beIf I was a liberal, I'd find a way somehow To make man think he created God, and not the other way around And what you'd see on T V, would seem like the gospel truth And I'd make right look so wrong, I'd make wrong look so cool Hey, anything to keep you on my level If I was a liberal And if I was a liberal, everyone would just see color And I'd take all religions, and I'd turn them against each other I'd sit back and I'd love, and I'd watch you fuel the hate And I'd light fires on the evenin' news and let you fan my flames Hey, anything to keep you out of heaven If I was a liberal And I'd just keep on doin' what I'm doin''Cause what I'm doin' surе is workin' out And if you don't believe mе I could prove it Hey, all you need to do is look around Yeah, I'd be thinkin' things just can't get better If I was a liberal And I'd just keep on doin' what I'm doin''Cause what I'm doin' sure is workin' out And if you don't believe me I could prove it Hey, all you need to do is look around Hell, I'd be thinkin' things just can't get better If I was a liberalI've been shattered and broken, for most of my life But I've done pretty good, with a job and a wife Got a family that loves me, and a good piece of land That I bought with hard work, that I earned with these hands Well these things that I do I did them for you So just tell me you love me, and tell me you'll stay And you'll watch over this house, while I go away And just promise to be here, when I get back home So we can start where we left off, all those years ago Before my demons..  they took control Lost and lonely, out here on the road'Cause I've been careless and selfish, got no self respect I'm an albatross hanging around my own neck I'm a hard one to handle, and I've played the fool And I'm so hard to love, cause I break all the rules Well these things that I do'Cause I couldn't have youWhen I die I'll go to Heaven Because I've spent my time in Hell I've never claimed to know the answers But I've faked it pretty well And I've walked straight through the valley Full of shadows and of death And I've learned a lot of lessons But they haven't killed me yet I lost it all, I tried to make it through my pain I lost it all, and it'll never be the same And right now the only thing that's left, is sadness and the shame I lost it all, and it'll never be the same I lost it all Now I've heard so many stories Full of sadness and regret And I've learned a lot of answers To the things I didn't getWhat a sad state of affairs I'm in'Cause I'm tryin' to compete where I just don't fit in'Cause the country, if you call it that, from off the Row Ain't country just because I'm old enough to know, that That ain't country, that's a natural fact It's full of tales of good times and happy endings, my life ain't like that So I'll keep listenin' to the old songs that my grandad used to play Full of pain and heartache and desperation and the ones that got away The ones that speak to me, the way I feel today So tell me, whatever happened to the country songs Full of truth and consequences, all the things gone wrong Someone came and changed it up, made it all a lie I'd like to spit a little Beech-Nut right in that dude's eye, 'Cause That ain't country, that's a natural fact It's full of tales of good times and happy endings, my life ain't like that So I'll keep listenin' to the old songs that my granddad used to play Full of pain and heartache and desperation and the ones that got awayI lost my faith a long time ago Puttin' miles on this ol’ road I lost my family and I lost my soul800 miles and one more show Still workin' these fingers to the bone When the show is over I sit alone Where the angels and the devils are my only friends I wake up in the morning and I do it again I don't know what you’ve been told All the whiskey in the world won't save my soul I've done it all, so where do I begin To fix all the messes and the state I'm in It's hard Yeah, it's hard I feel like there's a better way To make it through another day So sad that life turned out like this'Cause I still taste you on my lipsMy mama always told me"Son, you'd best go easy down that road."And she said she was sorry For all the times she couldn't save my soul I shoulda listened to her words a little more Before I packed up and I walked right out that door Daddy always told me"Son, you'd better love the best you can."And "Don't look back and be sorry These moments won't be comin' 'round again."But I feel like I could conquer the whole world When I look up and see those three little girls But I get lost, I can't find my way All my pieces glued together for the world to see Mistakes I've made, consumed by some Till there's nothing left of me when all is said and done Now a preacher man once told me"Son, I'm not so sure you can be saved."He said, "Life is full of choices And He sees all the bad ones that you've made."We grow tobacco and we drive trucks We kill whitetails and greenhead ducks And drive our four wheelers down the main road And bust out the sleds when it's cold We got back roads an' four-wheel-drives We got tailgates on a Friday night And it's a half hour from my front door To a Walmart or a grocery store What y'all don't understand It ain't all about a southern man'Cause we got outlaws, we got hicks We got honkytonks out in these sticks We love our whiskey and we love our homegrown God damn it's so good to be home We wear Carhartt, we don't wear suits We wear square toes and Chippewa boots And we all know where we come from And we'll be right here when it's done What y'all don't understand It ain't all about a southern manAm I the only one, here tonight Shakin' my head and thinkin' somethin' ain't right Is it just me  Am I losin' my mind Am I standin' on the edge of the end of time Am I the only one  Tell me I'm not Who thinks they're takin' all the good we got And turnin' it bad, hell, I'll be damned I think I'm turnin' into my old man Am I the only one, willin' to bleed Or take a bullet for bein' free Screamin', "What the fuck!" at my T VFor tellin' me, yeah, are you tellin' me That I'm the only one, willin' to fight For my love of the red and white And the blue, burnin' on the ground Another statue comin' down in a town near you Watchin' the threads of Old Glory come undone Am I the only one not brainwashed Makin' my way through the land of the lost Who still gives a shit, and worries 'bout his kids As they try to undo all the things he did
