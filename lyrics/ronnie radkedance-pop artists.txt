scrap As a matter a fact you better get back Motherfuck clit clat attack Everybody with a Mac sitting in the back of class fucking strapped Amanda Bynes Maybe I’m crazy, amazing in the cranium, praying for haters to actually face me I’m just a stupid boy and I know why Spendin’ all my time on the wifi And I wonder why I do not have a life All I wanted is a bitch to fuck me But all these stupid bitches want to love me But inside I am ugly U-u-u-u-u-u-u-uglyI lost my way again, through the storm, through the wind I'm falling short of what I became in the end Everybody told me not to go, but my whole life I have known That I'm something, that I'm something more Yesterday, my brother died, drivin' to work, damn This shit really hurts, man, I'm feelin' no worth There were so many things I needed to say to you first Now what the fuck am I supposed to do, bro Your kids are really missing you too, though And dad is acting crazy, and I had my first baby And I broke up with my lady, old news Whoa, wait a minute, you mean to tell me You're never coming back, but you need to help me And I can understand why you're sad, my brother And I know you hated mother, but we had each other And I know it seems like it was never enough When the goin' got tough, we would never show love'Cause the love that we needed was high on drugs And I know she didn't mean it, but we're way too young I lost my way again, through the storm, through the wind I'm falling short of what I became in the end Everybody told me not to go, but my whole life I have known That I'm something, that I'm something moreIf I was granted one wish, it would be for you to see me For who I really am because these looks can be deceiving And, I swear to God, if you really listen closely By the time this song is over, you will truly know me'Cause I am not a monster, I am just a man And I'm getting sick and fucking tired of these fans That expect me to be some perfect version of a fucking person And it's hurtful, I feel worthless, I just wanna feel I'm worth it And it's hard, but I am learning, to be honest, and discerning And I'm gaining all my courage to be better, I am searching, damn But it's so damn hard To keep it calm when everything I know is broken and scarred And I'm not trying to complain about my problems at all Because my problems are the reason I have gotten this far So I am thankful for adversity and making me strong I'm just trying to explain how I feel in a song, it goes Oh, I really can't believe that I'm here right now I'm hanging on an airplane, falling through the airwaves in the clouds Oh, I never ever want to touch the ground I'm walking on a tightrope, searching for the right note to play that sound Let's take it back to '92 when I was eight My brother gave me a tape by mistake Dr  Dre, it was December 15th to the date The Chronic on my birthday must've been fate Now let's flash forward to the first time in '99 When I heard Shady on the radio and, to my surprise That this is really happening, a white boy is rapping From the bottom to the top, that motherfucker made it happen So I grabbed my pen and pad and started writing down the madness Later joined a band and wrote my songs around my sadness Formulated all my tragic moments into magic Now I'm selling tickets to my show and have 'em packed in You best believe it 'cause I'm telling the truth I bought a motherfucking Caddy and a house with a view Don't need to prove that I'm amazing and I'm keeping it true So before you try to hate me, try to walk in my shoes, it goesMy Destiny was large From the day I picked up the mic it was written in the stars The day that I was born my father knew and he held  me in his arms Looked into my eyes I sang my first melody, it came out as a cry Thirty years have past and for the very first time I realized I pour my life into every single line I write until I die And I've arrived In a place where I am fine Cause 27 years ago I learned how to survive Why my fucking mother left and dad was always high The powers never on the bill was never on time But I somehow learned to shine Through the darkest nights I found the will to stay alive Now every time you see me you gotta look up to the sky The story of a boy who showed the world that he can fly, but I And it's nice to know that I've made it home But it's safe to say that I'm all alone So here I go, here I am, without you, without them But it's nice to know that I've made it home I made it home, I made it home I'm sorry dad I never meant to hurt you anyway Watching me running from police up on the free way I bet you never thought I'd end up on the news Headline read: "accused murderer on the loose"Dude, that's something I'd never do The skewed view of the news leaving out the fucking truth Of what actually happened God damn it, it was what I had to do Defendin' friend's honor but I refuse to lose So I choose abuse as a muse Interrogation room but I refuse to spew any information too I'm a mute and I will use my right to remain booed I will never talk to red and blue to a jail cell I was due I had to eat their fucking soup Look over my shoulder every time I eat my food Praying for the day that they would let me out soon Cause these boots are made for walking and that's exactly what I'll doSo we say goodbye to the time That we lay our weapons down'Cause it's gotta be over, it's over Let it go And I already know that we'll grow From the memories that we never had'Cause it's over, it's over We both know Yo, my top down, and my bitch high Rocking and rolling; no pit stops Questioned by some bitch cops I'm Helen Keller; Just don't talk Escape the Fate and I are cool No more beef, no more feuds People keep saying I'm lucky But luck isn't half of it Bitch, I'm just stacking my money Since '06, I've been owning Controlling with my nose in these books Reading every little piece of information I took like a cook, and I shook the motion Slap the ground with how hard I'm stomping Troubled motherfuckers while I'm beating towards 'em Seek the heat like a rocket launcher Freaking awesome, walking contradiction My sickness Addiction is the reason I'm spitting It's  my conviction Of the utmost depiction Slash the fiction of the motion and I'm fixing this way of living and a motherfucking engine slashing Stay outta my businessThis is dedicated to all those critics All you social sites All you Wi Fi gangsters Talk shit about this!Fucking Bitch I took a turn for the worse again, for stickin' my neck out for another friend And this is what I get for being too nice, people wonder why I'm a fucking dick What you would do if you had the world Watching every move that you make up for And everywhere that you went, you got a bitch tryna get you to admit it's stitching for attention, damn That's the price of fame I sold my soul into a ball of flame That ball of flame is what keeps me lit, spill my heart in every bar and every line I spit When that camera clicks and they're snapping pics, this is everything that I'm mentioning This is the moment, I'll never let go of it, ready or not I'm about to take over it Paparazzi, snappin' shots Kamikaze, droppin' bombs Family first, millionaire, debt reverse, heir to the chair I reign supreme in every genre, stackin' that cheese, no lasagna King of the jungle, Mufasa Mufasa No worries for me, Hakuna-Matata!Droppin' on the beat without a doubt or referee so need a piece up on a piece up on the mother fuckin' brink You better think before ya blink cause I'm about to fuckin' swing hittin' everything I see in front of me, don't fuck with me I'm killing every verse from the first word to the last verb, I'ma pass church like a bastard pastor Last chapter, Mr  Mathers, wordest rapper, for the sake of crackers to get the last word
