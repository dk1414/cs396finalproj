I know it's near the knuckle but I can tell when I see a real man When it comes to reality, I've only just began You've got a grasp of the real situation I just blunder about in a close approximation You know a lot of people you're always drinking with your friends Arent you You know a lot of people when you've got a lot to spend I'm not a real woman I don't nod my head Or patiently wait for your favours in bed I don't wear lace panties at waste away prices Or bondage and scanties at masochist dances I'm not a real woman I don't waggle my hips Or flap my eyelids or shackle my lips And I'm not a lemon, so please don't squeeze my bits I'm not a real woman, I don't aim to please Twinkle my knickers or garter my knees The nails on my fingers are tattered and torn I've had dirty hands since the day I was born I'm not a real woman I don't nod my head Or patiently wait for your favours in bed And I'm not a lemon so squeeze your own insteadThis is a message to Persons unknown Persons in hiding,

when the 'affair' is over you can always put your pet to 'sleep'An affair of convenience  The convenience of the dominant species Capture  Domesticate  Exterminate Alongside the exploitation of animals for laboratory experimentation, the pet and pet food industry is enormous, feeding off our alienation from each other  Sentimentalizing animals to fit in with our deprivation and need for love, physical contact, and control  So the prettiest and most appealing pets are fed and pampered in return for companionship and obedience  Where have we heard that story before  The Miss World Contests  The pretty docile pets of male sexist fantasy Capture  Domesticate  Exterminate A new girl every year  A new wife every seven year itch  The Nazis who selected the pretty Jewish girls for their Brothels in the concentration camps  They murdered the old and the ugly  Discarded them to use their bodies for soap, lamp- shades and even to feed their guard dogs I was a young girl child in the second world war  All men were soldiers  I couldn't tell from their almost identical khaki uniforms which were 'ours' and which were 'the enemy'  Some of them came home on leave and mingled their tales of fighting on the front with snickering stories about the reputed brothels of Port Said, where the prostitutes were offered side by side with donkeys, who were screwed and abused just like the women were  Extra, extra thrills and treats  I couldn't understand the hot-eyed glances and laughter at these stories  I was frightened  I am still frightened  And of course male military macho ethics Approved of these brothels rather than encourage homosexual contact between The ranks  Military regimes are terrified of love developing between soldiers  Balls Must mean toughness and courage  But the bullet rips through and reveals the Vulnerability of male flesh  Almost as tender as a woman  Almost as vulnerable  They dare not admit that possibility Listen  Butchers are men  The master Race  Manipulators  Tormentors Manufacturers of meat  Think about it  You rape and plunder the entire range of living Creatures  You train the young to follow in Your footsteps by word and by deed  Give Up your knives  Take instead the Vulnerability of your own body  YourYour kids don't get to school on time You don't watch the clock ma The hair don't curl, and their teeth don't shine It's all in doctor spock, ma Your man don't feel too good today You didn't treat him right ma If he don't work he gets no pay You'd better fix him up tonight ma Fix him up tonight, mama, you know how This way that way jump mama jump That way this way jump to it mama higher mama jump You don't knit and you won't sew And you never make the beds ma You don't bake no jammy cakes You just go out instead ma They'll get you mama by your curly hairs They'll have your guts for garters And if you don't get back home tonight They'll have your tits for aftersReaching out my hand I slipped my fingers 'round Our most expensive fruits Of some yellow colour Reaching out my hand I softly stroke the boy's face In memory of darkness Reaching out my hand At the bossman's door I turn the handle Reaching out my hand I touched the money Reaching out my hand I took the money Reaching out my hand I felt the cold zip And the rough cloth of his trousers And the pigskin leather wallet Was fat in my fingers Stuffed with his papers Stuffed with his money Slipped to the floor Fell out from my feet Fell down by my feet It was out of control Out of control Reaching out my hand I saw the handcuffs Reaching out my hand I felt the handcuffs It's alright, ladies, it's only a reality attack It's alright, ladies, you'll get your sanity back Reality attack Reality attack Reality attack Reality attack Reaching down my hand I slipped my fingers 'round A strange, repulsive fruit Of some rare, blue colour Reaching down my hand The baby spun from my grasp And lept into the night skyDesperate days  Nothing on the airways People just standing around Talking on corners Waiting for the end to come Jezebel for a hand to hold Everywhere's the same, no-ones to blame The escalator Everyone's running up and down At the same time Who could have guessed the end of the line Would look like this Jezebel signs of praise She never sang beforeTheir bite is as lethal As a Hollywood dream The slave owner's daughters Are not what they seem The girls over there Have stolen my words Their mouths are as cheap As dead baby birds Their voices are empty Though frequently heard The girls over there Have stolen my words The dollar dollies jiveDoes it fuck you up Jenny Do they fuck you up Jenny Are you fucked up Jenny Do they fuck you up much Jenny Can you call your soul And your body your own Have you got a shelter And is it a home Jenny Are you wrapped up Daddy Have they wrapped you up Daddy Are you tied up Daddy Have they tied you up Daddy Can you call your timeI fell through mirrors I fell through mirrors and glass Ran wild round a corner I jumped off a train Running down the subway steps In the pouring rain Ran away one bad time, I jumped off a bus You'll never see my face again What became of us What became of us â€“ What became of us Crazy in a southern town One summer and a day I ran wild one more time
