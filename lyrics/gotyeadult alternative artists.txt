Now and then, I think of when we were together Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die I told myself that you were right for me But felt so lonely in your company But that was love and it's an ache I still remember You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness Like resignation to the end, always the end So when we found that we could not make sense Well, you said that we would still be friends But I'll admit that I was glad it was over But you didn't have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough No, you didn't have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records and then change your number I guess that I don't need that, though Now, you're just somebody that I used to know Now, you're just somebody that I used to know Now, you're just somebody that I used to knowPick apart the pieces of your heart And let me peer inside Let me in where only your thoughts have been Let me occupy your mind as you do mine You have lost too much love To fear, doubt and distrust, it's not enough You just threw away the key to your heart Don't get burned 'cause nothing gets through It makes it easier, easier on you That much more difficult for me To make you see Love ain't fair So there you are, my love Your heart's a mess You won't admit to it It makes no sense, but I'm desperate to connect And you, you can't live like thisWith our eyes wide open, we—With our eyes wide open, we—So this is the end of the story Everything we had, everything we did Is buried in dust, and this dust is all that's left of us But only a few ever worried While the signs were clear, they had no idea You just get use to livin' in fear Or give up, when you can't even picture your future We walk the plank with our eyes wide open We walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we—Yeah, we walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we—Some people offered up answers We made out we like we heard they were only words They didn't add up, to a change in the way we were living And the saddest thing, is all of it could've been avoided But it was like to stop consuming, is to stop being human And why'd I make a change if you won't We're all in the same, boat, stayin' afloat for the momentWhen the Cotillion arrived We threw out the television Model D-575 has custom flute presets And Harmony-Plus in addition Now for an arm and a leg We get three half-dozen beats to choose from So now we can pretend There's an orchestra in the lounge room I put the Genie Bass on So my left hand can play the choir With 16ft Diapason And Lowrey's patented Orchestral Symphonizer Banjo's great on repeat The kids want to play, but they'll have to be patient The wife can't help tapping her feet It's a genuine home entertainment revelation State, state, state, state of the art State, state, state, state of the art State, state, state, state of the art State, state, state, state of the artNow your bowl is empty And your feet are cold And your body cannot stop rocking, I know It hurts to let go Since the day we found you You have been our friend And your voice still echoes in the hallways of this house But now, it's the endYou're a fraud and you know it But it's too good to throw it all away Anyone would do the same You've got 'em going And you're careful not to show it Sometimes you even fool yourself a bit It's like magic But it's always been a smoke and mirrors game Anyone would do the same So now that you've arrived, well you wonder What is it that you've done to make the grade And should you do the same Are you only trying to please them Will they see then You're desperate to deliver Anything that could give you A sense of reassurance When you look in the mirror Such highs and lows You put on quite a show All these highs and lows And you're never really sure what you do it for And do you even want to know You put on quite a showWriting a song thought I would never make Called you names thought I would never say You were my angel, for Heaven's sakes Now, we ended a bond that we thought we would never break Real love: I meant it, but that real love starts with a friendship And I'm sorry for the things that I mentioned But in love and war, we seek vengeance Tell me where did we go wrong: I guess we was never that right I heard you trying to be a actress, but you ain't even got your act right You said that maybe we should slow down, but I was caught up in the fast life I'm just saying...But you didn't have to cut me off;Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough No, you didn't have to stoop so low:Have your friends collect your records, and then change your number I guess that I don't need that though Now, you're just somebody that I used to know Now, you're just somebody that I used to know Now, you're just somebody that I used to knowSeventeen seconds then I'm over it Ready for the disconnect Putting on a brave face, trying not to listen To the voices in the back of my head But it's alright now Alright now Some feelings have a habit of persisting Even though you wouldn't let it show Wearing me out Hanging around Getting me down Looking for an easy way out Brain-dead from boredom, I'm led to distractions Scratching the surface of life Nothing really happens, but it's easy to keep busy When you tell yourself you're traveling right But it's alright now Alright now Keep on second guessing Use my memory like a weapon on everything I tryEhyea, eyo Ehyea, eyo Ehyea, eyo Ehyea, eyo Ehyea, eyo Ehyea, eyo Ehyea, eyo Ehyea, eyo In the mornings, I was anxious It was better just to stay in bed Didn't want to fail myself again Running through all the options and the endings Were rolling out in front of me But I couldn't choose a thread to begin And I could not love'Cause I could not love myself Never good enough, no That was all I'd tell myself And I was not well But I could not help myself I was giving up on living Now and then, I think of when we were together Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die I told myself that you were right for me But felt so lonely in your company But that was love and it's an ache I still remember You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness Like resignation to the end, always the end So when we found that we could not make sense Well, you said that we would still be friends But I'll admit that I was glad it was over But you didn't have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough No, you didn't have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records and then change your number I guess that I don't need that, though Now, you're just somebody that I used to know Now, you're just somebody that I used to know Now, you're just somebody that I used to know
