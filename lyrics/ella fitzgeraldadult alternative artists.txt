am I Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I Lost my heart, but what of it He is cold, I agree He can laugh, but I love it Although the laugh's on me I'll sing to him, each spring to him And long for the day when I'll cling to him Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I He's a fool and don't I know it But a fool can have his charms I'm in love and don't I show it Like a babe in arms Love's the same old sad sensation Lately I've not slept a wink Since this half-pint imitation Put me on the blinkGrab your coat, and get your hat Leave your worry on the doorstep Just direct your feet To the sunny side of the street Can't you hear a pitter-pat And that happy tune is your step Life can be so sweet On the sunny side of the street I used to walk in the shade With the blues on parade But I'm not afraid This Rover crossed over If I never have a cent I'll be rich as Rockefeller Gold dust at my feet On the sunny side of the street I used to walk in the shade With those blues on parade But I'm not afraid This Rover has crossed overLove is like a never-ending melody Always have compared it to a symphony A symphony conducted by the lighting of the moon But our song of love is slightly out of tune Once your kisses raised me to a fever pitch Now the orchestration doesn't seem so rich Seems to me you've changed the tune we used to sing Like the bossa nova, love should swing We used to harmonize, two souls in perfect time Now the lyrics and the melody don't even rhyme For you forgot the melody our hearts would always croon And so what good's a heart that's slightly out of tune Tune your heart to mine the way it used to be Join with me in harmony and sing a song of loving We've got to be together and before too long There'll be no desafinado When you give your heart  to me completely Then you won't be slightly out of tune You'll sing along with me There'll be no desafinado When you give your heart  to me completely You won't be slightly out of tune You'll sing along with meMy heart is sad and lonely!For you I sigh, for you dear only Why haven't you seen it I'm all for you, Body and Soul I spend my days in longing And wondering why it's me you're wronging I tell you, I mean it I'm all for you, Body and Soul!I can't believe it Its hard to conceive it That you'd turn away romance Are you pretending It looks like the ending!--Unless, I can have One more chance to prove dear..My life a wreck you're making!You know I'm yours For just the taking I'd gladly surrender Myself to you, Body and Soul All of me, why not take all of me Baby, can't you see, I'm no good without you Take my lips, I'll never use them Take my arms, I want to lose them Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry Tell me how can I go on, dear, without you You took the part that once was my heart So why not take all of me All of me, why not take all of me Can't you see I'm no good without you Take my lips, I want to lose 'em Take my arms, I'll never use them Your g-g-goodbye left me with eyes that cry How can I go on, dear, without you You took the part that once was my heart So why not take all of me Come on and take, take all of meWhen the bells all ring and the horns all blow And the couples we know are fondly kissing Will I be with you or will I be among the missing Maybe it's much too early in the game Ah, but I thought I'd ask you just the same What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight When it's exactly twelve o'clock that night Welcoming in the New Year, New Year's Eve Maybe I'm crazy to suppose I'd ever be the one you chose Out of the thousand invitations you received Ah, but in case I stand one little chance Here comes the jackpot question in advance What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve Oh, what are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve
