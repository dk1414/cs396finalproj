here"As it turned out, I wouldn't be going anywhere She had me handcuffed to the bedpost"I think you're making a big mistake I swear, it's not what it looks like We're just friends Oh please, I'm sorry sir"Your half-naked body exited the bedroom And lingered on down the hallway where he was there waiting He said, "Girl, what happened to your face Why is it all red "Then he clinched his fist and walked on down the hallway To the bedroom where I was sleeping The veins burst out of his neck as he said"Boy, I'll give you two minutes to get out of my house or you are a dead man"Where the fuck is my camera Have you seen my camera Oh God, where is my camera I think it's there by the barbed wireYour head, well it's talking to you Conversations, they're not making any sense Repetitious
