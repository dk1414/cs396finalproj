To part time lovers Now you're moving in the first date of september I can remmember when i saw you back in december It was so cold outside You was breakin up And so was i and Neither one of us wanted to give love a try But we would talk, talk, laugh and have a ball But then we got drunk and fooled around and had a booty call A booty call Ain't nuthin wrong with a bootycall Everybody like a bootycall Now and then Sing I can tell that were gonna be freinds I can tell that were gonna be freindsThis town's so hype it's got soul As a Philly cat I'm with the roll And the swing of my things How they work like clockwork Tick tock tick tock Times always lurking in your head Got to go to work and get fed That man didn't eat but he goes to sleep Gets up at dawn not to see the sunrise But because it's too damn cold outside Underneath the bridge they pump the city's bilge Into the alley sweep the city's filth Flowers wilt, the flowers wilt Don't tell me 'bout no game Cause that is a man And his family The revolution family Look at the family Yeah, dig the family They're living the wrong way Can't get nothing Don't got nothing all they wanted was Something like a job But it's been robbed Yeah and there's so many street side Beggars and disabled veterans Glass-eyed and peddling Drunk and just meddling You conclude it's their fault They like the street they must like the asphalt That is man, woman, and children The system has stalled shelter's home That's not what I call it I call it bad health Some say help themselves Yo if you gots it, dig Every hundred people, that's a dollars 'n change Every hundred people, that's a dollars 'n changeWhy let this world just wait on your shoulders Pick it up, push it off, before you let yourself get colder Just look into the eyes, the good eyes of a child And see that love rise like a river and float for a thousand miles Gimme some Peace, love, happiness Peace, love, happiness Alright now Come on get to me Breathin' deep, feel your heart beat Just to know that life's worth living Feel your feet on the earth You better love it while it's still here spinning I got no time to worry About troubles on been givin'You gotta let it flow, let yourself go'Cause if you're hatin, you sure ain't livin'Gimme some Peace, love, happiness Peace, love, happiness Come on give it to meWho's got the weed I got the weed Who's got the weed I got the weed Mamma always used to say, "Hey G, baby Don't smoke the reefer, it will make you lazy"I really should have listened'Cause she might have saved me But I was too young and I was too, too crazy But I got so much love for my mother But still I praised the jay then I pass to it to a brother'Cause a friend for me is a friend indeed And I've got plenty of friends that smoked a lotta weed No seeds, I roll up like a cone, like a tornado Pass around sucker, we're fast like a hot potato And then I feel my fingers grip, reality start to slip Exact same of a huge hit Of the kind of vapors
