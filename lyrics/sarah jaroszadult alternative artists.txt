Build me up from bones Wrap me up in skin Hold me close Enough to breathe me in The moon's a fingernail Scratching on the back Of the night In which we lay beside I held every inch of you I wrote every line for you I made time when time was all but gone You're the love I've always known The night's so dark and grey But you've helped me find my way Through the wilds And wonders of this world So take me with you now'Cuz I need to show you how I can love you Better than beforeDo you think of me the way I think of you Do you hope for things most likely won't come true Do you dream of me like I dream of you Tell me darling, please tell me true Tell me darling, please tell me true Do you hum a little tune all day long Do you hear my name in the chorus of your song When you sing your song, does it make you feel brand new Tell me darling, please tell me true Tell me darling, please tell me true Do you wonder why we live and why we die Do you wonder why we laugh and why we cry Do you wonder why we dance, and why we fall Tell me darling, do you wonder these at all Tell me darling, do you wonder these at all Like a child who can't wait to go and play I am waiting for love to come my way Can we make this new love fit like an old shoe Tell me darling, please tell me true Tell me darling, please tell me trueIn the middle of the night again Still water and the birds don't sing Cold gin in the back room humming Medicating for the trouble that's coming Walls rattle like a diesel freighter Blood races like a wave This house wasn't meant for strangers But you come knocking anyway I can hear you knocking on the door I won't leave it open for you anymore I can hear you knocking on the door Knocking on the door of the house of mercy Don't try to change my mind That knock gets louder all the time Don't try to wear me down You'll never get inside this house Underneath that shirt you're wearing Strained muscles and a heart of stone Double-crossing like a wild chameleon You make me want to be aloneMany a year ago In a kingdom by the sea There lived a maiden you may know By the name of Annabelle Lee No other thought did trouble her mind But to love and be loved by me We were children both In this kingdom by the sea But we loved with a love that was more than love I and my Annabelle Lee With a love that the winged angels high Coveted her and me This was the reason long ago In this kingdom by the sea A wind blew from a stormy cloud That took my Annabelle Lee Then her wicked brothers came To steal her away from me They shut her up in a tomb below This kingdom by the sea But no maiden's grave could sever my soul From the love she bore for me For the moon don't beam without a dream Of my darling Annabelle LeeYou are going down a dark road And you find yourself alone And you are seeing things you never saw before But the loneliness will leave you And you find yourself at home And suddenly the world is knocking at your door And the darkness covers you sometimes And the road is long but it always unwinds And I find if you take your time You will make it fine The way I feel inside is not a mirror of my mind But I cannot find a way To be what I should be With a thousand miles between us I can feel you in my arms But it's just a feeling deep in my memorySet me free and watch me fall Lose the feeling of it all I wish the night would let me in Back here knocking on the door again If I ever wake up At the right time If I ever wake up I’ll find a way to change your mind I dreamed we fell into the night Your darkness shined the brightest light We drove for miles on the moon I’d go anywhere with you If I ever wake up At the right time If I ever wake up I’ll find a way to change your mindI wanna step right out and tell you But I know it's not allowed Truth is you're all that I can see In the middle of this crowd I wanna tell you that I'm thankful For your fingers on those strings Wanna whisper low into your ear All these forbidden things But I'll stand right here and hold my tongue For all I know I'm the only one But do you feel this undercurent And the changing of the tides When I'm with you, baby We've got everything to hide When I'm running out of time Is when I wanna do it all When you're running through my mind Is when I wanna hear you call Well, you're always running through my mind So why don't you call now It ain't right but it feels good Let's do this anyhowTake me back in time again Stay with me like you did then Take me as you find me here Take me now, feel me near Love like I never knew before Someday will fade and be ignored Nothing is forever anymore Wrap me up in quiet sins Take me lost, make me found Hold me silent in the night Say, "I'm wrong, make me right"Love like I never knew before Someday will fade and be ignored Slippin' through my fingers, wantin' more Hanging on to every word Whispered as the morning stirsAway, away and find your true love He's gone away to find a new love But he don't know that he runs in vain And you my dear will find love again She cried "Come home, my darling, true love And you may find what my heart's made of You left me here, alone on my own But through the tears I know you'll come home"Around, around this whole world we've been The hills soon find he's my home again At last, at last he's back by her side This story tells that true love can't hideJacqueline, I see you there, in your Pillbox hat and your bright pink dress Won't you sit and keep me company Walk with me to the water's edge It ain't that far from where the sidewalk ends Won't you keep me company And we'll move on down To the water's edge Move on down Stick my feet in Feel it cool me down Who do I talk to now Jacqueline I cried my tears, and they Fell on down into Your dark and misty blue I'm standin' right here next to you Then you shed your bright pink dress You covered up with a blanket of white Jackie, won't you walk with me tonight
