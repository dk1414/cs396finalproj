Dare me to jump off of this Jersey bridge I bet you never had a Friday night like this Keep it up, keep it up, let's raise our hands I take a look up at the sky and I see red Red for the cancer, red for the wealthy Red for the drink that's mixed with suicide Everything red Please, won't you push me for the last time Let's scream until there's nothing left So sick of playing, I don't want this anymore The thought of you's no fucking fun You want a martyr  I'll be one Because enough's enough, we're done You told me, "Think about it," well, I did Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore I'm tired of begging for the things that I want I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor Yeah Let's go!I kissed the scars on her skin I still think you're beautiful And I don't ever want to lose my best friend I screamed out, "God, you vulture Bring her back or take me with her"Tear it down, break the barricade!I want to see what sound it makes I hate this flavor with a passion And I fucking hate the aftertaste!How does it feel  How does it feel Well, it feels like I'm on fire Wake up, I know you can hear me Make me a promise here tonight, love like a tidal wave Dreamless in early graves, I never want it to be this way The chemicals will bring you home again This is it, when it's done, we can say that When it's sudden death, we fight back Pretend like I don't entice you I've seen you circling the sky above my head You traitor  I will never be taken for granted again Say a prayer for you, I know that you're in pain But if we die at the same time, does it still scare you Sunshine There ain't a thing that you can do that's gonna ruin my night This dizzy dreamer and her bleeding little blue boy Licking your fingers like you're done and You've decided there is so much more than me And baby honestly it's harder breathing next to you, I shake I brought a gun and as the preacher tried to stop me Hold my heart it's beating for you anyway What if I can't forget you  I'll burn your name into my throat I'll be the fire that'll catch you What's so good about picking up the pieces None of the colors ever light up anymore in this hole Oh Nobody prays for the heartless Nobody gives another penny for the selfish Don't mind me, I'm just reaching for your necklace Talking to my mom about this little girl from TexasDo you know I count your heartbeats before you sleep I bite my fingernails to bone And now I crawl back under the stairwell To a place I call my home I really hope you enjoy the show Because for me, it's just a bad day You need people like me to feel Maybe we're just having too much fun Maybe you can't handle yourself Staring at me with your lips and tongue You'll never know I don't know where I'm going to sleep tonight She said hotels are cheap and there's one down the street But, oh, don't you threaten me with a good time Murder the moment, my God, I'm the serpent I'm sorry, I can't see that you truly loved me Maybe we're just having too much fun Maybe you can't handle yourself Staring at me with your lips and tongue I've been having this dream that we can fly So maybe if we never wake up, we can see the skyRage in us, your thirst I'm taking Pull the plug, I'll keep on shaking And thrustin' about your apartment Drowned on the blankets, floral and fading, huh Painful lust, two aching guts They tear through each other in the mirror This happy vacation, there's no motivation To hold me up You say you want to chase the moon like fire Well, together we can fake our own deaths here Just wanna be alone and watch as you all just disappear D-d-d-darker now, kicked out and sleeping in your car You roll the window down Enough to dream and make-believe Our lights knocked out, turned upside down And I'm just a stupid motherfucker, can't figure it out I want devil horns, I wanna breathe in your rush I wanna leap when you want me to fly But darling, I don't mean to beg But these thorns on the stem are nearly tearing up my skinShe sits up high, surrounded by the sun One million branches and she loves everyone"Mom and dad, did you search for me I've been up here so long I'm going crazy"And as the sun went down We ended up on the ground I heard the train shake the windows You screamed over the sound And as we own this night I put your body to the test with mine This love was out of control3, 2, 1 - Where did it go "Now don't be crazy, yes, now, of course, you can stay here"Been in a touring band for going on ten years"Big deal", she said, "I guess you're official."I only said it because I know what it's like to feel burned out!It gets you down, we've all been there sometimes But tonight, I'll make you feel beautiful once again And as the sun went down We ended up on the ground I heard the train shake the windows You screamed over the sound And as we own this night I put your body to the test with mine This love was out of control3, 2, 1 - Where did it go I'll breathe you in with smoke in the backyard light We used to laugh until we choked, into the wasted nights It was the best time of my life, but now I sleep alone So don't, don't, don't wake me up, cause my thrill is gone Say I'm wrong in the sunset turning red behind the smoke Forever and alone Yeah And you've gone and sewn me to this bed The taste of you and me will never leave my lips again Under the blinding rain I wanna hold your hand so tight, I'm gonna break my wrists And when the vultures sing tonight, I'm gonna join right in I'll sing along, Because I don't know any other song I'll sing along, but I'm barely hanging on No, I'm barely hanging on By the time you're hearing this I'll already be gone And now there's nothing to do but scream at the drunken moon This isn't fair, no, don't you try to blame this on me My love for you was bulletproof, but you're the one who shot me And goddammit, I can barely say your name So, I'll try to write it and fill the pen with blood from the sink Woah  Oh But, don't just say it, you should sing my name Pretend that it's a song because forever, it's yours And we can sing this on the way homeCannot spend another night in this home I close my eyes and take a breath real slow The consequence is if I leave, I'm alone But what's the difference when you beg for love 'Cause I run through glass in the street Kerosene hearts carry the name that my father gave me And take the face of the wolf'Cause this is a wasteland, my only retreat With heaven above you, there's hell over me I met a girl who never looked so alone Like sugar water in your mouth lukewarm She tied a cherry stem for me with her tongue We fell in love and now we're both alone'Cause I don't need any more friends And another kiss like a fire on pavement We'll burn it down to the end Oh, oh This is a wasteland, my only retreat With heaven above you, there's hell over me The water is rusted, the air is unclean And there for a second, I feel free This is a wasteland, my only retreatBaby, pour over Tell me, are we concrete What would you do without my perfect company to your undressed spine And I can hear you drag behind my car by your broken legs Swallowing stitches in her sleep As she stole my only view, may I never blink While you stood over the pavement I was biting the curb Sick entertainment But I'll bet it feels good coming down Can't bear to wash out the wasted time Between your lips and mine Zero friends Followed your voices into a sea of crosses She blends in with the foxes gold and feels like home Under the surface, my love But beware, beware, beware And take it slow tonight We're on the other side of the road I think we're bleeding outDive in, take a breath Blow the smoke through the hole in my chest Still choking on the bed Found your waste while the ember red keeps falling down and burning holes Until the pillow and the mattress glow Now I wanna be the tattoo ink that swims down through the needle in your skin And I wish I was poisonous Like a bottomless sound, like a violent drug Do you remember the knife I kept The sharper it got, the more you wanted me to use it I was lying to you, but you were lying too So what's left to do What's left to say Stop making friends, just us I'll decompose with you So light the fuse inside your brain and we-We will detonate You threw your drink at the wall It started raining wine and glass so Stay and warm me with the Gentlemen Jack Gold locks on the cage Turn your diamond keys Open the door you'll see me digging out my getaway Hang the stars Who pulled the pin out of my heart
