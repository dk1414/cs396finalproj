One last time from Freddie's Joint We drove out to Lover's Point Shared our last kiss eye to eye Spoke of tender times long past Said they weren't meant to last Too many different needs to satisfy She wants new shoulders to cry on New back seat to lie on And she always gets her way She wants to see other guys Get lost in other eyes Baby's in the black books Yes, she's in the black books today I've yet to find a dreary bar Where whispers don't drift from afar About her wild and wicked ways The hardest truths don't have a why Often true love will just die And leave a grief to haunt the lonely nights and days She wants new shoulders to cry on New back seat to lie on And she always gets her way She wants to hurt other guys Put tears in other eyes Baby's in the black books Yes, she's in the black books todayThis is a right-away letter I've got to mail it today Straight to my main inspirer Says urgent from the U SA It's got this heart inside it The postage is my soul Contains a message from millions Says Keith don't go10000 guitars wailin'But it ain't quite the same You've got a knack for sailin'And it's stamped with your own brand name We's all sailors, as captain you must know You bring a message to millions Says Keith don't go I said Keith don't go Don't take my fun Keith don't go Keith don't go We miss our father Jimi It's hard to breathe with that loss But I still got you brother Don't nail yourself to a cross I watch you lead the pack You put the drive into my soul You bring a message to millions Says Keith don't go I said Keith don't go Don't take my fun Keith don't go Keith don't goJust another room Just another town Same old crazy people hanging around Still you shine silently Different interstates Comin' down alone Feel like packin' all my bags And running home Shine silently Shine silently I don't need no light in the darkness Shine silently No I won't get lost while your loves shines Shines on me People at the door People on the phone Same old story No time on my own Still shine silently Nothing left to say Nothing left to prove When it's said and done There's nothing left but you, baby Shine silentlyJust two lonely kids in school Right before geometry My friend Jimmy lost his cool And he pulled a gun on me Him and Wanda used to date But that was over months ago Though she has been seen with me of late We're just a couple friends moving slow Now all of this I try to explain But Jimmy shook with way too much pain Then he shot himself instead No one knows yet if he's dead I wanna talk to the man in the moon Maybe he has an extra room This place is hell, wanna cut out soon I wanna live with the man in the moon I've seen this kinda thing on T VBut all of them were fat and 43 Hey I'm only 14 years old What kind of world am I living in If I could live with the man in the moon Just be a kid from July til' JuneWell, my manager kept tellin' me If I wanna be great I'd better wise up And play my songs straight I said, "Hey fool In order to survive I gotta be my dirty self I won't play no jive!"He told me he'd quit I said, "Don't jump to conclusions!Maybe bein' staight ain't the right solution I'm not Bob Dylan But I never miss a beat I ain't no philosopher I dance in the street"Well, I came to dance Yes, I came to dance It's a rhythm romance I'm havin' with my shoes I've got nothin' to loseEveryday I get complaints from you Starts me thinking baby I'm your fool Broken dreams all on the floor You can't back it up anymore'Cause I found out love just ain't enough I need devotion to back it up I found out, love just ain't enough I need devotion to back it up Right back to the top You made the moment till the pain has stopped Roll it over twice Don't give up there might be something nice I said don't give up Hold on now, it's a shame I say You've been cheating on me, friends say Let them all look and laugh at me'Cause I'm so far even you can't see I found out love just ain't enough I need devotion to back it up I found out love just ain't enough I need devotion to back it up Out for the first - the atmosphere is heavy World title lays on the line Strong and proud he is much older I am the faster I'm in my prime Third round late he starts to tire Open cut over his left eye Smelling blood attack is relentless In the back seats I see his girl cry Cry - no mercy, no quarter No place to hide for me and the man Lefts and rights never came in harder No mercy, take it while you can - now!No mercy take it while you can Back in my corner they scream "No mercy !""Put him away, don't let him recover!"Someone's eyes drills holes in my head It is his proud determined mother Cry - no mercy, no quarter No place to hide for me or the man Right and wrong never came in harder No mercy, take it while you can - now!No mercy, take it while you canAh, you, wake me with the gentlest touch When you, kiss me, oh, I feel I must I have you;You have everything I need Except a burning love for me When I first saw you that day I had to ask you stay We ate and drank to much And our hearts softly touched Now, in us I do believe Or have I been deceived Ah, you; you come down like early rain, and you Wash away my every pain, and you You have everything I need Except a burning love for me Well we had this for a while And when we make love, you'd always smile Still, there's a distance I can't close I'm in deeper, and it shows  It shows Well, while our hearts are young and there's still time Tell me what to do to make you mine Oh, mine, ah, you You walk outside and birds start to sing, ah, you You look at me and know everything I feel I feel, grant me one wish, and I'll be free I want you more in love with me I want you more in love with me, ah, youHow come the sun still warms my feet Wicked fear inside I can’t erase Brothers and sisters keep get’n shot down And me left standing in this flirty town Why am I running crazed and free No answers come Why me Spent too much time on daddy’s knee Left me too tender to love n trust Raging haunted feelin’s guaranteed I’m branded with a reckless wanderlust My soul litters in enchanted ways No answers come, Why me Why me Is there hope in my catastrophe Why me Why me Could be love in my catastrophe Why me Cast out cry respect, as I walk Humble up and breath, walk the talk When one door shuts another opens wide Hell in the hallway kills or heals your eyeRun this race, it will make you cry Big tears black as coal You fight so hard for some dignity In a world out of control I have seen hope whither beyond despair I've seen great man's visions fail Yet everyday somewhere the sun does shine So don't tell me it's too late To believe a little bit in yourself Is it clear I just want to help Both your blue eyes and the tears They won't get you far You must believe a little bit in yourself Would you believe a little bit in yourself Is it clear I just want to help Both your blue eyes and the tears They won't get you far You must believe a little bit in yourself
