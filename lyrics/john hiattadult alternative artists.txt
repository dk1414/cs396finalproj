When the road gets dark And you can no longer see Just let my love throw a spark And have a little faith in me And when the tears you cry Are all you can believe Just give these loving arms a try, baby And have a little faith in me And have a little faith in me And have a little faith in me And have a little faith in me And have a little faith in me When your secret heart Cannot speak so easily Come here darlin', from a whisper start To have a little faith in me And when your back's against the wall Just turn around and you, you will see I will catch you, I will catch your fall baby Just have a little faith in meWhen I was a boy I thought it just came to ya'But I never could tell what's mine So it didn't matter anyway My only pride and joy Was this'a racket down here Bangin' on an old guitar And singin' what I had to say I always thought our house was haunted'Cause nobody said boo to me I never did get what I wanted Now I get what I need It's been a slow turnin'From the inside out A slow turnin', baby But you come about A slow learnin'But you learn to sway A slow turnin', baby Not fade away, not fade away, not fade away Now I'm in my car I got the radio down An' I'm a'yellin' at the kids in the back'Cause they're bangin' like'a Charlie WattsMy baby's gone and I don't know why She let out this morning Like a rusty shot in a hollow sky Left me without warning Sooner than the dogs could bark And faster than the sun rose Down to the banks in an old mule car She took a flatboat across the shallow Left me in my tears to drown She left a baby daughter Now the water's wide and deep and brown She's crossing muddy waters Tobacco standing in the fields Be rotten come November And a bitter heart will not reveal A spring that love remembers When that sweet brown girl of mine Her black eyes are ravens We broke the bread and drank the wine From a jug that she'd been saving Left me in my tears to drown She left a baby daughter Now the water's wide and deep and brown She's crossing muddy watersA moment of steel A dry-eyed house Did he say goodbye to you Or did you kick him out I know you're not afraid To go alone But this was a marriage of spirit, flesh, and bone Now whatcha gonna do When the planets shift Whatcha gonna do Gonna slit your wrist And bleed all over the Milky Way The stars in your eyes look red today Cry love Cry love The tears of an angel The tears of a dove Spillin' all over Your heart from above Cry love Cry love The trust of a woman In his hand But he was a little boy Not a man You loved him stronger Than he could feel Yeah he was wrapped up in himself like an orange peelDown here the river, meets the sea And in the sticky heat I feel ya' open up to me Love comes outta' nowhere baby, just like a hurricane And it feels like rain And it feels like rain Lyin' underneath the stars right next to you And I'm wonderin' who you are and How do you do How do you do, baby The clouds roll in across the moon Wind howls out your name And it feels like rain And it feels like rain We ain't never gonna' make that bridge tonight, baby Across the Ponchartrain And it feels like rain And it feels like rain So batten down the hatches, baby And leave your heart out on your sleeve It looks like we're in for stormy weather That ain't no cause for us to leave Just lie here, in my arms And let it wash away the pain It feels like rain And it feels like rainClose one there Choking in clean underwear Bleeding tongue Eight ball pounding in my lungs Ship to shore I can't see the coastline anymore I shouldn't be here I thought I made that loud and clear But the master of disaster Gets tangled in his telecaster He can't play it any faster When he plays the blues When he had the heart to ask her And every note just shook the plaster Now he's just a mean old bastard When he plays the blues China town Chasing that old dragon down Madam Wong's We play the blues with the curtains drawn Sidewalks of white While the la sun beat out the night Pounding brain My last transmission down the drainI woke up in a hotel, didn't know what to do I turned the T V on, wrote a letter to you The news was talkin' 'bout a dead man up on the interstate Seems they were lookin' for a Cadillac with Tennessee plates Well since I left California, baby, things have gotten worse Seems the land of opportunity for me it's just a curse Tell that judge in Bakersfield my trial'll have to wait Down here they're lookin' for a Cadillac with Tennessee plates It was somewhere in Nevada, it was cold outside She was shiverin' in the dark, so I offered her a ride Three bank jobs later, four cars hot-wired We crossed the Mississippi like an oil slick fire Now if they'd known what we was up to they wouldn'ta let us in And now we landed in Memphis like original sin Elvis Presley Boulevard to the Graceland gates See we were lookin' for a Cadillac with Tennessee plates Well, there must have been a dozen of them parked in that garage There wasn't one a'Lincoln and there wasn't one Dodge There wasn't one Japanese model or make Just pretty, pretty Cadillacs with Tennessee plates She saw him singing once when she was seventeen And ever since that day she's been livin' in between I was never king of nothin' but this wild weekend Anyway he wouldn't care, hell, he gave 'em to his friendsI dreamed I did a good job and I got well paid Blew it all at the penny arcade A hundred dollars on a kewpie doll I guess no white chick is gonna make me crawl That's right On a T WA, to the promised land Every woman, child and man Gets a Cadillac and a diamond ring Don't you know we're riding with the king He's on a mission of mercy to the new frontier He's gonna check us all on out of here Up to that mansion on a hill Where you can get your prescription filled Any kind of pill On a T WA to the promised land Everybody come on and clap your hands Don't you just love the way he sings Don't you know we're riding with the king She came onto him like a slow movin' cold front An' his beer was warmer than the look in her eye She sat on a stool, and he said, "What do you want "And she said, "Give me a love that don't freeze up inside"He said, "I have melted some hearts in my time dear But to sit next to you, well, I shiver and shake And if I knew love, well, I don't think I'd be here Askin' myself if I've got what it takes"To melt your icy blue heart Should I start To turn what's been frozen for years Into a river of tears These days we all play cool, calm and collected Why, our lips could turn blue just shootin' the breeze But under the frost, well, he thought he detected A warm blush of red and a touch of her knee He said, "Girl, you're a beauty like I've never witnessed An' I've seen the Northern Lights dancin' on air An' I felt the cold follow the first kiss There's not enough heat in the fires burnin' there"When your heart touches mine And my thoughts explode When our wires get crossed And the fire burns my soul Then I know you're home When you shine your light And i dont have to use the phone To call you Baby when you hold me tight We can count heartbeats and squeeze Baby when you hold me tight You can really make a man say, please When im down to my last Cigarette in your bed And the smoke rings blow THrough the dreams in your head And we burn through the dark With a light so bright And the hardest part is leavin'Baby when you hold me tight We can count heartbeats and squeeze Baby when you hold me tight You can really make a man say please
