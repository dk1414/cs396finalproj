A complicated sunset Sets the mood within the room All bets are up and We keep looking down To try and find The will to turn this around I spent the last three months In mental traction Woeing all I could forsee I slept myself free and Cursed at all awake The medicine I'd take I broke down On the train to southtown Midway inbound Eleven to your seven I held out Carrying this crutch around Angry words came rushing out Eleven to your seven Now I could pound on the keys so hard and Make the mallets slap the strings and Pump the pedals till I'm breathless and Sing off key and Wouldn't that be just like me Quit If you're through with it You are gonna make me sick Sitting there with your hands in your hair Quit If you're through with it You are gonna make me sick No one cares who you carried to get here Quit In a quiet murmur of spit Cash it in with a whisper of wit Haven't seen them Loving your commitment The show of a man who feigns A love that I love Now I said it So by the time you come to We'll know just what to do We'll be singing and dancing For the death of romancing Yeah i have finally found her Yeah show me where it hurts Quit Here's your punishment You had the best you will ever see You wasted it and Now she sees the good in me Quit We could talk for hours and hours about you But we don't  We don't What good could that possibly do So by the time you come to She finally forgot you We'll be singing and dancing Our rebirth of romancing Yeah she has finally found me Yeah i'll show you where it hurts You won't hear me breathe I sleep so soundly hear me Stepping over heads to get ahead At that rate you will surely get your due But you'll have to wait around until you are dead You won't hear us breathe we sleep so soundly Your lost love and me We're not listening Put my headphones on and you'll all be goneAre you all you want Yes you are Now the worst comes out and how Who all had that heart Bless them all Watch them become background Once into the water Yes you are Now into the ground Found out what makes us shudder Yes you are Alive and turned up so loud So save your mortal soul No one has to know The kid we all control Arms length to the mirror Yes you are Betting on the bed to be there Are we coming clearer Yeah we are Fired up to be fed We're already all red Yes we are alone So sell that mortal soul No one has to know The kid we call control So when the covers lose color When you turn and go Say do you want to know what they know Not the slightest The kid we call control Now into the ground Yes we areSome days you can't help but wake up helpless The window world has got you all arms ready and Although I want to cheer you up in the worst way I can only muscle down a frown Some days I can't help but wake up helpless This goodnight girl has got me all arms ready and She might sell them all but i can tell The worth of her three weary words Not what you would guess Bow  arrow  apple Run for your life The ride is on fire All in tune All of this abandon I can barely stand it All in tune There's a lifetime of fun stuck between The machinery of your memory Go get it This certian sickness thst's sure to spin you But there's remedy in a formula that reads Easy as one two thirteenGirl we know you've won because you're hammering at everyone Girl we know you've won because you're screaming out and up above They're getting down, coming down Boy we know you've won because you're screaming out from up above Boy we know you won because you're dreaming of impossible love And getting down, coming down So own up The better part of one, I was screaming at everyone The better part of one I was rolling around on your rug and getting down, coming down You know I never could lose the part of me that moves all the energy to you Hook line and singer, I linger into Because I never could win the part of you that pulls me in And now we're at it again, inviting and then fighting off friendsSo the soldiers soak up all the sun And the company is continually struck dumb Now everyone wonders where we're from While the level-headed are heading for their homes Way before they come All I know is I'm never gonna go The safe way home So here's a clue for all you new boy destroyers Never ever think about granting us piece But please relieve the clarity and forget them Before our loyal own start moaning like children Before their uniformed brethren Send them to heaven All I know is I'm never gonna go The safe way home Quality time with the unkind is better than being alone It's all I know Why does every evening have to end this way Huddled in a bundle in a dark dark doorway Freezing please baby throw down some keys Let this kitten in Meow it's me All I know is I'm never gonna go The safe way home

way to save you Steady now City sister As the sky will fall You'll have your curtain call All in all You'll feel better than Better ever planned Then we'll line them up again All your men Soon you'll

control of what you'll be Or do you feel like you are trapped In a locked up trunk that's under the sea and You can't get out to drown Every turn Glued to the ground Wired out Your weight is hardly enough To drag me downLeft arm left numb cause blood won't come Hard pressed and tested to our tongues Fine friends then blend into the walls And we're sick to death of waiting on em So save that dedication to your frustration Cause the brilliance of a plan is in giving up There's nothing inspirational like watching angels drop The hardest part of playfighting is knowing when to stop We fund the function that will free Well hell, at least we all agree So roll in that polygraph machine Cause I don't know what to think and who to believe So save that dedication to your frustration Cause the brilliance of a plan is in giving up There's nothing inspirational like watching angels drop The hardest part of playfighting is knowing when to stop But don't stop now Cause I just want something better to remember Never any rest for the distressed The losers are alive and well In any given holding cell Time for dedication to your frustration Cause the brilliance of a plan is in giving up There's nothing inspirational like watching angels drop The hardest part of playfighting is knowing when to stopIs this the best you have to offer us You genius, your hair mussed By now you must have heard about the whirling world outside Twist a knife in it, I don't care Drain the life from it, I don't care If you can fake it you can take them like a photograph With a coy sigh in time With girlfriend waiting on the line Fine, but can't you wait to make her cry And they'll remember you alive As that pain in their unkind invitation tonight So here's your credit for the lie That you've been hanging And over awaiting your reply Is this the worst you have to peddle us Scandalous  oh, spare us By now they must have heard about your worried world inside Pull the covers up, I don't care Call all your lovers up, I don't care If the fates sing to your face queen of the raincloud club I lied when I said we were alike Your best friend waiting on the line To compliment your new shine I can hardly stand to stand here now To be your stare to admit to all The pain that you've been painting And over and I can't bear to stay
