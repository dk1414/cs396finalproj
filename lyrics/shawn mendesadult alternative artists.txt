I love it when you call me señorita I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya But every touch is ooh-la-la-la It's true, la-la-la Ooh, I should be runnin'Ooh, you keep me coming for ya Land in Miami The air was hot from summer rain Sweat drippin' off me Before I even knew her name, la-la-la It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah, no Sapphire moonlight We danced for hours in the sand Tequila Sunrise Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah I love it when you call me señorita I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya But every touch is ooh-la-la-la It's true, la-la-la Ooh, I should be runnin'Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya But every touch is ooh-la-la-la It's true, la-la-la Ooh, I should be runnin'Ooh, you keep me coming for yaI wanna follow where she goes I think about her and she knows it I wanna let her take control'Cause everytime that she gets close, yeah She pulls me in enough to keep me guessin' And maybe I should stop and start confessin', confessing, yeah Oh, I've been shaking I love it when you go crazy You take all my inhibitions Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back You take me places that tear up my reputation Manipulate my decisions Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back There's nothin' holdin' me back There's nothin' holdin' me back She says that she's never afraid Just picture everybody naked She really doesn't like to wait Not really into hesitationHelp me, it's like the walls are caving in Sometimes, I feel like giving up But I just can't It isn't in my blood Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something I could take to ease my mind slowly Just have a drink and you'll feel better Just take her home and you'll feel better Keep telling me that it gets better Does it ever Help me, it's like the walls are caving in Sometimes, I feel like giving up No medicine is strong enough Someone help me I'm crawling in my skin Sometimes, I feel like giving up But I just can't It isn't in my blood It isn't in my bloodI won't lie to you I know he's just not right for you And you can tell me if I'm off But I see it on your face When you say that he's the one that you want And you're spending all your time In this wrong situation And anytime you want it to stop I know I can treat you better than he can And any girl like you deserves a gentleman Tell me, why are we wasting time On all your wasted cryin'When you should be with me instead I know I can treat you better Better than he can I'll stop time for you The second you say you'd like me to I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing Baby, just to wake up with you Would be everything I need and this could be so different Tell me what you want to doAll it'd take is one flight We'd be in the same time zone Looking through your timeline Seeing all the rainbows, I I got an idea And I know that it sounds crazy I just wanna see ya Oh, I gotta ask Do you got plans tonight I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind Can't get you off my mind Can't get you off my mind I could feel the tension We could cut it with a knife I know it's more than just a friendship I can hear you think I'm right, yeah Do I gotta convince you That you shouldn't fall asleep It'll only be a couple hours And I'm about to leaveI thought that I'd been hurt before But no one's ever left me quite this sore Your words cut deeper than a knife Now, I need someone to breathe me back to life Got a feeling that I'm goin' under But I know that I'll make it out alive If I quit calling you my lover Move on You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking Falling onto my knees And now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needin' stitches Trippin' over myself, aching Begging you to come help And now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needin' stitches Just like a moth drawn to a flame Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain Your bitter heart, cold to the touch Now, I'm gonna reap what I sow I'm left seein' red on my ownI can't write one song that's not about you Can't drink without thinkin' about you Is it too late to tell you that Everything means nothing if I can't have you I'm in Toronto and I got this view But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed Spending all my nights reading texts from you Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance I know that you're the feeling I'm missing You know that I hate to admit it But everything means nothing if I can't have you I can't write one song that's not about you Can't drink without thinkin' about you Is it too late to tell you that Everything means nothing if I can't have you I can't write one song that's not about you Can't drink without thinkin' about you Is it too late to tell you that Everything means nothing if I can't have you You've got a hold on me Don't even know your power I stand a hundred feet But I fall when I'm around ya Show me an open door And you go and slam it on me I can't take anymore I'm saying Baby, please have mercy on me Take it easy on my heart Even though you don't mean to hurt me You keep tearing me apart Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart I'd drive through the night Just to be near you, baby Heart open, testify Tell me that I'm not crazy I'm not asking for a lot Just that you're honest with me And my pride is all I gotYou put me on a pedestal and tell me I'm the best Raise me up into the sky until I'm short of breath Fill me up with confidence, I say what's in my chest Spill my words and tear me down until there's nothin' left Rearrange the pieces just to fit me with the rest, yeah But what if I, what if I trip What if I, what if I fall Then am I the monster Just let me know And what if I, what if I sin And what if I, what if I break  Yeah Then am I the monster  Yeah Just let me know, yeah I was fifteen when the world put me on a pedestal I had big dreams of doin' shows and making memories Made some bad moves tryin' to act cool, upset by their jealousy, uh Liftin' me up , liftin' me up And tearin' me down , tearin' me down I'll take responsibility for everything I've done Holdin' it against me like you're the holy one Here I am, stuck on this couch scrolling through my notes Heart was broken, still not growing, nah Waking up to headlines, filled with devastation again My heart is broken, but I keep going Pain, but I won't let it turn into  hate No, I won't let it change me Never losing sight of the one I keep inside Now, I know it, yeah, I know it You can't take my youth away This soul of mine will never break As long as I wake up today You can't take my youth away You can't take my youth away This soul of mine will never break As long as I wake up today You can't take my youth away You can't take my youth away It's hard to sleep at night, knowing what's outside Feeling hopeless, I need focus You hit me with words I never heard come out your mouth To be honest, I don't want it, no
