Here and now I'm in the fire In above my head Being held under the pressure Don't know what'll be left But it's here in the ashes I'm finding treasure He's making diamonds, diamonds Making diamonds out of dust He is refining in His timing He's making diamonds out of us I'll surrender to the power Of being crushed by love Till the beauty that was hidden Isn't covered up Oh it's not what I hoped for It's something much better He's making diamonds, diamonds Making diamonds out of dust He is refining in His timing He's making diamonds out of usWhen you're at the end of the road And it's not the one that you would have chosen When you're at the end of your rope And you're holding on, but feel like you're falling With every option exhausted You've tried everything you know You saw a light then you lost it But there is still hope Like the fire in the night Like the ocean parted wide Like the grave, empty inside You will see He still does Miracles, miracles, miracles, miracles Even if you don't see it now Without a doubt, He's already moving There is not a pain that you hold He doesn't know, and He isn't using With every option exhausted You've tried everything you know So reach for something beyond it'Cause He is our hopeI want you as you are, not as you ought to be Won't you lay down your guard and come to Me The shame that grips you now is crippling It breaks My heart to see you suffering Cause I am for you I'm not against you If you wanna know How far My love can go Just how deep, just how wide If you wanna see How much you mean to Me Look at My hands, look at My side If you could count the times I'd say you are forgiven It's more than the drops in the ocean Don't think you need to settle for a substitute When I'm the only love that changes you And I am for you I'm not against you I am for you I'm not against youVerse 1:When we were younger We used to sit on my porch And talk smack about Girls and professional sports There's a lot of Things I wanted to say But never got a Chance to find a way Pre-chorus 1: take a good look at all of our high schools This is the first reason that I want to write you It must be tough when society is messed up Gotta save money, please don't take it out on us Do they even know Do they even know Chorus:If I was brave I'd write a letter to the president And have him pass it to the leaders of our parliament But for now I Won't say nothing From all the kids who would stand in my residence Who see this letter as a statement of our innocence But for now I Won't say nothingYou're not the only one who feels like this Feelin' like you lose more than you win Like life is just an endless hill you climb You try and try, but never arrive I'm tellin' you somethin'This racing, this running Oh, you're working way too hard!And this perfection you're chasing Is just energy wasted'cause He loves you like you are!So go ahead and live like you're loved It's ok to act like you've been set free His love has made you more than enough So go ahead and be who he made you to be And live like you're loved Live like you're loved Live like you're loved Live like you're loved And live like you're know you're valuable Like you know the one that hold your soul'Cause mercy has called you by your name Don't be afraid to live in that graceI ain't like no one you met before I'm running for the front When they're all running for the door And I won't sit down won't back out You can't ever shut me up Cause I'm on a mission And I won't quit now In a world full of followers I'll be a leader In a world full of doubters I'll be a believer I'm stepping out without a hesitation Because the battle's already been won I'm sold out I'm no longer living Just for myself Running after Jesus With my whole heart And now I'm ready to show I am sold out I'm sold out With every single Step that I take now With every drop of blood Left in my veins I'm gonna be making it count I am sold outI've been wrestling with my thoughts, I've been searching for daylight Tryin' to make sense of the mess, tryin' to feel like I'm alright All these questions without answers Feelin' restless and abandoned Will You hear my call Will You be there when I fall You say...All of this time and I've never let you down I carried you then, I'll carry you here and now So don't lose heart and don't forget My work in you ain't finished yet Hold on to me now, I'll never let you down I'll never let you down I'll never let you down I won't let you down Believe in me, I won't let you down Ne-ver let you down Let you down, let you down Oh, I've seen You showing up in the darkest of places In the moments of my doubt, in the tears that I've tasted Would You take me, take me this far Just to leave me, that's not who You areEverybody in the world moving so fast Can't find relief Looking for relief But I'm throwing my cares from the East to the West Cause you care for me You care for me Why would I let all these troubles come steal my joy When I know you hold my future you're in control I say no more, no more wasting a moment worrying about my life, my life Carried in your love God I know I got no burdens dragging me down My soul is lifted cause you're holding me now I give it all to you and I'm weightless I gave it all to you and I'm weightless Every bit of my stress that I keep inside I lay it at your feet And now I'm care free So I'm walking through the heavy feeling light A new reality But different gravity Why would I let all these troubles come steal my joy When I know you hold my future you're in controlWe're steppin' in the ring, yeah And won't let that lady sing It's over when we say it's over Been brushin' off our shoulders It's not a twist of fate We choose our own destiny A trophy or a bruise Champions never lose Champions never lose It's time to show the world What they've waited for Something like they've never seen before We're just getting started We're just getting started Reaching for the stars We'll raise our colors high We've come so far We're just getting started We're just getting started There's nothing stopping us Yeah we're just getting startedIf you're tired of running in circles Feeling like all your plans Are slipping right through your hands If you got troubles deep as an ocean Trying to breathe again But worries keep sinking in Just lift up your eyes to the sky You will find there's freedom on the other side For you and I I'm telling you there's no such thing as hopeless for a believer There's no such thing as broken for our Redeemer There's no war He can't win No fear He can't face No hurt that He can't heal No soul He can't save There's no such thing as hopeless for a believer No such thing!When it feels like you've heard it before But you haven't seen it yet You're still in the thick of it There is an invitation to be a new creation So let your soul awaken Let your soul awaken
