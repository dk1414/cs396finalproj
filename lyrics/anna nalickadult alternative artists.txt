2 A M and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake"Can you help me unravel my latest mistake I don't love him, Winter just wasn't my season"Yeah, we walk through the doors, so accusing, their eyes Like they have any right at all to criticize Hypocrites, you're all here for the very same reason'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable And life's like an hourglass glued to the table No one can find the rewind button, girl So cradle your head in your hands And breathe, just breathe Oh, breathe, just breathe May, he turned twenty-one on the base at Fort Bliss"Just a day," he said down to the flask in his fist Ain't been sober since maybe October of last year Here in town, you can tell he's been down for a while But, my God, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles Wanna hold him, maybe I'll just sing about it'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable And life's like an hourglass glued to the table No one can find the rewind button, boys So cradle your head in your hands And breathe, just breathe Oh, breathe, just breatheDriving away from the wreck of the day And the light's always red in the rear-view Desperately close to a coffin of hope I'd cheat destiny just to be near you If this is giving up Then I'm giving up If this is giving up Then I'm giving up, giving up On love, on love Driving away from the wreck of the day And I'm thinking 'bout calling on Jesus'Cause love doesn't hurt, so I know I'm not falling in love I'm just falling to pieces And if this is giving up Then I'm giving up If this is giving up Then I'm giving up, giving up On love, on loveHe loves the dawn But I am the night And I bet he wants Something beautiful, simple and bright But I think too much I love like I'm dyin'And I come and go like the moon Like the morn my face shows when I'm lyin'And I may not burn like some I bathe him in silver light And when the sunset comes I'll be lovin' him Lovin' him all through the night Well there was a time Many, in fact They called me Sunshine But only my mother knows that A kiss on his shoulder His chest and his hands And he talks so funny So I'd kiss his mouth and be Sunshine again But just for himI've run races Straight like laces My left writes rhymes When it's all wrong in my right mind My left don't know Where my right goes Or soul out window blows Ego shows up apropos though Head like driving range I say I can change It just tells me I'm lying Bullets through my brain You should hear how They shoot me down when I'm trying So this is where you're at now Lost your man and your big house So you can sit at your piano twenty hours a day And write a thousand words out of fear you've got nothing to say But I wanna get some Have fun while I'm still young Shotgun in the old flesh-bag tonight Cry about it, I'm gonna have the time of your life Your life, your lifeOh no we're all tied up Oh no our stars got crossed Got you into my world on a string And started building knots But I love your eyes like stars And all your thoughts on fate And everything you are And how you radiate and All I want is my fingers in your hair And I'm tangled up as tightly as I dare And I know you're just another life away And they say if you want something bad enough you'll wait But I'd hate to be wrong So I tangle me in strings 'cause I'm strung out on the way we're spiraling I'm a cyclone and every revolution's confused It's a shame that you seek resolution when I want to stay Tied up All tied up All tied up You say the universe has ways Of cleaning all this up But I miss your funny face And you know I don't miss muchL.A  lights Never shine quite as bright as in the movies Still wanna go 'Cause something here In the way, in the way that we're constantly moving Reminds you of home So you're taking these pills for to fill up your soul And you're drinking them down with cheap alcohol And I'd be inclined to be yours for the taking And part of this terrible mess that you're making But me, I'm the catalyst When you say love Is a simple chemical reaction Can't say I agree'Cause my chemical, yeah Left me a beautiful disaster Still love's all I see So I'm taking these pills for to fill up my soul And I'm drinking them down with cheap alcohol And you'd be inclined to be mine for the taking And part of this terrible mess that I'm making But you, you're the catalystYou say you fell while holding diamonds in your hands"It's your fault for running, holding diamonds," I said And I offer no sympathy for that I hear that it was you who died alone And I offer no sympathy for that Better off I sparkle on my own And someday, yeah, yeah Love will find me in the rough Someday, yeah, yeah Love will finally be enough I turned around three times And wound up at your door Now you say you know all you did not know before And I offer no sympathy for that I hear that it was you who died alone And I offer no sympathy for that Better off I sparkle on my ownYour favorite color is the color of my aura, aura Your favorite color is the color of my aura, aura Aren't you gonna take me home Battle religions switch hits and pitches, visions My piss and vinegar cannot condone Bet on my loose refuge To something so unreal Steals my two eyes off you Just wanna be naked and weightless before I lose you too Down to the river Under the water I found a savior Down at the bottom Down to the river Under the water I found a savior Down at the bottom Pretty little miss slimness gives kisses on the wrist with the twist of a lymphis Stop, no God I'm no Lolita I won't follow the leader But I wish I was pretty like that, pretty like that, pretty like that But I'd never be free like that, free like that, free like thatWhen she knew they had lost each other She came back from L A and she fucked his brother Now she's one more in the running for deciphering his tongue Like that hieroglyphic battle by Champollion and Young But he's a stone, whoa Whoa He's a stone Whoa I am cryptic as the ages Been writing riddles since I first put ink to pages But I know that love is music if we play with open hands And my love won't need to read the score, he'll see and understand That I'm a stone, whoa Whoa I'm a stone Whoa We're a stone's throw away from our own language And if I wasn't the Victorian type, I would tell him so Vanquish any doubt But there's something about competition that leaves a bad taste in my mouth We're a stone We're a stone's throwDear lover, this is the last time I'm on my knees but always up in arms And just because it was a good dream Don't make winter warm Don't burn and fade away And when I said it's the last time Paper dolls could not be more cut up'Cause I threw my armor down the day My iron blocked your touch Don't burn and fade away It's a stalwart's win Every time you breathe for me When you say you will When you don't, you scream me half a truth And I'm tired of feeling that from you I know I said it's the last time But I can't breathe without you on my tongue And I think that I could live without lungs But I've grown tired of iron
