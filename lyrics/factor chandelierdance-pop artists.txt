popping some bravery Lifes caught up in slavery Minds plotting behaviour With 9 Glocks for the neighbors And pine box to the savioursBaby I'll talk you into this hope avoid these hockey skates to the throat Walk with me through this psychiatric hat-trick let's go I don't have the ability nor the agility to enter your nightmares and pull you through the humility of what your deepest darkest secrets mean to be I just don't, want you, to be mean to me If this chemical, the feeling is identical to the suffocating suction of a octopus's tentacle it's not But this situations clinical but know That our salvation is critical Whatever it is, if not the subject of ridicule just don't ever think that I would ever wanna get rid of you There's nothing more beautiful, that when I enter the inner you the louder we interface the more we're in outer space The ward that we seem to face, or the door to the divinity of the infinity that we always seem to chase Embrace the mental illness that fills your mental wellness'Cause bein' well, well, means you go to the well I said well, let's be real, we're all a little off the beaten path Some of us cheated death and some of us just cheat at math Listen My mind, is always under attack I'm under the radar but overly conscious watching my back The lack, of understanding for so long gives me a cramp I could only fly for so long and high, off of this ramp The inner workings of a complex mind, can't be diagrammed Much less, put to perfect poetry, but I'll try a gram Can there be a way for me and my girl, to be insane yet utterly humane And I live a life, in vain, the pain within the painting is a painting of the same When you paying for the painting you payin', for the frame A frame of mind, is sturdy yet colors runnin' the rain as they run off the painting and overlap The frame, the painting disappear, as the colors become stains, and some view it as a problem Colors do not sustain, whats left is just the frame, and a very caustic stain And the philosophy, to create once againGoing on a walk to clear my head First step: gotta crawl out of bed I'll tell all the jokes around here I am dirty and the mud is clear The banks of the river never run out of money And over the years, things are less funny The original ones are disappointed Society, humanity anointed Three generation specialists Watchmen close down the bar I will deep fry these words'Cause they have won awards And when I'm hurt she kisses my stab wounds Listen to my tempo, gentlemen I'm wearing my skeleton on tour And I never been a better man Going on an angry walk again Moby Dick, Larry David, leviathan Guess who's back in the motherfucking pond Dickfish Pepper whistling the sweater song It's been too long since I chilled with Walrus One The years fly by but the days drag on The little songs are ghosts on stand-by Wanted to escape from L A like Kurt Russell Felt like I was famous for a bit When I opened for Freestyle Fellowship But you can't buy real estate in people's minds Homie, you have to earn that shit So I'll quit alienating my friends and family With talks of conspiracy theories And maybe try being agreeable To the people that wanna be near meYou must be insane, coming to me I can help you out, but nothing is free Give me everything you own and you won't die alone Show me what you got,  and gold Get on your knees, close your eyes Hold my hands, feel the light Take a look, she's fucking died Say my name when you see her smile Don't scream, she cannot hear you Don't get up, she cannot feel you Clear your mouth, bring my blood And if you won't, then you will die tonight She will be alive tomorrow, you will both be free She will be alive tomorrow, you'll be thanking me She will be alive tomorrow, you will both be free She will be alive tomorrow, you'll be thanking me Today ain't your lucky day Don't believe every word I say You took a chance, you're a fool I see you standing with empty hands There ain't no magic, heaven or hell I walk away and leave my land You never met me, I don't exist Don't say a word, or you will die tonight She won't be alive tomorrow, you'll never be free She won't be alive tomorrow, you won't be thanking me She won't be alive tomorrow, you'll never be free She won't be alive tomorrow, you won't be thanking meMake it feel better Make it heal Make it end please Baby Make it feel so good Make it Cotton candy Oxy contin candy I want you to know right now I want you to know right now I want you Maybe More Than ever Taste heaven inside you By the time that I'm empty and quiet I realize what love can do It can make even tame dogs violent It'll stare you in the face and laugh Take away your pain then bring it back It'll kiss you on the lips so fast Revert you to a kid then Stab your back
