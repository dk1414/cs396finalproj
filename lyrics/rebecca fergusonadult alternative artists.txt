First of all, I'm sorry For everything we did We never meant to hurt you We never meant to sin And now the rules are callin'Out our names And now the call is dawnin'We'll never be same But what is love without a little cryin'?What is love without desire What is love without us facing trial What is love without you Temptation caught my eye Couldn't let him just pass by Following my instincts Felt so good to be alive For a moment I forgot myself For a moment I was freeJust a mood Just a touch Just a feeling Know my tells Hide it well But you see right through'Cause you always do Say I'm fine All the time When it's killing me Keep away Cross the line But the truth cuts through Like you always do I know I'm crazy When the chemicals in my head are raging And the floor beneath my feet won't stop shaking You're my uncrazy You're my uncrazy When the light behind my eyes is fading And the walls in my wild heart start to cave in You're my uncrazyHow good or bad, happy or sad Does it have to get Losing yourself, no cry for help You don't think you need it And old friends are just a chore But now you need 'em more than ever before All that glitter and all that gold Won't buy you happy When you've been bought and sold Riding wild horses you can't control With all your glitter and all of your gold Take care of your soul Take care of your soul, soul, soul, soul How high, how low, how on your own Are you gonna get Because losing your soul will cost you more Than that life you're paying forI used to hate you so easily Look into your eyes so eagerly And whether is cold I wouldn't walk away Cause when there's money love is blind It's so blind But after a time I realized that for me to grow I've got to let go I hope life treats you good I hope life treats you good I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope I hope life treats you well I hope she treats you well I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope I hope that she's kind I hope that she's kind I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope Cause after a time you realize that it ain't easy Cause after a time you realize that you should've believed in me I hope life treats you good I hope life treats you good I hope, I hope, I hope, I hopeOne foot onto the ice I hold my breath and try to believe Can I look at you with different eyes Like the girl that I was when I was seventeen The fallen empires, the shattered glass The wicked echoes of my past I've seen it all before, that's why I'm asking Will you still be here tomorrow Or will you leave in the dead of the night So your waves don't crash around me I'm staying one step ahead of the tide Will you leave me lost in my shadows Or will you pull me into your light Teach me how to be loved Teach me how to be loved I got caught up in a daze of the wine and roses Such a sweet escape But I watched it all slip away Like running water through my hands Raining on this picture landStanding in a line, wonder why it don't move Tryna get a hand, watching people break the rules And maybe the man in charge doesn't like my face But then this world's not always good And nothing's real but love Nothing's real but love No money, no house, no car can beat the love They watch us open-mouthed as we joke around like fools See who can be the worst, watch what I can do But then the door gets slammed, slammed right in my face And I guess this world's not always good And nothing's real but love Nothing's real but love No house, no car, no job can beat the love Oh, it won't fill you up No money, no house, no car is like love La, la, la, la, ah La, la, la, la YeahThere is hope Even as the tears fall on your lips Even as you take another sip And cough from all you smoked the night before Didn't lose the war So stand back up and be a man Hold yourself complete again And say the words I am free, I am free It's the sound of peace There is laughs Even when all you got is a box of flowers They gave you as they held you to the ground But over the hills call out sounds Spill up, break heavy grounds Angels dress, they dance around You can hear it, you can feel it The sounds says I am free It's the sound of peace Yeah, I am free, I am free It's the sound of peace And it's freedom, sweet freedom I was so dumb They held me to the ground But now I'm free now I'm free now, oh I...I...and now I'm free...But now I'm free, oh There is hope Even as the tears fall on my lips Even as I take another sip And cough from all I've smoked the night before I didn't lose the war I'll stand back up and be a man Hold myself complete again And say the words I am free I am free It's the sound of peaceWhen you're lonely Don't be afraid, I'll keep your heart close to mine Lay safe in my arms Lay safe in my arms When I'm falling I won't stay down'Cause I will hold you Lay safe in my arms Lay safe in my arms When you feel you've had enough From this world that's giving up on you On you...Sometimes we can relax walking through the fire And when it all turns to dust We'll watch the ashes light up and we'll rise We'll rise And we'll be fine And we'll be fine 'Cause I feel safe when your near me And I can hold you completely Although you constantly hurt me And we fight and we cry And we tell the same lies about love And we cling to each other Shoulder to shoulder against the world So I'm gonna drag you down Whilst you drag me down And I'm gonna shout at you Whilst you shout at me Until we realise that real love is free, free And I get a kick when you worry That you're just no good for me And I feel weak watching you plead And we fight and we cry And we tell the same lies about love And we cling to each other Shoulder to shoulder against the worldI wish that you could see who I really am It's tough being a woman in love with an unkind man Cause baby I'd give you the world, in fact, I already do And how do you repay that Talk to me like I'm just a regular tramp tryna do you over Have you even got a clue, what I gave up just to be here Serve you with your steak and beer 'Cause baby that's love And baby that's real And all I've ever wanted was for your loving arms To wrap themselves around me and say Hey girl, you're the prettiest thing my eyes have ever seen Come and lay your bones down with me Come and lay your bones down with me Hey girl, you're the prettiest thing my heart has ever known Come and lay your bones down with me Come and lay your bones down I'm not tryna play the victim, don't wanna go head to head But boy I shouldn't have to stand in the mirror convincing myself I'm fair Baby that's your job to do And baby you should say I'm beautiful Why do you wanna watch the set when I'm layin' right next to you in my own room I feel like you don't even know I'm there But I put a brush through my hair for you Run my fingertips over your back real smooth
