Dancer in the night Playing with my eyes Velvet tongue so sweet Say anything you like Crush me with the lie And tell me once or twice That love is paradise That love is paradise Amo Amas Amat Amamus Amatis Amant Amavi Amavisti Amavit Amavimus Amavistis Amaverunt Amavero Amaveris AmaveritOh, why is your hate so addicting And I, well, I wonder where you've been I don't see you often I try to feel something for you But that's all that I can do Give my shadow to you Do you ever see me at night And does it please you at all When you head up the wall I'd go with you if you asked me to But we wouldn't get too far Two strangers in the darkYou wanna know me, well, what’s to know Do I amuse you, when the night is slow Do your eyelids ever close Caught spirits in your waking woes I know where to find you, I know where you go And I just want to let you know You can have me, you can have me all You can have me, you can have me all And you’re twisted, what can I say Your days are empty and my tongue is decayed And we stay up just to tempt me One more night of your company I know where to find you, I know where you go And I just want to let you know You can have me, you can have me allInnocent love I need someone somewhere I need somewhere to come down I need some way to make you smile Innocent love I need someone somewhere I need somewhere to come down I need some way to make you smile We're not happy 'til we're running away Clouds in your eyes With nothing but the foggiest day One of a kind I need to keep you here I need to picture you still I need to clear the fog One of a kind I need to keep you here I need to picture you still I need to clear the fog We're not happy 'til we're running away Clouds in your eyes With nothing but the foggiest day Clouds in your eyes We're not happy 'til we're running away Clouds in your eyes With nothing but the foggiest dayYou weigh on my mind Like pieces of you stuck to me And I needed time to be there To feel myself move again Whenever I want you You are mine Whenever you tell me It's going to be fine And I thought you were mine to be And I thought you'd be good for me But I know what you are now And I know what you are now And I thought you were onto me And I thought you'd be good for me But I know what you are now And I know what you are now In the mural room Aligning the tapestry Thousands of years spent A missed opportunityPull the blinds All the black dreams I've had Well they don't mean much now When I rise at noon I'm missing someone I don't know And I don't want to be alone And this house is now a grave I've been sleeping here for days I'm too hidden to awake So I disappear always Call someone up Just to have a drink We can talk about anything, I don't care Getting out of the house For an hour or two But it's missing something I can't explain And this house is now a grave I've been sleeping here for days I'm too hidden to awake So I disappear alwaysYou don't know, I've got nothing to say anymore It's a shame I know, we're both perfectly in loathe Lets not say you never give me anything I don't care, I was what I was right there Do I really need to tell you That I've got a twisted twin soul for you I've got a palm I'm reaching for you Do I really need to tell you That I've got a twisted twin soul for you I've got a palm I'm reaching for you In your eyes, I've got nothing to see anymore To convince me enough to compromise my heart Let's not say its just a game again Cause we both know we're both perfectly in loathe Do I really need to tell you That I've got a twisted twin soul for you I've got a palm I'm reaching for youIt's getting hard for me To reframe all those shifting memories Like a music box that Never starts dancing by itself What a broken world, what a broken world But it's my own Just to see you, to see through you I step inside Letting go, I want to be happier now I want to be more than close Surreal, the way you made me out The way you crash me down It's getting hard for me To remember all of the names from my life You've been so many Different kinds of people in my mind Letting go, I want to be happier now I want to be more than close Surreal, the way you made me out Letting go, I want to be happier now I want to be more than close Surreal, the way you made me out The way you crash me downYou speak in tongues I can't resist You run me 'round I cannot think We're driving to your parent's house just for a visit And I'm sleeping in your brother's bed Won't you sneak into my room and crawl under the covers Talk nonsense in your sleep You come unguarded once again And I can't wait to let you in We're driving to your parent's house just for a visit And I'm sleeping in your brother's bed Won't you sneak into my room and crawl under the covers Talk nonsense in your sleep You've got some charm I must admit Don't let me wreck myself again I'm driving to your parent's house just for a visit And I'm sleeping in your brother's bed Won't you sneak into my room and crawl under the covers Talk nonsense in your sleepDressed in the moonlight and paler than bone She has got something that I've never known I couldn't explain it I won't even try
