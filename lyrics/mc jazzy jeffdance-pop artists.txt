me up from my date of birth And she slaved and gave me everything on Earth Now in times of health and in times of sickness She was there to take care of business Mother taught me right, when I did wrong Oh yes, I'm blessed to be bright and so strong And when life seemed tough, there was no way Momma helped me out, each and every day She said "Don't you steal, don't you rob""Just be a man and go get a job", huh My motherPeople pushin', shovin', almost huggin'Fighting for a seat how they be buggin'Lookin' like nuts, carrying cups It's just too much I'm about to give up Now oh no, that's right

King, when he spoke to me So I dropped the drugs and fell to my knees So I sworn to God, and I made you know I wouldn't do it again, now that's how I spoke And it came from my body, and my soul That my kicks and habits, I will control Since I do wanna live and don't want to die But I was killing myself, when I got high So I slowly stopped, bit by bit I want to tell it to the world, yes, I quit Hear this, oh yes I quit Hear this, yes, I quit Hear this, oh yes I quit Hear this, yes, I quit Now I'm walkin' down the street with my head up high I done kicked the habit and I'm satisfied That I can rap to you, and not blow my cool'Cause God knows it's a shame what I've been through Now, I'ma tell it like it is and that's a fact So if you're tryin' to quit, listen to my rap Well, I made up my mind and just stuck to it To never use drugs, now I won't do it It wasn't so easy, to quit was hell When the addicts and the pushers kept ringin' my bell Drivin' me crazy, givin' me fits I blew their minds when I told 'em I quitPut it down stop what you're doin', your life will be ruined It's a drug, use it, abuse it and you will bug Or it'll thrill ya, and chill ya, yes and then it'll kill ya So
