See the snow falling on the ground Days of old, oh so cold Wretched sailing amongst the cloud Melts the snow, still it's cold People dancing in the streets In the town, a small boy cries Eyes of love turn to nerves of stone Blind the sun, not for me A season goes so quickly You don't know where you are A season goes so quickly You don't know where you are I said I'm sorry Don't you know I try Everybody's watching And it makes me cry See the snow falling on the ground Days of old, oh so coldSometimes disaster Is just what it takes To open up your sleepy eyes Go outside when moring breaks Speaking of chariots Words swinging low Shadows flowing from your brush Lingering, never changing Minister of fate Declares that you're remiss Upon the lips of hate He gives a callous kissÉtiennne your silhouettes Promises that turned into lies I can't see you Étiennne So many eyes looking at you Stumbling through blackened woods Cold-hearted ecstasy Mistaken for love Bitter death has left behind A treasure in my mindHot and cold shivers up and down your spine The blues lose that hold on your mind Get off your shoes, get yourself high-igh Let yourself have a rea-eal good time Tell your friends the truth You've been bop-bop, boppin' the blue-ues Bop-bop, I'm boppin' the blues, yeah-heah-heah Bop-bop, I'm boppin' the blues, ah-hah-hah Bop-bop, I'm boppin' the blues Bop-bop, I'm
