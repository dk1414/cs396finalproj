Ramblers in the wilderness we can't find what we need We get a little restless from the searching Get a little worn down in between Like a bull chasing the matador is the man left to his own schemes Everybody needs someone beside em' shining like a lighthouse from the sea Brother, let me be your shelter Never leave you all alone I can be the one you call When you're low Brother, let me be your fortress When the night winds are driving on Be the one to light the way Bring you home Face down in the desert now there's a cage locked around my heart I found a way to drop the keys where my failures were Now my hands can't reach that far I ain't made for rivalry I could never take the world alone I know that in my weakness I am strong But it's your love that brings me home Brother, let me be your shelter Never leave you all alone I can be the one you call When you're low Brother, let me be your fortress When the night wheels are driving on Be the one to light the way Bring you homeSinging oh, happiness Singing oh, happiness I got a homesick heart but a long ways left to go I've been doing my part but I ain't got much to show So I'm asking you to show me some forgiveness It's all for you in my pursuit of happiness Chasing that life, moving on 'cause I had to prove There ain't no life worth doing what I did to you So I'm asking you to show me some forgiveness It's all for you in my pursuit of happiness I got dreams that keep me up in the dead of night Telling me I wasn't made for the simple life There's a light I see, but it's far in the distance I'm asking you to show me some forgiveness It's all for you in my pursuit of happiness Singing oh, happiness Singing oh, happinessI wanna be there when the voices in your head Are loud enough to make you lose your mind Just the same when you're dominating the day I wanna be the one who's by your side You know my love is not the jealous type It doesn't matter if we win or lose I could stay or I could come No matter where you're coming from I could be the one to let you choose I wanna hold you close but never hold you back Just like the banks to the river And if you ever feel like you are not enough I'm gonna break all your mirrors I wanna be there when the darkness closes in To make the truth a little clearer I wanna hold you close but never hold you back I'll be the banks for your river I'll be the banks for your river I'll be the banks for your riverWoo-oo-oo Woo-oo-oo White lies and desperation Hard times and conversations No one  should ever love me like You do Sometimes my bad decisions Define my false suspicions No one should ever love me like You do Oh, while I'm on this road, You take my hand Somehow You really love who I really am I push You away, still You won't let go You grow Your roses on my barren soul Who am I, who am I, who am I To be loved by You Who am I, who am I, who am I To be loved by You Who am I, who am I, who am I To be loved by You Who am I, who am I, who am I Da-doo, da-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo Da-doo, da-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo Da-doo, da-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo Da-doo, da-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo It's time for moving on There's some things you can't forget It's sinking us like a stone I just wanna bury it I wanna watch all my bridges burn Stand in the rain 'til the page is turned Dance in the light of a lesson learned, lesson learned I wanna leave everything that hurts Never go back to the way we were Set it on fire, baby, watch it burn, watch it burn Da-doo, da-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo Da-doo, da-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo Out into the unknown We traded in our regrets Not gonna go alone'Cause we're gonna finish thisI won't pretend That we can control the night Or what kind of road we're on Or where we will see the light But right now I'm talking to ya I'm looking into your eyes Right now I'm trying to show ya That we're gonna be alright Oh I don't know What's around the bend Oh all I know Is that my love It knows no end All these pieces they fall in line Because I'm forever on your side Take my hand when you can't see the light'Cause I'm forever on your side I will carry you every time Because I'm forever on your side Oh I'm forever on your sideTrading punches with the heart of darkness Going to blows with your fear incarnate Never gone until it's stripped away A part of you has gotta die to change In the morning you gon' need an answer Ain't nobody gonna change the standard It's not enough to just feel the flame You've gotta burn your old self away Hold on tight a little longer What don't kill ya, makes ya stronger Get back up, 'cause it's a hard love You can't change without a fallout It's gon' hurt, but don't you slow down Get back up, 'cause it's a hard love You know the situation can't be right And all you ever do is fight But there's a reason that the road is long It take some time to make your courage strongAin't no gift like the present tense Ain't no love like an old romance Gotta make hay when the sun is shinin'Can't waste time when it comes time to dance Slammin' this door with a heavy hand Signin' this line like a deed to land Keeping in touch with the windows down Dreading this night since the rain hit the ground Long live the heart Long live the soul That knows what it wants That piece you can find That part is the whole It never lets go Always tryin to be the one outlaw Goes where he wants, never does get caught Pushing this line like the Lord ain't comin'Building this house like they're scared of something elseYeah, isn't it amazing how a man can find himself alone Call into the darkness for an answer that's he's never known Yeah, isn't it amazing how a God can take a broken man Yeah, let him find a fortune, let him ruin it with his own two hands And he climbs on up the hill On the rock on which he stands He looks back at the crowd And he looks down at his hands and he says:"I am a difference maker"Oh, I am a difference maker Oh, I am the only one that speaks to Him And I am the friendliest of friends of God Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Yeah, isn't it amazing how a man can find himself alone Call into the darkness for an answer that's he's never known Yeah, isn't it amazing how a God can take a broken man Yeah, let him find a fortune, let him ruin it with his own two hands In Your ocean I'm ankle deep I feel the waves crashing on my feet It's like I know where I need to be But I can't figure out, yeah, I can't figure out Just how much air I will need to breathe When Your tide rushes over me There's only one way to figure out But will You let me drown Yeah, will You let me drown And hey now, this is my desire Consume me like a fire'Cause I just want something beautiful to touch me I know that I'm in reach'Cause I am down on my knees And waiting for something beautiful Oh-oh Oh-oh Oh, something beautiful And the water is rising quick And for years I was scared of it We can't be sure when it will subside So I won't leave Your side No, I can't leave Your side
