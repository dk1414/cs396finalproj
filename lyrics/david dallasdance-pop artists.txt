ROne minute she wants you, then she wants to leave, all I can do is take the good with the bad and keep on Gotta work hard, gotta give the fans the mean songs Give these programmers more shit that they can sleep on Give these bitin' cunts more shit that they can feast on Money come and go out your life like the seasons People do too, sometimes without a reason And it kind of seemed wrong when they took his life Shoulda killed this dude, he's a fuckin' dick right Maybe get some insight from Jesus, Allah, Jehova Some will pray on Sunday, some'll spend it hungover Whether drunk or sober, hearts are gettin' colder Globe is gettin' warmer, baby, this is karma, for real Woke up feelin' down, now I'm feelin' great Things can really flip around on you in a day But till tomorrow, till tomorrow Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh Payday—I'm rich, next day—I'm poor Sittin' on my bed, wonder why I bother for But till tomorrow, till tomorrow Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-ohOh-oh-ah-oh-oh-oh-ah-oh

bus from the old bar which was to go Into town rolling through Otahuhu depot Thinking how we ended up here Yeah no secret theres some people doing tough here Could be rough here, if your parents come here from an island In the hope of a better life for the child and an education But they ain't got time to keep an eye on 'em They workin' every day, they won't even see retirement School don't teach you to deal with this environment Another poly kid left to his own devices And you look at what they reinforce When they talk about us doing crime, playing sports Standing in the dole line, or in the court Think it don't affect us all Hook Look at boys from the Southside If you looking from the outside Some scared to death when they see us Cos every 10/7 they featurin'Boys from the Southside But we represent it with pride When you feel you come from the bottom Til you reach the top, ain't no stopping 'em Boys from the SouthsideI don't want the world, I want you!One man band, walk to my own drum Call me self-centered but it takes one and no one Guess I had a one track mind from the start Trying to make these songs get better at my craft Get upon the charts maybe get a couple plaques And in the process might break a couple hearts Part of the game tho I said you told me But things changed and I'm not the old me Learned a few tricks of the trade Learnt that I don't wanna be alone at the end of the day Had to hit you on the phone everytime i was awake Can't do it on my own, really need for you to stay Tho you hear me say it alot I'm busy doing this step further, and make it to the top Since thay never expire, but for you i'd drop it all in a sec cause there is none higher Pull the rug from underneath me, take away all that I made Feel like all I need is you, for me to see another day Pull the rug underneath me, take away all I possess Feel like all I need is you, all I need is you Cause I know you've seen, that the boy got big dreams You might think that the only thing i serve is me But I hang up my boots, make a promise to you Cause the truth is I don't want the world, I want you Yeah, I said it's D-dot D-A-double-L-A-S, she just thinkin'L MF AO, tell that she ain't well impressed'Cause we ain't on telly yet, ain't gettin' those spins like Rihanna "Umbrella" yet, so she actin' celibate But I’m in my element, I don’t take that shit to heart I like provin' them wrong just to make myself look smart They see the future as a blur, to me it's lookin' sharp Smart money's on me, you should get in from the start So we order four shots of raw Jäger, while the bottle pours Think of how it's gonna feel when you know you got it all'Cause we on the bottom floor, lookin' at the top and all People said we're crazy, but they just bet on lotto balls They just wish for things to fall into their lap, I’m on a mission For it, I won’t sit and pause until it happens Baby, quit your chitter chatter yappin', kick back and handle the shot In a couple years, you won't believe you met us in this spot So you should take a picture, ca-chick, take a flick Before the world's up on this shit and say this You were down when they weren’t When no one gave a damn what we did Here we are, pourin' out shots At the bar, swearin' one day We’ll be stars, take a flick Before the world's up on this shitYeah, yeah I'm high upon a new wave of confidence I'm trying to ride it to a few different continents Known in the country that I'm from but anonymous To most of the populous in dominant marketplaces I'm from New Zealand and their not used to seeing different faces And they don't ever turn the radio to different stations I gotta do it though cause Mum's getting sick of waiting When I was young she used to tell me "Have some fucking patience"But she loved the baby boy, raise the bar like I'm on roids On my game like I'm on joysticks, still playing with these toys I'm grateful for the voice I've been given Big boy now no purple ribbon 'bout to have all of the shutterbugs flicking Straight sippin' vodka soda with the twist in Jamiroquai playing I don't say it to be different It's still hip hop in the vein, Smirnoff in the brain Always been a cool dude I'll let you know if it change I'm kicking back, feeling good on a Friday Ain't letting all the bullshit get in my way Know that I stay Caught in a daze Caught in a daze Caught in a daze Caught in a dazeYeah D-dot D-A And Ché, ayy Know the boy D-Double do it all day Get to messin' with his tracks, no foreplay Seems simple now but it wasn't always Used to sit up in the Pap' High hallways Teacher put me there sayin' that I talk too much I thought I knew it all but I never knew much I come school late 'cause my form room sucked And we hang out by the canteen all through lunch Young teen with a pack mentality No dream, I can make reality, all I care about's popularity Tryna pass Jessica, tryna get a touch And a Mufti day try them with some new Chucks Try them with some new Nikes or something They didn't give a fuck about assignments or nothing Didn't make music even though I loved it Scared to try hard, too shy I'd get busted So I sit on the sideline Just bidin' my time If I could be in their shoes The things that I'd do But wishin' won't get you nowhere Don't be scared to go there If you sittin', why wait Do it the right way, yeah, yeahYeah, yeah From the pacific isle of Samoa via Middlemore And

The top cats is looking weak; I look gorilla strong Ain't kidding, dawg, King Kong ain't got shit on me Word to Curren$y, I'm flyin' but ain't got weed on me You can catch me on a long haul ridin' Air New Zealand or Qantas Me and Che hit the states with no sponsors And accomplished more than most these fuck head labels did Even though they had untold grinds to pay for shit Pushing trash indie bands whose resume's paper-thin That play South by once then never play again I play to win, put money on the line I don't have And say, "fuck it, if I fail, it ain't so bad Bein' broke, I'd rather take a risk than be a joke Who thinks he's really livin' life when he ain't leavin' home"I'm tryna see the world, they just tryna meet some girls And get in the club for free for a weekend splurge See how quick they're on my dick when I reemerge On some Jean Grae shit, they just real gay pricks D-dot D-A, bitch, say it with authority People askin', "What's good " I'm in that minority You thinkin' music sucks now, they're in that majority Ain't in no fraternity, they prob'ly in sororities And we don't even have those where I'm from People say the clocks tickin' down till I blow up, I'm a time bomb
