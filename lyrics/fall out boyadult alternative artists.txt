damn world went and lost its mind And all my childhood heroes have fallen off or died Fake tears, real living, fake tears But the alcohol never lies, never lies Some princes don't become kings Even at the best of times I'm out of my mind You only get what you grieve, are you smelling that shit Are you smelling that shit  Eau de résistancePut on your war paint You are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground We are the jack-o-lanterns in July Setting fire to the sky Here, here comes this rising tide so come on Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope to die Silver clouds with grey linings So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked One maniac at a time we will take it back You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start So dance alone to the beat of your heart Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel Like our time is running out I'm going to change you like a remix Then I'll raise you like a phoenix Wearing our vintage misery No, I think it looked a little better on me I'm going to change you like a remix Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
