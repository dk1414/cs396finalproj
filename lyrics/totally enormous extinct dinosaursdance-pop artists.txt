Ooh, watching wild skies Wishing with closed eyes Ooh, run for a lifetime Follow the signs I put my pictures down They're not as good as the real thing"I wish I could go home"You're just nostalgic What do we wander from and only notice it now So be here with me And I watched the water unfold It's a feeling I want you to know'Cause I'm not the same as I was As I shoulder the weight of the world I was setting in stone until I noticed it right Do you see how you've grown Don't be sorry, then And I fall from my bones And now I know I'm alive I want you to find itLookin' over your shoulder, girl Thinkin' you should've let me have it all If you're comin' around again Tell me how you feel, 'cause I need to know, know, know Know, know, know Know, know, know I could be your love again If you just let me in We don't have to work it out'Cause I already know Lookin' over your shoulder, girl Thinkin' you should've let me have it all If you're comin' around again Tell me how you feel, 'cause I need to know, know, know Lookin' over your shoulder, girl Thinkin' you should've let me have it all If you're comin' around again Tell me how you feel, 'cause I need to know, know, know Know, know, know Know, know, knowEverywhere I look, I just see you on your own All that it took was one call from his phone Forgive me if I'm wrong, but you look shit all alone So give me a shot, 'cause I could be the dog to your bone Or something Even after all, all the bad things that you've shown We should be together to share in this love in my home I know I'm not wrong, you still look shit all alone So give me
