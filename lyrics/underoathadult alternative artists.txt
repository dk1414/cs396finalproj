Can you feel your heartbeat racing Can you taste the fear in her sweat You've done this wrong It's too far gone, these sheets tell of regret I admit that I'm just a fool for you I am just a fool for you Here is where we both go wrong Tonight's your last chance to Do exactly what you want to And this could be my night This is what makes me feel alive, makes you feel alive Here is where we both go wrong So sign me up and toss this key'Cause for now we're living In this moment that we both ignore the truth It's all over, it's all over I feel your heart against mine So take a breath and close your eyes, eyesMaybe we, why don't we Sit right here for half an hour We'll speak of what a waste I am And how we missed your beat again I swear we need to find some comfort in this Run down place To bridge the gap of this conscious state that we live in And I'm short on time How come you try  That brings us home To fit the shape of,  and I pray for What they tell you, you to move on, move on But mostly what they show you At this rate we can't keep up, I'm taking back all the things I've said I'm taking back all the things I've said But I sure can't just sit still Keep me filled in, I swear I'll come We walk alone, we walk alone We walk alone, we walk alone We walk alone, we walk alone Back home, alone, back homeLet's get this straight I'm fine without you I'm not your fucking prey So save yourself And no one else What you believe What you believe What you believe Your life is a lie Get over it Get over it Get over it!You got the best of me And stabbed me in the back I taste you on my teeth You're like a heart attack And I'm not okay I'm heading down the drain I still feel safe Down here where I belongI've been up at this all night long I've been drowning in my sleep I've prayed for your safe place And it's time for us to leave Time is running, it's running on empty And the gas is running out I've decided that tonight is the night that I let love aside Full speed ahead, this seems to be the place I've seen this once before Planned perfection sought in my dreams Hoping this would take you home My knuckles have turned to white There's no turning back tonight Kiss me one last time Around this turn where the cross will cast your shadow The people will all gather To remember such a day where the flames grew as high as trees And the world, it stopped, it stopped for you and meI thought you'd come back!At least I prayed  So I prayed...The romance has been dead!The romance is dead, the romance is dead For years  You come back But I've been too afraid To dig the grave  So I prayed...Relief support never came!Memories carry me through the day of when we were kids And angels came to watch us play Close my eyes just for tonight!The sun still sleeps, and when she wakes!Close my eyes just for tonight!The sun still sleeps, and when she wakes!A movie that plays in my mind!Remembering you helps me survive!Every day, a rerun of the next!I promised to stay by your side!That all would change!I can't complain, another victim of the game Old familiar face, that bitter taste She's been hanging around too long That crooked tongue, so pale, so young Makes me warm Take me to the darkness, hang me out to dry Tangled in your legs, in the webs of your lies Lead me to the rapture, set my body free Higher than the flames, set ablaze inside of me, whoa There's no turning back, there's no coming down I'm forever lost, there's no coming down Oh, I'm skin and bones, pale as a ghost I know that I should be moving on But in your embrace, you know I'll never change Hopeless, I am chained down on my knees Take me to the darkness, hang me out to dry Tangled in your legs, in the webs of your lies Lead me to the rapture, set my body free Higher than the flames, set ablaze inside of me, whoa There's no turning back, there's no coming down I'm forever lost, there's no coming downI used to think I had it all Somehow I fell back into habits that tear me apart I never got to say I'm sorry But I can't sleep alone tonight If it's good for me and it's good for you If I die tonight then I'll make it up to you You're the only thing that gets me high And I hate it, and I hate it You're the only thing that gets me high And I hate it, and I hate it I'm tangled up in my own image But I hate who's staring back at me If it's the truth I seek It's the truth you'll serve If my soul is weak then I'll make it up to youTwelfth and Hide on a Sunday Feeling like we're gold And we're nothing short of invincible Invincible, invincible!It starts again, can you feel it It takes your breath away Stop saying that we're invincible, it's around and round You're uninviting, unrewarding And I'm misinforming you, misinforming you We all wanna be, wanna be somebody Right now, we're just looking for the exit This is the way I would have done things Up against the wall, up against the wall You got me up against your wall This is the way I  would have done things Up against the wall, up against the wall You got me up against your wall It's you and me on a Monday, the lies that we told This is where we both go numb now You broke my heart again this time You're fading now, you crossed the line You crossed the lineAnd I heard a voice through the discord of a deluge of passersby And I saw one gaze frozen in time watching me passing by And I swear I'll know your face in the crowd And I'll hear your voice so loud when you're whispering Hey, unfaithful, I will teach you To be stronger, to be stronger Hey, ungraceful, I will teach you To forgive one another Here's my kiss to betray Desperate to brush the lips of grace Do you feel hollow when you Think of how I've lied O sweet angel of mercy, with your grace like the morning Wrap your loving arms around me O sweet angel of mercy, with your grace like the morning Wrap your loving arms around me Hey, unfaithful, I will teach you To be stronger, to be stronger Hey, ungraceful, I will teach you To forgive one another Hey, unfaithful, I will teach you To be stronger, to be stronger Hey, unloving, I will love you I will love you, I will love you.. Like I said"Leave your baggage at the back door"I'm leaving you the way, I think it should be We're always Pulling into spaces that we can't back out of Starting fights we can't talk our way out of them Talk our way out of them Talk our way out of them How does it feel to be on the receiving end Of this one, of this one I'm halfway there and it's all on me This is what I get for wanting more, for wanting more This is the way it's got to be, dancing on all these changes So, I walk around with this rope in my hand, rope in my hand So, I'll tie it around and around And around, I'll tie me down I'll fantasize of being manic, and leaving us behind In your eyes, you were the one that tried Acceptance is what holds us here, and you, my dear, are the one I Fear tonight, we'll try just one more time
