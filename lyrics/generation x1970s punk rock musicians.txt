The Greyhound's rocking out tonight To maximum rockabilly When two punks chose to risk the subway For a tube to Piccadilly The Zephrys stir fast gangs for glory Another dumb casualty Having fun In South West six Hidden flick knife flicks Kiss me, deadly, tonight Another battle was won and lost Down The Bishops End last night Spotlights pick the kids in triumph With a thousand scarves in flight, see how they run Spring from the terraces in black and white Young and old into the fight Having fun In South West Six With violence for a fix Kiss me, deadly, tonight Seven o'clock they stand in rank For the thirty bus uptown And later in a downstairs room She pulls her lover down In ecstasy but they can't make a sound Case her mother might come down Having fun In South West Six Discovers teenage
