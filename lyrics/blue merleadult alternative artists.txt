I always knew that you do great things I didn't ever want to slow you down I was there when you learned to use your wings And I saw you leave the ground The time spent in your sweet arms Was the best time that I've known Maybe the reason I was here at all was to see you carry on Don't you know I still remember How once I was someone to you Girl you were meant for something better Doesn't matter anymore what you think of me I just proud to be part of your history I knew the time was coming soon You were growing up so fast Sometimes you could lose so much when you try to make it last I always knew that you do great things I didn't ever want to slow you down I was there when you learned to use your wings And I saw you leave the ground Don't you know I still remember How once I was someone to you Girl you were meant for something better Doesn't matter anymore what you think of me I just proud to be part of your history Doesn't matter anymore cause you set me free I just proud to be part of your historyFriday morning all alone One by one the stars each say goodbye Yeah pictures and a thousand words A thousand miles turning into song And I want you to know I feel lucky to know you Cut open my heart And you'll see that it's true I want you to know I feel lucky to know you I feel lucky to know you Yeah summer fades into fall And with it Came the writing on the wall So I sent a thousand letters on the Backs of silver angels through the sky And I want you to know I feel lucky to know you Cut open my heart And you'll see that it's true I want you to know I feel lucky to know you I feel lucky to know youWell, it looks like they're running on time And you can taste in my tears that I love you So kiss me again and then tell me goodbye Cause airports ain't nothing but places you cry They ain't nothing but places to cry And this bartender is selling a lie That all of these travelers are buying Cause everyone's looking for something to find But bars, they ain't nothing but places you hide They ain't nothing but places to hide Places do nothing but take me away from your side Now I'm stuck in this airport and trying to get back To the place that you helped me to find Cause airports are places I am when I am not by your side This city is covered in lights And everyone's out for the evening But no one here cares if you're dead or alive I guess cities ain't nothing but places to fly They ain't nothing but places to fly Places do nothing but take me away from your side Now I am stuck in this city and trying to get back To the place that you helped me to find Cause cities are places I am when I am not by your side Yeah, places are places I am when I am not where you areWell I had a girl, she was the best around And I was in love, now I'm just hangin out And I'm burning in the sun Losing my mind Hearts break in the summer time I'm burning in the sun And Losing my mind I thought I was a man; I was ready to die for her It wasn't part of the plan, what was I suppose to do Run, run, run I'm burning in the sun Losing my mind Hearts break in the summer time I'm burning in the sun And losing my mind I had a girl, she was the best around Ya, Ya It was it part of the plan, was I suppose to do Run, run, run I'm burning in the sun I'm losing my mind Hearts break in the summer time Ya I'm burning in the sun Losing my mindI can't seem to face up to the facts I'm tense and nervous and I can't relax I can't sleep, 'cause my bed's on fire Don't touch me, I'm a real live wire Psycho killer, qu'est-ce que c'est Fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, far better Run,

Oh-ho-ho-ho, aye-yi-yi-yi-yiHave you ever heard the sounds in the shadows of a song Have you ever felt the words blow right through from beyond Years pass, people change Blue skies could turn to grey Though it's gonna hurt for now, every ship must sail away Every ship must sail away Oh, change is in the air And you wear it oh so well I asked you if you cared If you care I couldn't tell'Cause years pass, people change Blue skies could turn to grey Though it's gonna hurt for now, every ship must sail away Every ship must sail away Though it's gonna hurt for now Every ship must sail away Well the morning was wrapped in a blanket of clouds I've been out driving since a quarter of two My body's aching, my feelings are numb From the bittersweet memory that's tangled in you The bittersweet memory all tangled in you There's cars that are cruising with nowhere to go And the rain in the streets makes them shine good as new Wish I could ride right out of this town And away from the memory that's tangled in you The bittersweet memory all tangled in you There's friends I go out with, friends that I know They leave the feels like there's nothing to do My best friend just packed up and left with her lover Left me alone with the memory of you Bittersweet memory all tangled in you So I'm packing my things and I'm moving back home This town ain't enough to cripple my soul Saying goodbye should be easy to do But the bittersweet memory is tangled in you A bittersweet memory's all tangled in you Well the morning was wrapped in a blanket of clouds I've been out driving since a quarter of twoToday I walked across the great divide And left you standing On the other side The things I loved in you were gone I'm seeing through you Monday night and here I am all alone Nothing you could say to me would Break my bones Your time has come and gone And vanished in the air I'm seeing through you I'm seeing through you I'm seeing through you I'm seeing through you And you are not the same It hurts my eyes to see the change I'm seeing through you I'm seeing through you Today I walked across the great divide And left you standing On the other side Your time has come and gone And vanished in the air I'm seeing through youI've been high and i've been low I've been wandering 'round the city of New Orleans Summer nights on crowded streets I've been tearing down the walls around my heart Fools cannot deny All the things you touch inside And like the daylight needs the sun Girl, you and me were made to run Left behind a trail of love in the shadows on the wall above your bed Nothing but a quarter moon and a halo making stars around your head Fools could not deny All the things you touch inside And like the daylight needs the sun Girl, you and me were made to run It's like the song that's in your head...It's like the song that's in your head...You are the song in my head that I find Was the song I was singing all along Driving fast, tracing lines in the dust around the memory of your love Far away, sleeping sound, waiting for my headlights in the driveIm walking the streets With my hands in my shoes Im out on a date with a picture of you I got a boxcar racer Its faster than the speed of sound It takes me away from here Shes walking the streets With her hands in her shoes And shes in love with a boy Who only gives her the blues She loves a boxcar racer because Hes faster than the speed of sound He takes her away from here And if you look oh if you look You'll find nothing at all You'll find nothing at all But if its good oh if its good You find a love a great lover If you let it go So now im walking the streets All alone in the night I take a look at myself And kiss you goodbye but why I was a boxcar racer who was driving so Fast that i couldn't slow down I was running away from here I was a boxcar racer who was driving so Fast that i couldn't slow down I was running away from here
