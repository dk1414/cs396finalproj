Hello, I've waited here for you Everlong Tonight, I throw myself into And out of the red, out of her head, she sang Come down, and waste away with me Down with me Slow, how you wanted it to be I'm over my head, out of her head, she sang And I wonder When I sing along with you If everything could ever feel this real forever If anything could ever be this good again The only thing I'll ever ask of you You gotta promise not to stop when I say when She sang Breathe out, so I can breathe you in Hold you in And now, I know you've always been Out of your head, out of my head, I sangToo alarmin' now to talk about Take your pictures down and shake it out Truth or consequence, say it aloud Use that evidence, race it around There goes my hero Watch him as he goes There goes my hero He's ordinary Don't the best of them bleed it out While the rest of them peter out Truth or consequence, say it aloud Use that evidence, race it around There goes my hero Watch him as he goes There goes my hero He's ordinary Kudos, my hero Leavin' all the mess You know my hero The one that's onKeep you in the dark, you know they all pretend Keep you in the dark and so it all began Send in your skeletons Sing as their bones go marching in again The need you buried deep The secrets that you keep are at the ready Are you ready I'm finished making sense Done pleading ignorance, that whole defense Spinning infinity, boy The wheel is spinning me, it's never ending, never ending Same old story What if I say I'm not like the others What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays You're the pretender What if I say I will never surrender What if I say I'm not like the others What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays You're the pretender What if I say that I'll never surrender All my life, I've been searchin' for somethin'Somethin' never comes, never leads to nothin'Nothin' satisfies, but I'm gettin' close Closer to the prize at the end of the rope All night long, I dream of the day When it comes around, then it's taken away Leaves me with the feelin' that I feel the most Feel it come to life when I see your ghost Come down, don't you resist You've such a delicate wrist And if I give it a twist Somethin' to hold when I lose my grip Will I find somethin' in there To give me just what I need Another reason to bleed One by one, hidden up my sleeve One by one, hidden up my sleeve Hey, don't let it go to waste I love it, but I hate the taste Weight keepin' me down Hey, don't let it go to waste I love it, but I hate the taste Weight keepin' me downI've got another confession to make I'm your fool Everyone's got their chains to break Holdin' you Were you born to resist Or be abused Is someone getting the best The best, the best, the best of you Is someone getting the best The best, the best, the best of you Are you gone and on to someone new I needed somewhere to hang my head Without your noose You gave me something that I didn't have But had no use I was too weak to give in Too strong to lose My heart is under arrest again But I break loose My head is giving me life or death But I can't choose I swear I'll never give in I refuseRun and tell all of the angels, this could take all night Think I need a devil to help me get things right Hook me up a new revolution, 'cause this one is a lie We sat around laughin' and watched the last one die Now I'm lookin' to the sky to save me, lookin' for a sign of life Lookin' for something to help me burn out bright I'm lookin' for a complication, lookin' 'cause I'm tired of lyin'Make my way back home when I learn to fly high I think I'm done nursin' the patience, it can wait one night I'd give it all away if you give me one last try We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life Run and tell the angels that everything's alright Now I'm lookin' to the sky to save me, I'm lookin' for a sign of life Lookin' for something to help me burn out bright I'm lookin' for a complication, lookin' 'cause I'm tired of tryin'Make my way back home when I learn to fly high Make my way back home when I learn to Fly along with me, I can't quite make it alone Try to make this life my own Fly along with me, I can't quite make it alone Try to make this life my ownThe sky is a neighborhood, so keep it down Heart is a storybook, a star burned out The sky is a neighborhood, don't make a sound Lights
