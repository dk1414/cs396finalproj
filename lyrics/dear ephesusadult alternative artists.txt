Ceiling turning Laughing loser Pleasure dying When the time to turn and walk away from yesterday, hey, hey, oh goodbye Sweater unraveling Moonscape drifting Sandwaves eclipsing And i have flown the morning glow The rested saints find fields below Barren lands behind me now Fallow ground tread forth new bounds And yesterself holds men in chains Oh when to walk from yesterself Oh when to walk from yesterday Oh to walk away Oh to walk awayPicnics in the park Long walks after dark Life begins with a smile The fragrance of a rose The falling of the snow Life begins with a smile The rain a sprinkling down Sundays on the town Life begins with a smile The death of someone close Poverty stricken folks Life took away my smile Rapers in the streets Oh there's murder every week Life destroyed my smile The rain is sprinklings down Sundays on the town Life begins with a smile Incest and child abuse The raging pains of drug abuse Where the heck is my smile Sheephishly hide away Flock torn wolves shaded gray Cloud luster sparkle fade Well spring dry feelings jade Consecrate splintered man Weakened stance falling down Eye sore flesh hate my crown I resolve now lay me down Sifting my ashes through Spackled stained red residue Cold freeze old winter heart Strings pulled tight i the harp Played my role in this tragic comedy Left with nothing but pictures and meaningless words So afraid of letting go, cool morning, frosted in snow Melody now the angels sing let the chorus ring Wisdom come to me and soothe me with your voice Water fall chasing down my lies Children cry The eyes of the Father are raining on my soul Enchanted by the dance, eyes say i am Mask noble chivalry Run woodland revelry Cast lots gain no advance Come now sweet divine romanceThe holidays Brother laughs Grandma's cooking Mom and dad It used to be So carefree Now we've become Divided family And now it's christmas Gather round the tree Something's missing Is it only me The stockings hung But i don't care There seems to be An empty chair The food looks great But i can't eat It bothers me I think i'll cry Where can a young boy hide It seems so very far away The tree must come down But must the house fall too I wish that i had realized i could run to youShe's a princess in her name alone And how her beauty exceeds the moon A breath of life when she fills his space But he don't notice he's been so consumed He truly loves her They're a portrait of grace in many shades And he's growing learning more each day You know she loves him in spite of all his ways They're a portrait of grace in many shades Sense the water rain aloud Fire covers burns the house for love Ears that hear know for what to wait A timeless picture suspended in grace He truly loves her His secret heart comes out at night Vessel torn down oh beauty bright Silence hears her cry He longs for light She is alone But he is coming home Love has endured A protrait of His hand Kindle the heart A walk eternalShifting as I lie beside you Warmed by all the love that moves you I wish I was some wonderful guy Left alone with no great honor Drinking in my tears like wine No carriage for this ride it's midnight Running through lush fields in my dreams Returning home for love has brought me Held in your arms I am yours Hey girl, sad face I'm sorry that I hurt you I just haven't been myself in days Talking down the flags that carry Things of days misused in waving I see your eyes they're longing for the truth Sitting in this room we're talking Conversation flows so freely Can't believe I've been so blind Running through lush fields in my dreams Returning home for love has brought me Held in your arms I am yours Hey girl sad face I'm sorry that I hurt you I just haven't been myself in days Hey boy sad face The rain still showers gently I know you haven't been yourself in days Woe blame upon my head Fostered what's not mine But how you love me wakes my eyes Woe we should be as one Together in our waltz And I could wear my favorite suit Woe I thought I'd lost you love But when I wake you're there So let me take you out for breakfastStrange world so odd how he sees it Pinwheel dreams chase the clouds Does he belong far away oh no Hey now do you see him as he flys his kite Can you relate as he skips away from you I thought you might see something in the way he laughed Don't you feel used nothing's a speck that's in your view Flag down thoughts from the cradle he feels Happy still when in dark endless wells Dreamer full of the joy he has found Oh, fly awayNo sounds yet echoes in the room Loud voices telling lies to their own truth Here's something for you to write down in your journal Here's nothing for you to write down in your journal Carry on you're a deaf man you can never believe just what you hear Carry on you're a blind man you can never believe just what you see Am I a documentary I must be a documentary Fly fishing across the rivers of Colorado Say mother do you think that I'm a man yet Say father do you think that I'm a manWalking down a country road Picking up a pebble and throw You're finally moving Basketball killed your sentiment I'll race you there and say I never went Bigger than what it wanted to be Those pebbles sure could help things seem Like you're finally moving Fireflies always bring a smile But you're gifted it's an honor child Potential to run the fastest mile But you're tired of running fast so you'd rather walk Open up a box of cracker jacks You know that toy surprise has really made your day Yeah you opened up a box of cracker jacks Thank you my very simple boy Yes I've seen you fly your kite and now I'm walking too For all the boys For all the girls Simple's walking awayBeauty frogs and princes dance as one These words are further from the truth than ignorant Boxers squaring off in manly fervor To think the last one standing gains the bone Brush fires small amounts of ash to occupy Firemen ringing bells it's Pavlov's dogs In the lighthouse seamen warn the misty waters Jesus a word that scared but made you thinking Somebody fell I heard the sound of the trees crying in the forest Somebody died a step away from you Somebody walked into the face of a world that they never wanted And nobody thinks that this is even a clue Wall street chutes and ladders gain your favor My world is juggling with this cosmic line-up Sounds like desperate clinging must control freak Answer pick up on line mass technology I'm singing I'm dancing I'm laughing I'm happy
