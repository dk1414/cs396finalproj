And it starts sometime around midnight Or at least that's when you lose yourself for a minute or two As you stand under the bar lights And the band plays some song About forgetting yourself for a while And the piano's this melancholy soundtrack to her smile And that white dress she's wearing You haven't seen her for a while But you know that she's watching She's laughing, she's turning She's holding her tonic like a crux The room's suddenly spinning She walks up and asks how you are So you can smell her perfume You can see her lying naked in your arms And so there's a change in your emotions And all these memories come rushing Like feral waves to your mind Of the curl of your bodies like two perfect circles entwined And you feel hopeless and homeless And lost in the haze of the wine Then she leaves with someone you don't know But she makes sure you saw her She looks right at you and bolts As she walks out the door Your blood boiling, your stomach in ropes Oh, and your friends say "What is it You look like you've seen a ghost"I can only say these things to you while you’re sleeping I hear the hum from the wires, the sounds of the morning creeping I lie awake and pretend you can hear me You tell me that you’re scared that you’re turning into your mother I feel myself turning into my father We could lie to each other like they do and say we’re so happy It’s easy when you’re young and you still want it so badly And I feel my heart pounding And I think I might scream...I can tell you that you’re all I’ve ever wanted, dear I can utter every word you’ve ever hoped to hear I shudder when I think that I might not be here forever, forever, forever In the night you whisper like a ghost and you look so shaken You're so quiet and small and you tell me you want to be taken I just never think of you as the kind of girl who would say that And you suddenly seem like some faceless thing in my grasp Your eyes alight, your face aglow It's the face of someone I don't know I can tell that you’re all I’ve ever wanted, dear I can utter every word you’ve ever hoped to hear I shudder when I think I might not be here forever, forever, foreverAll these buckets of rain I've heard enough about You say that I lie I am a gentleman Didn't I ask for a place I could stay What were we both thinking The next part just got in the way You were just always talking about changing, changing What if I was the same man, same man The same I always was All these things that you say Like I'll forget about The mind-numbing games that you play I am a gentleman Didn't I pay for every laugh every dime Every bit every time And then you feed me some lie I won't hear one more word about changing, changing Guess what I am the same man, same man Same man I've always beenFive, six, seven, eight!All the time away You're still on my mind But we were on our own Almost all the time And she'll step away For a second or two And I close my eyes And I think of you We were only seventeen We were holding in our screams Like we'd torn it from the pages of some lipstick magazine And you scratch and turn and say, "Let's burn ourselves up 'til we scream"Like gasoline Oh those tender days At your mother's house And your father would find my hand inside your blouse Well, they tell me that You're married now Oh my dear, I fear I can't understand howEvery night I’m lying here The world crashing through my ears I always hear the same damn thing:“You can’t live your life hanging on a string.”He’s always saying“Stop complaining  You really can’t ever expect too much Boy, you were born with the common touch.”And we fall and fall and fall and fall With our heads soaked up in alcohol One hand on a cigarette, I swear I still got some good moves left I’ve been fifty-eight since I was twenty-three I got sixty-nine problems but one ain’t me And seriously I don’t give a fuck if my answer isn’t good enough Hey, there, tell me man, what’s the answer to this riddle then Is it heroin Or Jesus Christ Big-ass books Or sleepless nights I had a few of those and everyone knows That the common touch ain’t worth the priceBlack lungs, headlights Heading off to the city tonight Out the front door, turn right I was alone, alright alright alright I wonder what they’ll think of me I’ll run away, run away This is my town, this is my night Heading off to the city tonight And she said, “Come on, out with it  Come on, out with it.”“Come on, out with it  Come on, out with it.”“Come on, out with it  Come on, out with it.”“Come on, out with it  Come on, out with it.”Hard words on a hot night“I’ll have a beer, won’t you turn out the light ”From the front door I could hear it right I’m just running dumb and dumb and dumb and dumb I wonder if I’ll be turning back I got twenty bucks in a pocket with my stash I’m not afraid I’m not your “good night”I’m just a shadow of a shadow tonight And she said, “Come on, out with it  Come on, out with it.”Come on, out with it  Come on outTheres a distance in your eyes That's why a smile is always such a surprise When you call and you talk to me I wonder which person you're gonna be She said "All your songs are sad songs Why do you always have to see the worst of it Could you write me just one love song Put my name somewhere in the middle of it It's not hard to rhyme Elizabeth Just close your eyes boy and take your best guess Cause the truth is hard, isn't it "She said "I'll be listening in my favorite white dress."All these quiet afternoons She said "I wonder if I've given up my love too soon."As her hair fell from her curls I said, "You're pretty uptight for a Mexican girl."She said "All your songs are sad songs Why do you always have to make me feel like shit Could you write me just one love song And put my name somewhere in the middle of it And if you called the song Elizabeth All my friends will know that it's about me Cause the truth is hard, isnt' it But don't take too long cause I know you'll come back to me."Standing on a bus stop Feeling your head pop Out in the night In the kind of night Where you want to be out On the street, on the street Crawling up the walls Like a cat in heat And the air is thin And it blows through your skin And you feel like something Is about to begin But you don't know what And you don't know when So you tear at your hair And you scratch at your skin You wanna run away, run away Just get on the fucking train and leave today And it doesn't matter where you spend the night You just might end up somewhere in a fight, in a fight Or calling your room on a concrete shelf Fighting all alone, with yourself, with yourself And you just wanna feel like a coin that's been tossed In a wishing well, a wishing well A wishing well, a wishing well Well you're tossed in the air And you fell and you fell Through the dark blue waters Where you cast your spell Like you were just a wish that could turn out wellOh and God just leave that Abraham alone He wants a son, he wants a son Everybody wants a home Though I'm not quite sure if poor Isaac would agree"My God," he said, "What did I do To make you wanna watch me bleed "And I feel sick tonight, I feel just like The dancing flame on a funeral light And I'm not sure if I want you to save me And I'd be less uptight if I knew the sight Of blood was just a weakness And not the whole reason that you made me But sometimes I think it is...Oh and God just go and leave me all alone I'm not your son, I'm not your son Everybody dies alone Was this world not quite hard enough for you I guess like anyone, you've got Your own scores to settle too And I'm so pissed tonight, I feel just like The last remainin' Canaanite And I don't think that I will be returning And if you wanna see the irony And the savage price of piety There’s a lot of us who are going to be burning How does it feel The thing about dreams Is that everything seems Like you're riding a wave It's been forming all day in your mind The thing about time It's all in your mind Days turn to weeks turn to years turn to infinite signs What you're leavin' behind And the hell with the rest You gave them your best You talk through your teeth And the black cigarettes In your hand I've always believed You were more than impossible More than you seem And hardly responsible for my life For my eyes Let's stay the night We'll leave with the sunrise The thing about me Is I wanted to be More than just friends And hardly acquaintances I, I wanna know why
