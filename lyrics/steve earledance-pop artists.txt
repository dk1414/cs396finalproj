Well, my name's John Lee Pettimore Same as my Daddy and his Daddy before You hardly ever saw Grandaddy down here He only come to town about twice a year He'd buy a hundred pounds of yeast and some copper line Everybody knew that he made moonshine Now, the Revenue man wanted Grandaddy bad Headed up the holler with everything he had Before my time, but I've been told He never come back from Copperhead Road Now, Daddy ran the whiskey in a big block Dodge Bought it at an auction at the Mason's Lodge"Johnson County Sheriff" painted on the side He just shot a coat of primer, then he looked inside Well, him and my uncle tore that engine down I still remember that rumblin' sound And then the Sheriff came around in the middle of the night Heard Mama cryin', knew something wasn't right He was headed down to Knoxville with the weekly load You could smell the whiskey burnin' down Copperhead Road Hey!Hey  Hey Hey pretty baby, are you ready for me Yeah it's your good rocking daddy down from Tennessee I'm just out of Austin, bound for San Antone With the radio blasting and the bird dog on There's a speed trap up ahead in Selma Town But no local yokel gonna shut me down Because me and my boys got this rig unwound And we've come a thousand miles from a Guitar Town Nothing ever happened around my hometown And I ain't the kind to just hang around But I heard someone calling my name one day And I followed that voice down the lost highway Everybody told me you can't get far On thirty-seven dollars and a Jap guitar Now I'm smokin' into Texas with the hammer down And a rocking little combo from the Guitar Town Hey pretty baby, don't you know it ain't my fault I love to hear the steel belts humming on the asphalt Wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop Stumble in the restaurant wondering why I don't stop Well I got to keep rocking while I still can I got a two pack habit and a motel tan When my boots hit the boards, I'm a brand new man With my back to the riser, I make my stand Hey pretty baby, won't you hold me tight I'm loading up and rolling out of here tonight One of these days I'm gonna settle down And take you back with me to the Guitar TownWell, I took a stroll on the old long walk Of a day-i-ay-i-ay I met a little girl and we stopped to talk Of a fine soft day-i-ay And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do Because her hair was black and her eyes were blue And I knew right then, I'd be taking a whirl Around the Salthill prom with a Galway girl We were halfway there when the rain came down Of a day-i-ay-i-ay She asked me up to her flat downtown Of a fine soft day-i-ay And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do Because her hair was black and her eyes were blue I took her hand and I give her a twirl And I lost my heart to a Galway girl When I woke up, I was all alone With a broken heart and a ticket home And I ask you now, tell me what would you do If her hair was black and her eyes were blue'Cause I've traveled around, I've been all over this world Boys, I ain't never seen nothing like a Galway girlI was born on this mountain a long time ago Before they knocked down the timber and strip-mined the coal When you rose in the mornin' before it was light To go down in that dark hole and come back up at night I was born on this mountain, this mountain's my home She holds me and keeps me from worry and woe Well, they took everything that she gave, now they're gone But I'll die on this mountain, this mountain's my home I was young on this mountain but now I am old And I knew every holler, every cool swimmin' holeâ€˜Til one night I lay down and woke up to find That my childhood was over and I went down in the mine There's a hole in this mountain and it's dark and it's deep And God only knows all the secrets it keeps There's a chill in the air only miners can feel There're ghosts in the tunnels that the company sealedI'm an American, boys I've come a long way I was born and bred in the U SA So listen up close I've got somethin' to say Boys, I'm buying this round Well it took a little while, but we're in this fight And we ain't going home until we've done what's right We're going to drink Camden Town dry tonight If I have to spend my last pound When I first got to London it was pouring down rain Met a little girl in the field canteen Painted her name on the nose of my plane Six more missions, I'm gone Well I asked if I could stay and she said that I might Then the warden came around yelling "shut out the lights"Death raining out of the London night We made love 'til dawnAnother year has come and gone Another circle around the sun Another thousand tears have fallen I don't ever count 'em 'cause I'm surrounded by your love And days are never long enough Four more seasons on parade Show their colors then they fade But that won't happen to us, darling We'll remember how it was Then begin again because Days are never long enough Time's never late, isn't bound by our fate Try as we may, love might never be found, if we wait Until the sun comes up on another day, my love Days are never long enough Time's never late, isn't bound by our fate Try as we may, love might never be found, if we wait Until the sun comes up on another day, my love Days are never long enoughSo you wanna be an outlaw  Better take it from me Living on the highway ain't everything it's supposed to be Everybody reckons that they wanna be free Ain't nobody wants to be alone Stumblin' in the alley at a quarter to three Hollering after Sally, "Honey, what you trying to do to me "Told me, "Go to hell, I'm going back to Tennessee"I said, "Angel, you can never go home"Never go home Never go home If you wanna be an outlaw You can never go home So you wanna be outlaw  Better listen up, kid Steal a million dollars and you have to keep it hid Ain't no place to spend it in the desert if you did And you can't take it with you when you go Always something laying for you up around the bend Everything that goes around comes back around again You can't trust anybody, not a lover or a friend Your momma, maybe, then you never knowI was born my papa's son A wandering eye and a smoking gun Now some of you would live through me Then lock me up and throw away the key Or just find a place to hide away And hope that I just go away That I feel alright, I feel alright tonight I feel alright, I feel alright tonight I'll bring you precious contraband And ancient tales from distant lands Of conquerors and concubines And conjurers from darker times Betrayal and conspiracy Sacrilege and heresy That I feel alright, I feel alright tonight I feel alright, I feel alright tonight I got everything you won't need Your darkest fear, your fondest dream I ask you questions, tell you lies Criticize and sympathize Yeah but be careful what you wish for, friend Because I've been to hell and now I'm back againAbout the time that Daddy left to fight the big war I saw my first pistol in the general store In the general store when I was thirteen Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen I asked if I could have one someday when I grew up Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up She really blew up, I didn't understand Mama said, "The pistol is the devil's right hand"The devil's right hand The devil's right hand Mama said, "The pistol is the devil's right hand"My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt Shoot as fast as lightning but she loads a mite slow Loads a mite slow and soon I found out It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45 Called a Peacemaker, but I never knew why Never knew why, I didn't understand Mama said, "The pistol is the devil's right hand"There ain't a lot that you can do in this town You drive down to the lake and then you turn back around You go to school and you learn to read and write So you can walk into the county bank and sign away your life Now I work at the filling station on the interstate I'm pumping gasoline and counting out-of-state plates They ask me, "How far into Memphis, son, and where's the nearest beer "And they don't even know that there's a town around here Someday I'm finally going to let go Because I know there's a better way And I want to know what's over that rainbow I'm going to get out of here someday, someday Now my brother went to college because he played football But I'm still hanging round 'cause I'm a little bit small But I got me a '67 Chevy, she's low and sleek and black Someday I'll put her on that interstate and never look back Someday I'm finally going to let go Because I know there's a better way And I want to know what's over that rainbow I'm going to get out of here someday, someday
