When I came to an end Where was God When I lost my mind Where was God When I couldn't find I don't wanna be up or down Don't wanna be up or down Don't wanna be up or down I don't wanna be up or down Where was love When I felt like hate Where was hate When I felt like love Where were you When you said you'd be there Where was the fear When I said I was scared Do you see me sittin' here Waitin' for you to say anything Head hung low, kickin' stones down Kickin' stones down the road to hell now I'm waitin' for you to say anything Oh, anything, yeah I know you are the only one A little taste of heaven And you know I am the only one Your bitter taste of hell Your eyes scream, "The end is creeping in I'll need 37 stitches to keep the pain in"And I know you are the only one On the darkest side of the sun On the darkest side of the sun Ooh, yeah Followed the piper's sweet whistlin'Guided down the path by the wrong hand Closed my eyes for the chance of a better view Closed my ears so I couldn't hear youI will sit right here and bide my time As long as it takes, to get what's rightfully mine And I won't be denied And all I got left is my pride And I will rise up Breaking out, break you down Break the rules, break new ground Had your chance, now it's gone A new day, a new dawn I will sit right here and I will wait Patiently for your last big mistake And I won't be denied And all I got left is my pride And I will rise up Breaking out, break you down Break the rules, break new ground Had your chance, now it's gone A new day, a new dawn I control my own fate Now, for you, it's too late It's my dream, it's my way It's my life, it's your pain  Oh, no Shouldn't have that far to go The less you think, the more you know It seems the dream is impossible It seems the dream is impossible It seems the dream is impossible Never made a difference, so why should you Promise me you won't look at me!There's nothing left here to talk about There's nothing left here to talk about There's nothing left here to talk about There's nothing left There's nothing left here to talk about There's nothing left here to talk about There's nothing left here to talk about There's nothing left No matter how hard I try The lonely one refuses to die
