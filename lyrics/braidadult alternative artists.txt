It's not like I'm feeling much different Than a woman my age years ago Liberated is what you wanna call it How about unfairly choked Cause I know some just see my body And every girl I know at some point stopped eating I'm not a man hater I enjoy them like cake But in my position I'm the slut I'm the bitch I'm the whore The one you hate And there’s a name for this kind of man A soft one at that Womanizer Casanova Lothario For us it’s just a stamp to the head For them another notch in the bed It’s like I’m wearing red, and if I am You feel you’ve the right to touch me Cause I asked for it In my little mini skirt Think you can have it My little mini skirt It’s mine all mine I know what it’s like To have everything Taken away from me and my family For there was once a man Proposing to love all of us Instead he is full of hate Towards himself, towards his bait And everything he touches is for him My mother’s soul he devours with a grin And when she finds out The child he has taken Confronts him Stakes him Breaks him All our boxes on the lawn Woman shelter for 9 months Cross the street to the church Pray confusedly about what hurts Enough to start A new beginning for us both I thank you Canada Thank you CanadaTake me by the hand Will you guide me through this phase Of not really knowing where I am Or knowing who I am I could think of it as I gave all my best in loving you But I know it’s not true It’s just my way of getting through We experience the love that we think we deserve And I guess I thought I didn’t need much from this world So I left you But you’re exactly what I like I will give you my whole life Mmmm you taste so nice Oh this feels so right Take me by the throat Will you push me up against this wall And spit all your hurt on me So I can feel my reach I have these dreams Of you laying it on meA dozen roses in the car And I don't know where you are Maybe I don't know what I'm doing You're moving like a movie You still move me Among the other ones And twos and threes and twenty-threes Got to keep my conscience clean But that hurricane what's-her-name Mentality was not for me And never could be Cause it surely brings bitter things And misery And I say Heaven hits me hard In with the new Heaven hits me hardly In with the news Whatever gets me started In with the noose Have you ever had a heaven here And was it clear Cause I just wrote a letter A confession down the ladder That things could be so much better Through follow the leader I met her and then another end And usually a grudge But I loved so much The way we touched and psuedo-kissed Oh I already miss you singing like this Over the phone Every now and every then I tend to pretend I'm not aloneIt's not like I'm feeling much different Than a woman my age years ago Liberated is what you wanna call it How about unfairly choked Cause I know some just see my body And every girl I know at some point stopped eating I'm not a man hater I enjoy them like cake But in my position I'm the
