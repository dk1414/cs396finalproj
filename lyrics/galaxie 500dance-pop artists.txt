shame How we break each other's hearts And cause each other pain How we take each other's love Without thinking anymore Forgetting to give back Isn't it a pity Some things take so long And how do I explain But not too many people Can see we're all the same And because of all their tears Their eyes can't hope to see Beauty that surrounds them Oh, isn't it a pity Isn't it a pity Isn't it a shame How we break each other's hearts And cause each other pain How we take each other's love Without thinking anymore Forgetting to give back Isn't it a pity Thinking of blue thunder Singing to myself Thinking how fast it moves Feeling how it turns I was singing something Out on Route 128 Thinking how blue it looks Singing out aloud My, my blue thunder My, my blue thunder My, my blue thunder Singing out aloud Ah, la La, la La, la My, my blue thunder My, my blue thunder My, my blue thunder Singing out aloudThis is why events unnerve me Find it all, a different story All the time the wheels are turning Turn again and turn towards this time All she ask's the strength to hold me Then again the same old story Word will travel, oh so quickly Travel first and turn towards this time I'll hurt them all, no mercy shown Heaven knows, it's got to be this time Watching her, these things she said Times she cried And fail to wake this time I'll break them down, no mercy shown Heaven knows, it's got to be this time Avenues all lined with trees Picture me and then you start watching Avenues all lined with trees Picture me and then you start watching Avenues all lined with trees Picture me and then you start watchingWhen, when will you come home Watchin' T V all alone Watchin' Kojak on my own Staring at the wall And waiting for your call When, when will you come home Oh, oh-oh Now, I'm crawlin' on the floor Makin' noises like a dog Makin' noises you can't hear Staring at the wall And waiting for your call When, when will you come home Oh, oh-oh-ohI need to walk by the flowers with someone who could share my face Looks like nobody could take your place And I could bleed in sympathy with you On those days And I could drink up everything you have Don't let it go to waste I could show you memories to rival Berlin in the thirties I understand your dating-bar ways And I could bleed in sympathy with you On those days And I could drink up everything you have Don't let it go to waste Say something warm, say something nice I can't stand to see you when you're cold Nor can I stand being out of your life And I could bleed in sympathy with you On those days And I could drink up everything you haveWhy close your eyes To the sky today Why do you cry today Just because the sky is gray 'Cause it's okay if everyday Is not the same way It's just another way That everyday is not the same How can you see the sky When you close your eyes How can you run away Just because the sky is gray 'Cause it's okay if everyday Is not the same way It's just another way That everyday is not the same Na na na na na na Na na na na na na Na na na na na na Na na na na na naWell I listen to the weather And he's changed his tone of voice And he can see it on the radar Only seven hours away Well there's gonna be a snowstorm When the T V's goin' out And they got nothin' else to think of And they're letting me go home Well I'm lookin at the snowflakes And they all look the same And the clouds are goin by me They're playin some kind of game Well you know there's a snowstorm When the T V has gone out And they got nothin' else to think of And they're letting me go homeMy toes can talk And they're smiling at me"Come down," they say Not afraid anymore And they talk to me And they smile at me I walked upstream And I sat in the mud Life starts again Watching trees decompose And they talk to me And they smile at me
