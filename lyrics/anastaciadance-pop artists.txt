All my life I've been waiting For you to bring a fairy tale my way Been living in a fantasy without meaning It's not okay I don't feel safe, I don't feel safe Left broken, empty and in despair Wanna breathe, can't find air Thought you were sent from up above But you and me never had love So much more I have to say Help me find a way And I wonder if you know how it really feels To be left outside alone when it's cold out here Well, maybe you should know just how it feels To be left outside alone To be left outside alone I tell you, all my life I've been waiting For you to bring a fairy tale my way Been living in a fantasy without meaning It's not okay, I don't feel safe I need to prayNow, baby, come on Don't claim that love you never let me feel I should have known'Cause you brought nothing real Come on, be a man about it, you won't die I ain't got no more tears to cry And I can't take this no more You know I gotta let it go And you know I'm outta love, set me free And let me out this misery Just show me the way to get my life again'Cause you can't handle me Said I'm outta love, can't you see Baby, that you gotta set me free I'm outta love Said how many times Have I tried to turn this love around But every time you just let me down Come on, be a man about it, you'll survive True that you can work it out all right Tell me, yesterday did you know I'd be the one to let you go And you knowMy love is on the line, my love is on the line My love is on the line, my love is on the line My love is on the line My love is on the line A little late for all the things you didn't say I'm not sad for you But I'm sad for all the time I had to waste'Cause I learned the truth Your heart is in a place I no longer wanna be I knew there'd come a day I'd set you free'Cause I'm sick and tired of always being sick and tired Your love isn't fair You live in a world where you didn't listen And you didn't care So I'm floating, I'm floating on airYou can say what you want about me Try to do what you want to me But you cannot stop me I've been knocked down, it's a crazy town Even got punched in the face in L.A Ain't nothing in the world That you keep me from doing what I wanna do'Cause I'm too proud, I'm too strong Live by the code that you gotta move on Feeling sorry for yourself ain't got nobody nowhere so I...Held my head high knew I'd survive I made it Don't hate it That's just the way it goes I done made it through Stand on my own too I paid my dues, yeah Tried to hold me down You can't stop me now I paid my duesI know that's just the way it goes And you ain't right, for sure You turned your back on love For the last time It won't take much longer now Time makes me stronger Well, there's nothing more to say One day in your life Said love will remind you How could you leave it all behind One day in your life it's gonna find you With the tears you let me cry And baby, I'm stronger than before You've gotta lay it on the line Maybe one day in your life My love, did you think I'd break down and cry This thing we had, it meant the world to me Guess I was blindWe've been rolling like thunder Ain't been no other Got my back the way you do babe And every day it gets stronger The way that I want you I can't push it away And everyday I'm trying to find the words, the words to say I'm trying not to complicate the games we play And I don't know how or when but things have got to change Now my heart sings out so loud Boy, I need you now I need you now Oh you, you got me caught in the middle You got me caught in the middle With you, my heart and my head oh I don't

thatAll the time that we spend together I won't fuss, I won't fight Tryin' to make you mine You know I'm not that kind, c'mon I said I'll love you 'til the 12th of never But I won't run far ahead Leaving you behind You know I'm not that kind'Cause I'm not that kind of girl And it's not my kind of world No, it's not for me Not where I wanna be Help me out, tell me what you're thinkin'If I rush, slow me down You can take your time You know I'm not that kind If you leave, I believe life will go on The wind will blow, water flow And the sun will shine, yeah, it will You know I'm not that kindWhy'd you lie to me You can't be trusted good for nothin' type of brother Everything you claim to be was a lie...lie Why'd you lie to me You'd been creeping, sneaking, sleeping with another Messed up it's time to leave so bye...bye You used to treat me like a queen Said I was your everything Promised me that you would never cheat on me But I found a number on the floor And I won't take it no more Made me feel so crazy Thinking you'd be true to me yeah Did you really think that I turn the other cheek and I thought you were different But you're like the rest It's true!Why'd you lie to me You can't be trusted good for nothin' type of brother Everything you claim to be was a lie...lie Why'd you lie to me You'd been creeping, sneaking, sleeping with another Messed up it's time to leave so bye...byeThe world is changing And time is spinning fast It's so amazing how you came into my life I know it seems all hope is gone I know you feel you can't be strong And once again the story ends with you and I And anytime you feel like you just can't go on Just hold on to my love And you'll never be alone Hold on, we can make it through the fire And my love, I'm forever by your side And you know, if you should ever call my name I'll be right there, you'll never be alone Hopeless to describe The way I feel for you No matter how I try Words would never do I looked into your eyes to find As long as love is alive There ain't nothing we can't make it throughStuck on the wrong side of heaven But I did it to myself, I did it to myself Traded in my forever But I did it to myself, I did it to myself When I get too close to my someday Every time I blow it away Praying I will come to my senses Won't be my own worst enemy And I put my heart back together Yeah, I put my heart back together Now I know what love is worth in a broken world But I can't get past the hurt'Til I give up on these stupid little things I'm so hung up on these stupid little things That keep me from you Treated love like a bad religion Yeah, I did it to myself, I did it to myself But I won't stay here unforgiven When I did it to myself, I did it to myself
