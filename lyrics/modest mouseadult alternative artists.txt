I backed my car into a cop car the other day Well, he just drove off, sometimes life's okay I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh, what did I say Well, you just laughed it off, it was all okay And we'll all float on, okay And we'll all float on, okay And we'll all float on, okay And we'll all float on anyway, well A fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam It was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand Bad news comes, don't you worry even when it lands Good news will work its way to all them plans We both got fired on exactly the same day Well, we'll float on, good news is on the way Bring it on, here we are, win or lose, win or lose Win or lose, win or lose, win or lose, win or lose Win or lose, win or lose, I can't say And we'll all float on, okay And we'll all float on, okay And we'll all float on, okay And we'll all float on, alrightEverything that keeps me together is falling apart I got this thing that I consider my only art Of fucking people over My boss just quit the job Says he's going out to find blind spots And he'll do it The third planet is sure that they're being watched By an eye in the sky that can't be stopped When you get to the promised land You're gonna shake the eye's hand Your heart felt good It was drippin' pitch and made of wood And your hands and knees Felt cold and wet on the grass beneath Well, outside, naked, shivering, looking blue From the cold sunlight that's reflecting off the moon And baby cum angels, fly around you Reminding you we used to be three and not just two And that's how the world began And that's how the world will endIce age heat wave, can't complain If the world's at large, why should I remain Walked away to another plan Gonna find another place, maybe one I can stand I move on to another day To a whole new town with a whole new way Went to the porch to have a thought Got to the door, and again, I couldn't stop You don't know where and you don't know when But you've still got your words and you've got your friends Walk along to another day Work a little harder, work another way Well uh-uh, baby, I ain't got no plan Well I float on, maybe would you understand Gonna float on, maybe would you understand Well I float on, maybe would you understand The days get shorter and the nights get cold I like the autumn but this place is getting old I pack up my belongings and I head for the coast It might not be a lot, but I feel like I'm making the most The days get longer and the nights smell green I guess it's not surprising, but it's spring and I should leave I like songs about drifters, books about the same They both seem to make me feel a little less insane Walked on off to another spot I still haven't gotten anywhere that I want Did I want love  Did I need to know Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow Travelling, swallowing Dramamine Feeling spaced, breathing out Listerine I'd said what I'd said, that I'd tell ya And that you'd killed the better part of me If you could just milk it for everything I've said what I'd said, and you know what I mean But I still can't focus on anything We kiss on the mouth but still cough down our sleeves Travelling, swallowing Dramamine Look at your face like you're killed in a dream And you think you've figured out everything I think I know my geography pretty damn well You say what you need so you'll get more If you could just milk it for everything I've said what I said, and you know what I mean But I still can't focus on anythingWoke up this morning, and it seemed to me That every night turns out to be A little bit more like Bukowski And yeah, I know he's a pretty good read But God, who'd wanna be God, who'd wanna be such an asshole God, who'd wanna be God, who'd wanna be such an asshole Well, we sat on the edge of the river The crowd screamed, "Sacrifice the liver!"If God takes life, he's an Indian giver So tell me now why, you'll tell me never Who would wanna be Who would wanna be such a control freak Well, who would wanna be Who would wanna be such a control freak Well, see what you want to see You should see it all Well, take what you want from me You deserve it all Nine times out of ten Our hearts just get dissolved Well, I want a better place Or just a better way to fall But one time out of ten Everything goes perfect for us all Well, I want a better place Or just a better way to fall Here we goYour body may be gone, I'm gonna carry you in In my head, in my heart, in my soul And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both live again Well, I don't know, I don't know I don't know, don't think so Well, that is that and this is this You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get You get away from me, you get away from me Collected my belongings and I left the jail Well, thanks for the time, I needed to think a spell I had to think awhile, I had to think awhile The ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in In your head, in your mouth, in your soul And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both grow old Well I don't know, I don't know I don't know, I hope so Well, that is that and this is this You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get You get away from me, you get away from me Collected my belongings and I left the jail Well, thanks for the time, I needed to think a spell I had to think awhile, I had to think awhileSometimes all I really want to feel is loved Sometimes I'm angry that I feel so angry Sometimes my feelings get in the way Of what I really feel I needed to say If you stand in a circle Then you'll all have a back to bite Backlogged books on the seven wonders We're all so funny; fun's lost it's charm Now all communications end in one-lined jokes Of stand-up comics and rock musicians Makin' so much noise you don't know when to listen Why are you judgin' people so damn hard You're taking your point-of-views a bit too far I made my shoes shine with black coal But the polish didn't shine the hole If you stand in a circle Then you'll all have a back to bite Backlogged books on the seven wonders We're all so funny; fun's lost it's charm Now all communications end in one-lined jokes From stand-up comics and rock musicians Makin' so much noise you don't know when to listenFrom the top of the ocean, yeah From the bottom of the sky, goddamn Well, I get claustrophobic I can, you know that I can, well From the top of the ocean, yeah From the bottom of the sky, goddamn Well, I get claustrophobic I can, you know that I can And he said"I am not allowed much danger Keep in line, you're an old friend, stranger You'll burn me in effigy and I'll burn you in effigy"Well, a rattlesnake up in Buffalo, Montana He bit the leg of the old sheriff Ha, that boy fell down on his harelipâ€”Oh, oh Well I, I might be wrong But you, you tag along And we, we've all been wronged And I feel dizzier by the mile Said, "Hell yeah, the money's spent"Went to the county line and paid the rent I said, "Uh-oh", I said "Uh-oh"Eating snowflakes with plastic forks And a paper plate, of course You think of everything Short love with a long divorce And a couple of kids, of course They don't mean anything Live in trailers with no class Goddamn, I hope I can pass High school means nothing Taking heartache with hard work Goddamn, I am such a jerk I can't do anything And I shout that you're all fakes And you should've seen the look on your face And I guess that's what it takes When comparing your bellyaches And it's been a long time Which agrees with this watch of mine And I know that I miss you And I'm sorry if I dissed you Eating snowflakes with plastic forks And a paper plate, of course You think of everything Short love with a long divorce And a couple of kids, of course They don't mean anything

mine It's a bad thought I'm on my way to God don't know My brain's the burger and my heart's the coal I'm trying to get my head clear I push things out through my mouth, I get refilled through my ears I get refilled through my ears I get refilled through my ears I'm on my way to God don't know or don't care My brain's the weak heart and my heart's the long stairs My heart's the long stairs My heart's the long stairs Inland from Vancouver shores The ravens and the seagulls push each other inward and outward Inward and outward In this place that I call home My brain's the cliff and my heart's the bitter buffalo My heart's the bitter buffalo We tore one down and erected another there The match of the century, absence versus thin air I'm on my way to God don't know My brain's the burger and my heart's the coal In this life that we call home The years go fast and the days go so slow The days go so slow The days go slow
