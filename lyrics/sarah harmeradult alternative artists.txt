Out of the night, into the water We push the boat from shore Breaking the air in the stillness of the bay Intensity of stars reflected in the harbour Silently ignite The oar dips in to oil like water and we Are away Your hand won't write, not tonight But your mind may wander Into those deep lagoons that you know And your boat will go, by starlight alone"Da da da da da da da da"You sang to the moon In the great black night with no lodestar In sight Out in the night, out on the water We pull the boat back to shore Breathing the air in the stillness of the bay Intensity of stars reflected in the water Silently ignite The oar dips in to oil like water and we Are away Under the moon In the great black night with no lodestar In sightYou live out where the street ends In a basement apartment with one of your friends And the tap drips all night Water torture in the sink The furnace is burning But it's still cold, I think I can smell the bleach That they use in the hall But it can't clean the dirt off of me It's seeping under the door In across the floor It's starting to hurt Every time I breathe Every time I try to leave Every time I breathe Now the toaster sticks And the empties are piled I haven't been up the stairs in awhile now I gotta wash the sheets on my bed I gotta watch those things that go unsaid God, I wish we'd leave it at thisWhen the sun comes up do you ever stop to think About the air that you breathe and the water that you drink Beyond these walls is our natural habitat Mother nature provides everything we need - imagine that The oceans and the rivers and the fresh water lakes The birds singing in the trees the music that it makes The mountains and the valleys and the Newfoundland coast I'll have oatmeal for breakfast with some peanut butter toast And when the sun goes down do you ever look around And smell the dew on the grass and hear the nighttime sounds The owl gets up and the robin goes to bed To a nest made of twigs, he lays his little robin head The oceans and the rivers and the freshwater lakes The birds singing in the trees the music that it makes The mountains and the valleys and the Newfoundland coast I'll have oatmeal for breakfast with some peanut butter toastCan we get the ocean to freeze over Sandy banks of snow across the road Keep the full moon high over your shoulder But keep the puck low, we don't want to go looking for it In the headlights' glow we played til frozen Until the battery ran low Until the call of home came calling Calling across the air on the wires of woodsmoke Oh, I miss you tonight in St  Peter's Bay And I'll miss you in the morning Still, we had a good skate, didn't we, babe I couldn't get the fire of my faith in us Warm enough to comfort your cold feet Every little crack in the ice seemed to be enough To make you think you might go under So stay to the shore, and wonder some more Reconsider every direction The ice out here's black, the only thing looking back is my own reflection Oh, I miss you tonight in St  Peter's Bay And I'll miss you in the morning Still, we had a good skate, didn't we, babe And so tides will shift and ice will lift And creeks will run again with their thundering And no more I'll be an island, an island adrift In an ocean of endless wonderingI can't throw away my fears Up into the atmosphere They race away at the rate Of the smoke and rust Look at all the poor bastards Gotta go to work while I sleep Steel town's lights keep on glowing From smokestacks that keep on blowing In my eyes, so I don't see it Close my heart, so I don't feel it Everytime I can see it in your eyes I can feel it on your sighs They're not like either of us At all Look at all the poor drivers Gotta go to work everytime Streams of headlights come flashing On the hills that we used for crashing In my mind I don't see it Close my eyes, or I believe itI didn't go to Washington, instead I swept the floor The only things I've ever done you can't see anymore I knew there would be magic but I turned down the last chance These idle hands are staying scared of making any plans'Cause the fire needed tending and the windows are so wide Sometimes I feel I'm in the world when I'm looking from inside I will pack down the snow, make a path to the road And I'll think of the long ride I hope you don't need snow tires through the Pennsylvania night'Cause I didn't go, I said no, I said no when you asked Now the only things I'm feeling are the empty minutes pass The sun came up and moved around, it's down behind a cloud I didn't go to Washington and you'll be almost there by nowHey what about me When can I tumble like Old Neil Ass over heels When can I float above the road see how that feels Who made these promises to raise the hopes of dopes like us We should know by now that when it comes to dreams we're suckers still When it comes to dreams we're suckers stills Hey what about me when can I skip across the dust of my own moon When can I wave goodbye to a planet laying in ruin When thye're handing out the star command I'll be an old confused earth-bound man The price was right but it came to late This engine's fueled on sour grapes My engine's fueled on sour grapes Hey what about me When can I tumble like Old Neil Ass over heels When can I float above the road see how that feels Who made these promises to raise the hopes of dopes like us We should know by now that when it comes to dreams we're suckers still When it comes to dreams we're suckers stillsWell now how did they get that lady on T VLaughing so naturally For a Wal-Mart ad Is it not as bad as I thought There's a woman sending poisonous mail And they caught her now she's sitting in jail While the weather station forecasts hail From the tropics Oh I spent the day in a shopping mall Through the biggest storm of the century I'm a mountain I'm a mountain like you said to be The sports man and his double chin Don't listen to me in this state I'm in Saying things about people that I don't know Well it's just that way when you get hurt And the things you need you're made to work You must decide if you will die or grow Oh I spent the day in a shopping mall Through the biggest storm of the century I'm a mountain I'm a mountain Like you said to beIf I only had one match left Would I try to light a fire under you If I could only say one thing Would it be what I've been wanting to Every time I close the gate I wonder if this is enough If I only had one match left I would try to light it between us If we only spoke with our minds I would never look you in the eye Cause I think I might have heard some things You told me even if you didn't try All the thoughts that we've been pondering I think that they'd add up to be enough If we only spoke with our minds Our lips might find a way to say so much Oh little fire sleepy in the coals open up the door see a flame unfold Stoke with words you say and the way you say them Little fire awaits for you to get close to him oooooooooooh If you only want to stay safe and tucked under the covers of your bed I would tell you that I knew what it was like And of the dreams that I've been living in instead And those times I close my eyes and wonder what we could do with this loveKaleidoscope, wheel of hope A place to start out from Although it started long ago The world's work has begun A hula hoop, a human chain To warm our hands and find our way When all the lights go out A raincoat and a French beret The rolling hills of past mistakes Lie quiet under cloud And I we'll all look to the churning sea This call to arms means wrap them Around the first person you see Dandelions in bullet holes We stand in our civilian clothes On blankets laid out on a lawn Clouds of rain will all move on And when the mist clears, we will see Both of our names on a marquee Across the ocean the same day And then washed ashore a block away
