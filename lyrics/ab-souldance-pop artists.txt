by the minute Its mine, I spend it; my mind is spinnin'Your time is tickin', the sky's the limit We in a space where matter don't matter Just spirit molecules and geometric patterns Shitted in a crater last time I sat on Saturn Got a letter from Andromeda, they tryna shrine my bladderSaucy Your momma told me, "Read the Book of Job"They should've called it the Book of Soul I came into this hurtful Earth in perfect health Caught Stevens-Johnson syndrome when I was 10 years old Internal and external fever, 80%...Fatality rate at that time, ain't that some shit Severe pinkeye, my eyes swollen shut For like two or three months, it's still bright as fuck Oh, and I even lost my lip skin Grew back darker than its original pigment Skin disfigured from boils and blisters Unidentifiable by my little sister Come to think of it, I could've got a crazy check The shrink thought I'd be traumatized, but I'ma ride My first years of Junior High School were not alright Them dimes wouldn't give me no time, no, not a nod I mean not even you, we eventually got cool But I was nobody, you was the hottest hottie in the school Or the world to me, not saying that 'cause I'm your dude I'm glad I got to watch the woman that you blossomed to Ironic, we always had the same classes I copied off your work And you ain't always have the right answers But it worked, mama, thanks a lot Probably wouldn't have even graduated had you not Somewhere down the line, we became an item The love was in the air like this flight I'm lighting The first few years were so exciting Got deeper in this rap and started pushing shit back My money got funny, you wanted to go on dates I had a Sounwave beat tape tryna beat Drake Could've spent every minute with you, but I had to get it For me and you, you sing too, so you knew the business I know it was hard, but you stayed down My fam had doubts, you told me you was proud I did some things, you did some things, always came back together We knew the only way to make it work is work together Seven whole years, seven whole years It was supposed to end with our grandkids Luckily for me, I'm used to being cut short I'm such a nice guy, why, Lord Why Lori  Why you had to take her from me Guess He needed your angel face for all of Heaven to see Your picture's still on my mirror, and it's so scary I swear I still ain't looked at your obituary So now, I'm so doped up, I think I'm flying I hope this spliff'll never finish I guess the Mayans wasn't lying2012, my world ended You used to say that I could see the future You was wrong, 'cause you was in it And I was just with you the day before You said you loved me, I said I loved you more And as much I wanna cower, bid the mic adieu And fall off a fucking tower tryna find you I gotta stay 'cause I remember that day I looked you in the face and told you:"Nothing can stop me, not even you"Stick to the plan, I'll meet you at our spot If reincarnation is true and we don't get too lost Even if you forget me and everything you left behind I never lied, I love you in a place where there's no space and time I close my eyes, and I can still hear you singing loud We never got to tell them who The Love Religion was about I ain't finna stage a cry in this rhyme Signed, sincerely yours, I live to let you..
