Lord, I'm going uptown To the Harlem River to drown Dirty water gonna cover me over And I'm not gonna make a sound I'm on a roll, mama, I gotta go Gotta get there while I still can Troubled days are behind me now And I know they're gonna let me in When you see me walking up the F DR Just a-singing and a-clapping my hands Tell my mama I love her, tell my father I tried Give my money to my baby to spend'Cause Lord, I'm going uptown To the Harlem River to drown Dirty water gonna cover me over And I'm not gonna make a sound Good times come and they go Even a good man'll break He'll let his troubles bury him whole Even though he knows what's at stakeI swear I see her in my dreams sometimes Held up in the middle of the night Shakin like a pistol in a young mans hand There in the pale moonlight Standin up the top of that lonely hill Spared by the company mines Is my blue eyed baby with her best dress on In the shadow of a lonely pine It was back before the war When the company came These hills grew wild and free Me and baby we'd hide in the hollers low Away from the cruel sun's heat But then they knocked down the timber And burned off the brush To get to the riches below And when they pulled out They left a cold black ground And one pine standing lone So take me home...Lone pine hill I signed up back in '61 I'm an army of Virginia man I've been from Mannasas to Mackonackey All the way to Sailors Creek fighting For my home land After 4 years gone and all hope lost And Richmond under seige And we're diggin out Five Forks And waitin in the rain For Sheridan to bring us to our knees So take me home...Lone pine hill There's a strange moon hangin' overhead tonight And if the rain keeps comin then the creek's gonna rise With the good lord's grace I'll make it outta this place and I'll be in your arms come the morning light I swear...So god grant me speed and grant me forgiveness And carry me on through the night Take me through your hills and over your rivers Away from this awful fight Cause I ain't never known a man that's ever owned another Ain't never owned nothin' of my own And after 4 long years I just can't tell you What the hell I've been fighting for...So take me home...Lone pine hillIf you don't like sunny days Then I'll make it rain Make a bird sing Any song you wanna hear it singing Fix all your broken things If I was the devil I'll take you down And put you in my house Keep you nice and close Teach you what you don't know I'll take you from the holy ghost If I was the devil You might not believe in me But I'll make you believe And you'll know my name You might not believe me But I'll make you believe And you'll know my nameI am my father's son I've never known when to shut up I ain't fooling no one I am my father's son We don't see eye to eye And I'll be the first to admit I've never tried It's sure it hurts, but it should hurt sometimes We don't see eye to eye I was a young man when I first found the pleasure in the feel of a sin I went down the same road as my old man But I was younger then Now its 3 AM and I'm standing in the kitchen Holding my last cigarette Strike a match and I see my reflection in the mirror in the hall And I say to myselfTired of laying in bed, listening to the water run Ceiling's falling in, baby's dress is covered in dust So I don't care what it costs, baby, dust that old thing off It's one more night in Brooklyn, baby, we're getting lost I ain't taking you home, I found a little place that'll do It'll never match the beauty of a Tennessee spring, but it's something new So let 'em say what they'll say, I'll find a way that we'll make it pay It's one more night in Brooklyn, baby, that's all I can take I'm tired of waiting on you Waiting on a train I'm tired of your late night calls With the same old complaints So you pack up your bags, start looking west, but tonight Ordering in, making damn sure we don't leave nothing behind Baby, put your hands on me, let's get real high and just go to sleep It's one more night in Brooklyn, baby, it's just you and me One more nightWell he woke up that morning and he called into work Put on his daddy's old suit with a second hand shirt All untucked, shoes untied, the people all snickered as he walked by So he stopped in a bar, bought a shot of Stevens, and another He bummed a cigarette, and sat talking with a stranger about the weather And then he paid his bill and he stepped outside, fell down into the street He cursed, and he cried as he climbed back up to his feet again So up the road he found a payphone and called his mom He said, "Mama I think I'll be coming home I been feeling so bad, and tired of this city Ain't been the same since I lost my pretty Angeline, Mama I miss her so It's been over a year and there ain't nothing I fear so much as being alone."And then he hung up the phone without saying good-bye Stopped in a store and bought a postcard and signed it"Fare thee well", and sent it back home to Yuma Lookin' back I'd say, it wasn't so much the girl As it was the booze and the dope And the way he took the weight of the world up upon his shoulders And let it wash the blue from his eyes as he grew colder As through all those lonely nights there left alone So he was just 23 when he stepped out on that ledge It was his weary heart that pushed him to the edge He was tired of living life, looking for love"A weary heart just needs a little touch And is it too much to ask ", he cried as he stepped into the wind He turned his back on the world and he fell back to Earth againI'm a bad dream I'm not a nightmare, I'm too pretty for that Let's just say I'm the last thing you wanna see coming I'm the reason they say watch your back For so long, I was like a wounded hound Backed into a chainlink fence The world at large was just a big, mean kid Poking me through the fence with a stick Ain't nobody goin' back It takes a whole lotta hurt Therein lies one of life's biggest lessons Ain't got nothin' to do with deserve Just pray to the Saint of Lost Causes Now it's a cruel world But it ain't hard to understand You got your sheep, got your shepherds Got your wolves amongst men It can be hard to tell You might find a wolf in shepherd's clothes And now and then you're gonna find sheep Hidden amongst all those troubled souls You know the folks that's most afraid of the wolf If you really stop and think Throughout time, between a wolf and a shepherd Who do you think has killed more sheep Nah, there's nothing can be done It's just the way it goes First you get bad, then you get mean Then there's nothing left but to grow cold And pray to the Saint of Lost CausesHair up high and seat reared back Looked like she should be driving something long and black All I’m asking you Brother do you know her Pretty little thing riding by in a champagne Corolla I've seen you around just here just last night Today she been by two or three times Ain’t you listening to me Lord I done told you Pretty little thing riding by in a champagne Corolla I asked the boys on the corner Did they know how many them things you think is out on the road The one I mean I say if you seen her you know her Pretty little thing riding by in a champagne Corolla I don’t care what no man say She can run all week on just one tank Goes to show you Maybe baby got a head on her shoulders And she sure looks sweet driving by in that champagne CorollaWell, she comes out at night with the cold winds of December And when it's quiet you hear her engines cry She blows smoke at her wheels and her gears pound the steel As they carry her on down the line Now I'm sure that you've heard stories, as most of us have In the lunch counter and barber shop queues She's the Ghost of Virginia and from here up to Richmond She runs by the light of the moon Well a few years back on the old Suffolk Road Where it crosses the abandoned rail line My Grandpa claimed that he'd seen a freight train And it wasn't no sleek streamline She was cold black and steel and she screamed as she cut Her way clear of the pines But he swears to this day he can feel the earth shake And smell her smoke when the wind's just right Ah, but back in her day she was a real working horse Haulin' coal out for old man Ward She was tied up in ribbons and set out of Richmond Haulin' soldiers during the war Ah, but some say she wrecked and she rides these rails Hopin' one day that she'll get it right Others say she roams out picking up lost souls And carryin' 'em down to CarolinaMy best friend lived in this house And we played ball in the street after school God knows how he's living now I heard his mom lost the house and had to move And sure, it's looking better these days Well it's hard to believe And this ain't the way it was back in 1993 And those weren't better days But they still meant something to me When we was kids out in the streets Now there was a market on the corner, it was next to the car wash And a lazy weeping willow across the street in the light Where the old men played dominoes on those hot summer days Sweatin' their Wild Irish Rose out in the shade And from Wedgewood to Granny White Oh, and Belmont to 8th All these songs was broke into a host of sights and shapes And that was low-rent livin'Back when life was cheap When we was kids out in the streets
