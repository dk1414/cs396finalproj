Next to Hudson Yards, it's crowded on the weekdays From April to May Parse apart a troubled heart from an e-train And sing about it in L AWith clouds in the rearview You start humming along to the first verse Of your favorite song that you quote each day With the words all wrong So call me when the world looks bleak I love you, but it’s hard to believe With every day, we'll start to see The rest is metamodernity With agrestic charm, it's humid in the Midwest From June to July All beneath a pinkish sky from the wildfires Which mantle the horizon line From the outset It’s been hard to tell why we feel this down When it all bodes wellIt's one hazy panoply Recount this halcyon age I turn to Anthony When he turned to Karlheinz and Cage But no one's really there Does that mean it's done in vain If no one really cares I'm back to acting strange Like Daniel Johnston in Texas At some point in the eighties Passing out his cassettes with The J-card that he drew, oh did he ever expect it I guess it's just what happens when the music's a respite The world is so appalling and you come to detest it And you could say that I was nervous then Fairly awkward now Leave the speakers loud When you feel self-doubt If there's any chance That we'd still hang out We could detail dreams While we stare at passing cloudsNice to see you How you doing Did you know you're Really something You make me feel things I don't believe in It's all up in my heart And all up in my spine those chills I 'spose someday these roads will reach the sea It's safe to say they're tailor-made for replaying scenes But I'm too pensive To decide what's real All cause you left me with a heart chock-full of chills In the morning sun You and I are one Fingers through my hair Feel them everywhere Don't know what to think Am I still dreaming You're so perfect baby were you made for meHeaded west now from the blighted plain It's kind of gorgeous in a Georgic way Staring outside, watching every change I think it's just a type of way to explain how I miss you How I hope you're fine That I've been sad Tracing Lichtenstein With my eyes closed On the phone at night Always bummed out'Cause the world's not right At this time At the drive-thru with the headlights on And now I'm feeling like I'm Roquentin In a streetcar Near Corrine Marchand I'll go Michel Legrand and set it to song How I miss you How I hope you're fine That I've been sad Tracing Lichtenstein With my eyes closed On the phone at night Always bummed outIf you're bummed out Feel free to talk with me How does lunch sound I'll ask you about your week And the comedown Always rehashing scenes When the sun's down And half of the world's asleep I'm half-asleep And I wonder What you would have done If I kissed you I had my chance I held your hand And leaned up close to you Now it just seems like I messed up I don't know what to do All I know is I'm nervous that you don't like me too I thought that home was where you are until that home is where I left I found a home inside myself since no home for me was left I slept with poems in my hands for seven days Slept alone and wept by twilight saw a throne, a silent phone in heaven's name Cause home can change and it does Coining names for new love Joining strange depictions tinted with that rose from my bud Cause blood is thick but smoke be thick as hell Eyes low, my mind been shell or shellshocked With lonely mail all cluttered on my desktop You still got best box, cutter slice and dice me sideways stumped Stutter with that t-t-tongue I scream gently how'd you undo us For goodness sake you make me undone These poems underneath my nails Sweat makes the ink run Smolder-heady memory brain shoulder a pink love My poem's in the mail It was tears that made the ink run Heavy molting memory brain shedding a pink tonI never wanna be alone But now that you're gone I'm thinking that this love is all but done Nothing's ever been so clear But when you're near I'm feeling like anytime I change my mind here And I should say I'm fine here Just to leave your mind at ease And I mostly stay inside here And then I watch as all these Dreams fall far from the ocean floor While years roll by in the driftless north How inexorably all things fade And still half hoping that somehow Everything can turn out ok I never wanna be alone But now that you're gone I'm thinking that this love is all but done Nothing's ever been so clear But when you're near I'm feeling like anytime I change my mind hereI turned my Starcaster to a star catcher Might visit nostalgia and chip my sanity Still one with the heat of cigar ember At peace with knowing I could leave forever tomorrow I’m on the brink of nirvana, I’m so omniscient See all and I’m a miss you I’m overseas and still haven’t seen God That brother M IA as fuck My mama pray for me often bet she probably Shake my luck, I been surrounded by crosses ever since I could look Up on the balcony, smell the sea and the breeze And if you ever did doubt on me, I would truly hate to be you Honestly it’s me and my family on the easel So that’s the reason I see some people that's see through You fuckin’ phonies, I keep my distance and piece with it Sounds mad wavy, get eargasms or seasickness Leave em’ with an imprint deeper than O Gs did it No overdose but still hella O DStill hella O DThe shore seems small when you're up this high And air stays cold with the changing tides The feeling's strange knowing you've arrived The path behind, star catcher’s twine That’s lifeSince we last spoke The past eleven weeks The stacks of paper left me feeling Like sentience is not quite what it seems When we last wrote It was the sun and me With cliffs as high and fears as deep With my magnum opus, my starry-eyed recitative The color on these trees It's like something from a movie Last night, I smiled While laughing at a moonbeam We're all moving I felt awoke Our summer music spree My reflections on being cut free It's turning out to be the strength I need I hope you know That there's still joy for me In fleeting moments, I take relief In my suspicion that these past months were a dreamYours truly I walk on clouds Look down and see the world from a point of view we're true Never followed trends did what few would do Still drop tunes for you and you I'm from the glove, Motor City show me love and I show it back Check my stats Capricorn on the zodiac All the real heads know the raps Guilt Simpson in the back toasting cognac Cheers How's this happening Yours truly Sincerely, Q CP S, pump your B S breaks I'm groovy, the dream Borderline M LK Jr  and Juicy So those from loose leaf to phonos Como to how you not know My whole style is go buckwild But look both ways like Musiq Soulchild My new bowl not in my house If you plannin' to put shade in the sauce It's like Buble to white folks when I write quotes Something about it left their eyes cloudyThinking back to phase one With woolen mallets and the bass drums Early hours in the drive-thru Playing early D II V and Nite Jewel We found ourself in stage three Observing murals dotting Lake Street With every story comes a stalemate When you've been living in a failed state The night gets cold but there's smoke in the clouds I'm having trouble sleeping and it's stressing me out The words may fall short of something profound But every time I'm with you I'm just glad you're around How's it sound Laid out in programmatic sets of three We keep thе time and music sets the scеne What's after the dream My point of reference is the northern sky Sometimes the synthesizer makes me cry We'll dance for a while Two, three, four
