Airborne Brigade on Operation Hump, War Zone D in Vietnam were ambushed by over 1200 V.C  Forty-eight American soldiers lost their lives that day Severely wounded and riskin' his own life, Lawrence Joll, a medic was the first livin' black man since the Spanish-American War to receive the United States Medal of Honor for savin' so many lives in the midst of battle that day Our friend, Nialls Harris, retired 25 years, United States Army,  was one of the wounded who lived  This song is his story Caught in the action of 'kill or be killed' -- 'Greater love hath no man to lay down his life for a friend'."Said goodbye to his momma as he left South Dakota To fight for the red, white, and blue He was 19 and green with a new M-16 Just doing what he had to do He was dropped in the jungle where the choppers would rumble With the smell of napalm in the air And the sergeant said, "Look up ahead"Like a dark evil cloud, 1,200 came down on him and 29 more They fought for their lives but most of them died in the 173rd Airborne On the 8th of November the angels were crying As they carried his brothers away With the fire raining down and the hell all around There were few men left standing that day Saw the eagle fly through a clear blue sky1965, the 8th of November Now he's 58 and his pony tail's gray But the battle still plays in his head He limps when he walks but he's strong when he talks About the shrapnel they left in his leg He puts on a gray suit over his Airborne tattoo And he ties it on one time a year And remembers that fallen as he orders a tall one And swallows it down with tearsBrother and sisters We are here for one reason And one reason alone To share our love of music I present to you Country music without prejudice, hey Country boys don't rock and roll Yeah the record man told me so Yeah you'll never get it on the radio Why they trying to complicate The simple music that we make Oh cause if it moves my soul I'm gonna keep on rollin, rollin Hey, just wanna hear everybody sing At the top of your lungs till the windows break Say hey, hey, hey I ain't gonna shut my mouth Don't mind if I stand out in a crowd Just wanna live outloud Well I know there's got to be A few hundred million more like me Just trying to keep it free, yeahIt's a 3 day drive if she drives all night Says she's leavin' at the crack of dawn Well she might still be lyin' here with me But in her heart she's already gone Already packed up, the Altima's gassed up She's done put the map up there on the dash I'm all tore up just tryin' to man up Damnin' these tears up but can't hold 'em back Cause she's in love with California And that west coast sunshine dream These ain't no Hollywoods And these hills ain't Beverly Ain't no beaches on these backroads No sunset on the boulevard She's in love with California And breakin' my heart Got a waitress job waitin' in an ihop Throw a rock and hit universal city Got a glamour shot in her hip pocket Hopin' somebody'll think she's pretty By this time tomorrow she'll hit Colorado I'll be drownin' my sorrow in a bottle of Beam Before she hits flagstaff maybe she'll backtrack But I wouldn't bet that if I was meWell we're comin to your city Gonna play our guitars and sing you a country song We'll all be flyin higher than a jet air liner And if you want a little bang in your ying yang come along Well we flew through Cincinnati And we all got really happy Grabbed a bowl of that Skyline Chili along the way Then we rolled on into Canton Scared the hell out of Marilyn Manson And the party started happenin Hey hey hey Then in the middle of a Charleston night We ran into Jesco White And a little moonshine got us right plum smacked insane Well we're comin to your city Gonna play our guitars and sing you a country song We'll all be flyin higher than a jet air liner And if you want a little bang in your ying yang come along Well we broke down in Greenville In the middle of a hayfield But a Bud Light truck pulled up and helped us outSaid goodbye to his mama as he left South Dakota To fight for the red, white, and blue He was 19 and green with a new M-16 Just doin' what he had to do He was dropped in the jungle where the
