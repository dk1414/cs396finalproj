You were so down yesterday  You were never one for winter, relentlessly gray  So pour two glasses and leave the light in the driveway on  I need to feel your trembling lips on my neck  I'll never leave you alone again to stare this dreadful world in its cold dark eyes again  Life can be such a ruse  I'm not coming home for Christmas, I'm coming home for you  Stack your troubles on my shoulders and take a deep breath  Don't choke on your freedom  Those cold lonely mornings aren't yours anymore  I think I can already see the fire in your eyesFocus Commitment and trust give in to me Friendship Forged through broken bones and tragedy I can't fucking believe This joke has gotten out of hand Won't pretend Won't pretend I don't feel the break, but I feel the bend Late night, snowfall Get us to the hospital Jamestown, 94 West And a forty-hour train back to Penn When leaves fall If it means anything, it just means you're dead When snow falls It means my feet just flew over my head I can't fucking believe This joke has gotten out of hand Won't pretend Won't pretend I don't feel the break, but I feel the bendThis is much better than it ever was before And next year, I better have my foot in the door'Cause all along, I felt it all so much Now I'm feeling strong But hard work seems to get me nowhere So ears to the wall and listen for one shred of hope ignore the sound of good to come This time next year Nothing is better than making my own day But anything is better than wasting away When all along, I let them get to me But not for long, 'cause this time next year, I'll be listening So ears to the wall and listen for one shred of hope ignore the sound of good to come This time next year You can get next to me, but you can't read my mind I'll have faith in...I gotta have faith in, in what no one else will I'll have faith in...I gotta have faith in, in what no one else will I'll have faith in...I'll have faith in, in what no one else willYou've always been the full stop to end my paragraphs We don't need a bigger bed, I need you closer I don't want to be buried next to you One casket for the two of us should do To be alone with myself for eternity would be agony You've always been the one to breathe me back to life When my appetite for living dies You breathe me back to life Tripping through the perils of this comedy You shoulder the brunt of my misery I envy the lightness in your heart How do I dream without waking up To be alone with myself for eternity would be agony You've always been the one to breathe me back to life When my appetite for living dies You're the cure when my thoughts turn to cyanide When I go out of my fucking mind You're the cure and your eyes have dug me out of my grave more times You're the cure and your eyes have dug me out of my grave more times than I could ever keep count You've always been the one to breathe me back to life When my appetite for living dies You're the cure when my thoughts turn to cyanide When I go out of my fucking mind You breathe me back to lifeWhen Kelly cries, the makeup runs from her eyes And spills the truth about how she feels inside When Kelly screams, it usually means I'm not being me Or she's not being her, but anyway A second chance means nothing If nothing's learned from past mistakes And I'm sure we've felt the weight, the weight'Cause three whole years fall on deaf ears Are these snowflakes or solid tears Three whole years fall on deaf ears If you can't understand our fears, it's not fair to me Do you remember when  Kelly, do you remember when When I figured it was cool, and I figured wrong A second chance means nothing If nothing's learned from past mistakes And I'm sure we've felt the weight And do you know how I know Because all the times we looked in each other's eyes And we ignored all the signs And three whole years fall on deaf ears Are these snowflakes or solid tears Three whole years fall on deaf ears If you can't understand our fears, it's not fair to meTo the grave and back again  It's been so long, friend, how ya been  Can you find it in your heart to just let me in  Or I could just bash in your door again  Dripping from my fingers, pouring from my heart  I can't stay away, I'm yours until it falls apart  I see you're feeling hesitant, your reservations evident  I could smash in your windows and slash all your tires  Can we just do this the easy way  Dripping from my fingers, pouring from my heart  I can't stay away, I'm yours until I fall apart  Why can't we move on like none of this ever even happened Recover the pieces Recover the pieces, it's all I've got And remember me not This feeling is empty This feeling is empty It's all you gave to me and...All those fucked up things you put me through You lost the only thing you had left to lose Tragic mistake Under the circumstance You act like a kid and you walked away What was the last thing that you said You're shying away 'cause you wanted it everyday And you lost it all You lost it all Break through the casing Break through the casing, it's what's inside All those things that you hide Pull skin from your fingers Pull skin from your fingers to ignore me like alwaysI heard about your appearance at the party that no one went to In your own sick way, you've always given me everything I never want to see you so all alone Pick up the phone and breathe to me I don't know why I feel more drunk when I get sober And I'll never know why you let it pull you under All I ever needed was a real friend And I got one in Lake Superior You wouldn't believe the price of being honest with yourself You'd be tossing a dime to the man in the cardboard box I want to wake up when it's over Wake me up and marry me I don't know why I feel more drunk when I get sober And I'll never know why you let it pull you under All I ever needed was a real friend And I got one in Lake Superior In Lake SuperiorHey, I guess I'll figure it out The reasons why things went the way they did And why we can't accept it We'd fall asleep, but not before we exorcised the evil thing that everyone hides We would lie there in my bed Do you remember all those nights we never slept No clothes, sweaty doing all the things I never thought I'd do And I did them with you And hey, don't feel bad No one can ever take away the boardwalk trips or the subways I think we grew up Past the hang-ups and the evil stares The "fuck you too"s and "I don't care"s We would lie there in my bed Do you remember all those nights we never slept No clothes, sweaty doing all the things I never thought I'd do And i did them with you Hey, I guess I'll figure it out The reasons why things went the way they did And why we can't accept it We'd fall asleep, but not before we exorcised the evil thing that everyone hides We would lie there in my bed Do you remember all those nights we never sleptLa, La, La, La, La, La La, La, La, La, La, La, La Sister Saint Monica You've got me on my knees How can I make up for being
