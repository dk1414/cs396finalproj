Even through the darkest phase Be it thick or thin Always someone marches brave Here beneath my skin And constant Craving Has always Been Maybe a great magnet pulls All souls to what's true Or maybe it is life itself Feeds wisdom to its youth Constant Craving Has always Been Craving Ah, constant craving Has always been Has always beenI heard there was a secret chord That David played, and it pleased the Lord You don't really care for music, do ya Well it goes like this The fourth, the fifth The minor fall, the major lift The baffled king composing Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Well your faith was strong but you needed proof You saw her bathing on the roof Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya Well she tied you to her kitchen chair She broke your throne and cut your hair And from your lips she drew Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Baby I've been here before I've seen this room and I've walked the floor Used to live alone before I knew ya But I've seen your flag on the marble arch Our love is not a victory march It's a cold and it's a broken HallelujahJust a kiss, just a kiss I have lived just for this I can't explain why I've become Miss Chatelaine Just a smile, just a smile Hold me captive just a while I can't explain why I've become Miss Chatelaine Every time your eyes meet mine Clouds of qualm Burst into sunshine Just a sigh, just a sigh Words my love just reply I can't explain why I've become Miss Chatelaine Miss Chatelaine Just a smile, a smile Hold me captive just a while I can't explain why I've become Miss ChatelaineThere is a town in north Ontario With dream comfort memory to spare And in my mind I still need a place to go All my changes were there Blue, blue window behind the stars Yellow moon on the rise Big birds flying across the sky Throwing shadows in our eyes Leaves us Helpless, helpless, helpless Helpless, helpless, helpless Baby, can you hear me now The chains are locked and tied around my door And baby, will you sing with me somehow Helpless, helpless, helpless Helpless, helpless, helpless Helpless, helpless, helpless Helpless, helplessI know a place Pretty as pie Out where the riverbend Hits up with the end of the sky It's left of Nebraska And over a crest On a little patch of heaven Way out west Ev'rything's green Know what I mean Darlin', it's quite the sweetest sight Thatcha ever done seen Ain't nothin' much out there Just life at its best On that little patch of heaven Way out west Bees by the dozen Are buzzin' real peaceful Ev'ry bluebonnet Doggone it, smells niceSave me Save me from you But pave me the way to you Lead me upon the captive free Gracious and tame like love can be Lead me upon Spoil me Spoil me with you And soil me with the world of you Watch over me with a mother's eyes Judging my worth only to glorify Watch over me Save me, save me Save me, save me Carry Carry me through And bury all my doubts of you Clothe my desire with spell or prayer I'll shroud every sign of need I swear Clothe my desireYou swim Swim through my veins Drown me In your reign My desire Carries no shame My will Will harbour no pain Wash Wash me clean Mend my wounded seams Cleanse my tarnished dreams Swim Swim through my veins Drown me In your reign Wash Wash me clean Mend my wounded seams Cleanse my tarnished dreamsFlawless light in a darkening air Alone..  and shining there Love will not elude you Love is simple I worship this tenacity And the beautiful struggle we're in Love will not elude us Love is simple Be sure to know that All in love Is ours That love, as a philosophy Is simple I am calm in oblivion Calm as I ever have been Love will not elude me Love is simple Be sure to know that All in love Is ours...Is ours...That all in love Is ours And love, as a philosophy Is simple...And ours.. As things start to surface And tears come on down The scars of childhood In a small town The hurt she pushed inward Is starting to show Now she'll do some talking But he'll never know The tables have turned now With a child of her own But she's blind to the difference What's taught is what's known Numbed by reaction And stripped of the trust A young heart is broken Not aware that it's just A family tradition The strength of this land Where what's right and wrong Is the back of a hand Turns girls into women And a boy to a man The rights of the children Have nowhere to standI was alright for a while I could smile for a while Then I saw you last night You held my hand so tight When you stopped to say hello You wished me well, you couldn't tell That I'd been crying over you Crying over you Then you said so long And left me standing all alone Alone and crying Crying, crying, crying It's hard to understand That the touch of your hand Can start me crying I thought that I was over you But it's true, so true I love you even more than I did before But darling what can I do No you don't love me and I'll always be Crying over you Crying over you Yes, now you're gone And from this moment on I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying Crying, crying, over you
