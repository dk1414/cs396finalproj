Come to my window Crawl inside Wait by the light of the moon Come to my window I'll be home soon I would dial the numbers Just to listen to your breath And I would stand inside my hell And hold the hand of death You don't know how far I'd go To ease this precious ache And you don't know how much I'd give Or how much I can take Just to reach you Just to reach you Oh, to reach you Oh Come to my window Crawl inside Wait by the light of the moon Come to my window I'll be home soonPlease, baby, can't you see My mind's a burnin' hell I got razors a-rippin' and tearin' and strippin'My heart apart as well Tonight you told me That you ache for something new And some other woman is looking like somethin'That might be good for you Go on, and hold her 'til the screaming is gone Go on, believe her when she tells you Nothing's wrong But I'm the only one Who'll walk across the fire for you I'm the only one Who'll drown in my desire for you It's only fear that makes you run The demons that you're hiding from When all your promises are gone I'm the only one Please baby can't you see I'm trying to explain I've been here before and I'm locking the door And I'm not going back again Her eyes and arms and skin won't make It go away You'll wake up tomorrow and wrestle the sorrow That holds you down todayI know you're home You left your light on You know I'm here The night is thin I know you're alone I watched the car leave Your lover is gone Let me in Open your back door I just need to touch you once more Oh, oh I wanna come over To hell with the consequence You told me you love me That's all I believe I wanna come over It's a need I can't explain To see you again I wanna come over I know your friend You told her about me She filled you with fear Some kind of sin How can you turn Denying the fire Lover I burn Let me inTonight I feel so weak But all in love is fair I turn the other cheek And I feel the slap and the sting Of the foul night air And I know You're only human And I haven't got Talking room But tonight while I'm making excuses Some other woman Is making love to you Somebody bring me some water Can't you see I'm burning alive Can't you see my baby's Got another lover I don't know how I'm gonna survive Somebody bring me some water Can't you see it's out of control Baby's got my heart And my baby's got my mind But tonight the sweet devil Sweet devil's got my soulIn these days and these hours of fury When the darkness and answers are thin Lovers come and check out in a hurry Shallow and hollow again Come lay your body beside me To dream, to sleep with the lamb To the question your eyes seem to send Am I your passion Your promise Your end I say I am Yes I am Yes I am Yes I am I am your passion Your promise Your end Yes I am Barring divine intervention There is nothing between you and I And if I carelessly forgot to mention Your body, your power, can sanctify Come feed the hunger, the thirst Lay it down, the beast will die You can question my heart once again10:03 on a Tuesday morning In the fall of an American dream A man is doing what he knows is right On flight 93 He loved his mom and he loved his dad He loved his home and he loved his man But on that bloody Tuesday morning He died an American Now you cannot change this You can't erase this You can't pretend this is not the truthHave I been sleeping I’ve been so still Afraid of crumbling Have I been careless Dismissing all the distant rumblings Take me where I am supposed to be To comprehend the things that I can’t see Cause I need to move I need to wake up I need to change I need to shake up I need to speak out Something’s got to break up I’ve been asleep And I need to wake up Now And as a child I danced like it was 1999 My dreams were wild The promise of this new world Would be mine Now I am throwing off the carelessness of youth To listen to an inconvenient truthGo on and close your eyes Go on imagine me there She got similar features With longer hair And if that's what it takes To get you through Go on and close your eyes It shouldn't bother you You never had to wait For nothing in your life I guess wanting me must have been A steel blue knife And when night after night The scent of passion would linger You had to have the jewels Wrapped around your finger Now you keep running down the road In your midnight state of mind Curiosity kills If you can't read the signs Go on and close your eyes Imagine me there She got similar features With longer hair And if that's what it takes To get you through Go on and close your eyes It shouldn't bother youIt's been years since they told her about it The darkness her body possessed And the scars are still there in the mirror Everyday that she gets herself dressed Though the pain is miles and miles behind her And the fear is now a docile beast If you ask her why she is still running She'll tell you it makes her complete I run for hope I run to feel I run for the truth For all that is real I run for your mother your sister your wife I run for you and me my friend I run for life It's a blur since they told me about it How the darkness had taken its toll And they cut into my skin and they cut into my body But they will never get a piece of my soul And now I'm still learning the lesson To awake when I hear the call And if you ask me why I am still running I'll tell you I run for us allDon't be afraid Close your eyes Lay it all down Don't you cry Can't you see I'm going Where I can see the sun rise I've been talking to my angel And he said that it's alright I've always had to run I don't know just why Desire slowly smoking Under the midwest sky But there's something waiting out there That says I've got to try I've been talking to my angel And he said that it's alright This town thinks I'm crazy They just think I'm strange Sometimes they want to own me Sometimes they wish I'd change But I can feel the thunder Underneath my feet Well I sold my soul for freedom It's lonely but it's sweet
