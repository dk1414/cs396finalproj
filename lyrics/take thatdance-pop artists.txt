I guess now it's time for me to give up I feel it's time Got a picture of you beside me Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup Got a fist of pure emotion Got a head of shattered dreams Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it I just want you back for good Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it You'll be right and understood I want you back for good Unaware but underlined I figured out this story It wasn't good But in the corner of my mind I celebrated glory But that was not to be In the twist of separation you excelled at being free Can't you find A little room inside for meStanding on the edge of forever At the start of whatever Shouting love at the world Back then we were like cavemen But we map the moon and the stars Then we forgave them We will meet you where the lights are The defendants of the faith we are When the thunder turns around they’ll run so hard we’ll tear the ground away You know no one dies In these love drowned eyes Through our love drowned eyes We’ll watch you sleep tonight Although no one understood We were holding back the flood Learning how to dance the rain We were holding back the flood They said we’d never dance againYou light the skies up above me A star so bright you blind me Don't close your eyes Don't fade away My heart, I know, now I’m losing you So pure, your love, so amazing, yeah yeah Don’t close your eyes Don’t fade away Don’t fade away Yeah, you and me, we can ride on a star If you stay with me girl, we can rule the world Yeah, you and me, we can light up the sky If you stay by my side, we can rule the world If walls break down, I will comfort you If angels cry, oh I'll be there for you You've saved my soul Don't leave me now Don't leave me now Yeah, you and me, we can ride on a star If you stay with me girl, we can rule the world Yeah, you and me, we can light up the sky If you stay by my side, we can rule the worldJust have a little patience I'm still hurting from a love I lost I'm feeling your frustration But any minute all the pain will stop Just hold me close inside your arms tonight Don't be too hard on my emotions'Cause I Need time My heart is numb, has no feeling So while I'm still healing Just try and have a little patience I really wanna start over again I know you wanna be my salvation The one that I can always depend I'll try to be strong Believe me, I'm trying to move on It's complicated but understand meYou, you're such a big star to me You're everything I wanna be But you're stuck in a hole And I want you to get out I don't know what there is to see But I know it's time for you to leave We're all just pushing along Trying to figure it out, out, out All your anticipation pulls you down When you can have it all You can have it all So come on So come on, get it on I don't know what you're waiting for Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey So come on See the light on your face Let it shine Just let it shine Let it shine Stop Being so hard on yourself It's not good for your health I know that you can change So clear your head and come 'round You only have to open your eyes You might just get a big surprise And it may feel good And you might want to smile, smile, smile Don't you let your demons pull you down Cause you can have it all You can have it allWe've come so far And we've reached so high And we've looked each day and night in the eye And we're still so young And we hope for more We've come a long way But we're not too sure where we've been We've had success We've had good times But remember this Been on this path of life for so long Feel I've walked a thousand miles Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love Everybody's been there With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of hope And I knew I could make it Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw My face in the moonlight Just then I realised what a fool I could be Just cause I looked so high I don't have to see me Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still There's a road going down the other side of this hillWe are giants, I can't believe it We were giants all along On the surface and all around us We are giants, we are strong I see you standing, see you dancing On the pavement, in the park We are giants, can you feel it So much bigger than we thought I think I might be heading out of body I've gotta love, you've gotta love somebody When I look in your eyes I'm bigger than the night sky As high as the sun, hard as a stone We are giants, we are giants We are giants There are giants across the water There are giants heading home In the middle of the madness There are giants being bornI guess now it's time for me to give up I feel it's time Got a picture of you beside me Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup Got a fist of pure emotion Got a head of shattered dreams Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it I just want you back for good Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it You'll be right and understood I want you back for good Unaware but underlined I figured out this story It wasn't good
