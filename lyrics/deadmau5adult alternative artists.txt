Happy life with the machines Scattered around the room Look what they made, they made it for me Happy technology Outside, the lions roam Feeding on remains We'll never leave, look at us, now So in love with the way we are Here, the world that the children made The world that the children made Here, the world that the children made Here, the world that the children made Every night, they rock us to sleep Digital family Is it real or is it a dream Can you believe in machines Outside, the beating sun Can you hear the screams We'll never leave, look at us, now So in love with the way we areDon't wake me up, I'm winning wars inside my head And maybe I'm weak, but not beneath the covers of this bed Asleep, I'm undefeated in this world of mine So, let me stay inside this dream and keep me from the light I've built this place, behind my eyes, you'll never see And you can move my body, but please keep my mind asleep Beyond the galaxies, where there's no space or time I will transform, I am reborn to rule over the skies I, I feel it in my bones Escape the world I know, it's all in my control I, I just wanna stay this way Blood pumping in my veins, I feel it, I feel it Behind the darkness, there's a sea of neon light And maybe you think I'm sinking, but you just can't get inside Don't try to save me when my mind is finally free'Cause I'd rather run my own world, than face your reality It's not enough for me to paint with black and white Inside my head, there are shades of red unknown to waking life You think you've traveled far  You've never seen the stars'Cause the only the way is if I say you can follow me that farI like the sound of the broken pieces I like the lights and the siren she says We got machines but the kids got Jesus We like to move like we both don't need this God can't hear you, they won't fight you Watch them build a friend just like you Morning sickness, X YZ Teenage girls with E SP Give me the sound to see Another world outside that's full of All the broken things that I made Just give me a life to bleed Another world outside that's full of All the awful things that I made We like to dance but the dead go faster Turn up the slam/hound/bar/code/blaster We want the cash or the junk you're after Rez-up control for the mixtape master Cell-correction, mass-dissection Death squad brats are in detention Morning sickness, X YZ Boys with bombs in N MA Carbon-lacing, spent shell-casings Photographs that I'm erasing Bonus lives with pixel-screams Girls with guns on L SD Cell infection, mass destruction Program for the final function Lab Rat King, rescue team Save me from the next lifeYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Ah, yeah Sparkle for me Sparkle for me Sparkle for me It’s shining like three seeds of pomegranates in my hands It’s just us that’s on this beach and all this sand All of this water I know but damn I know we ain’t supposed to touch it We only live once ma’am You said give it to me, give it to me, give it to me Then

heartbeats We’re being called to the other side, girl Lost in the vibe, we can’t sleep Our clothes off Feels so good inside, girlInside my head, there's a little place left for you What do you know What do you know And all I want is to find out what you're going through What do I know Maybe this silence is dangerous Inside my head, there's a little place left for you What do you know What do you know And feel what's inside you I wanna come over And see what you've found See if you're hurting After tearing me down It's the rain of denial It's the way that you're faking All the tears in your eyes Feels like I'm in slow motion TonightIt's been so long, I've been out of my body with you I feel alone, feel at home, feel like nothin' is true She took me to a place where my senses gave way Turnin' 'round, shuttin' down what the people say Climbin' up, killin' time, let 'em give you some Take my hand and let it come, let it come, let it Take it back where she knows that you're doin' it right'Cause everybody else knows what they're takin' tonight But I just wanna play it right We are gonna get there tonight It's been so far, I've been walkin' the line on my own Lift me up to the stars, we are comin' home I only had a taste, but we're out of time We are sold in the cold, physical design Set me free, set me out on the run Lift me up to the sun, to the sun, to the We are burnin' down, we are burnin' down It's the way that you fake it, I know it's too lateFuck drugs, I guess they don't work Tattooed body, I don't need no shirt Probably need Jesus, but I don't go church I'm on this hotel floor tryna soul search Pop a couple more, they won't hurt My mind or my body, which one'll go first Keep your weed, I don't smoke dirt Mine'll put you on your back like Goldberg Yes, yes, rock 'n roll, brother Got a face that was made for the Rolling Stone cover Gettin' money like a coke pusher My pockets lookin' like a skinny T-shirt on Bonecrusher On the road like Roadrunner Wait the food, and it look like her phone number She saw the pucka and then asked me if I would roll for her Want a hit of this, feels like a Stone Cold Stunner Legendary Legendary Legendary Legendary Eh Lexapros and a coffee cup Runnin' through the city like Forrest Gump Tried to give her draws and a proper skunk But she prefers the whites like Donald Trump Wish somebody would start poppin' up So I could put them on ice like a hockey puck Rap god, I catch a body like Bobby Wood You against Shotty's like Rocky boxing with Tommy Gunn What the fuck  Everybody turned Hollywood@ symbol, hashtag,

the death of a cynic I'ma be good, but just give me a minute Nowhere to go when I'm back at the wheel No one but me gives a **** how I feel So I’m gonna drive 'til I find a good meal And maybe then we'll talk for real I'm on the road to heaven knows where And I'm feeling okay, yeah, I'm feeling okay More, more, more, more, more, more, more More, more, more, more, more, more, more Tie your hair
