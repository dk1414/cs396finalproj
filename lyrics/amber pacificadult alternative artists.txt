I never dreamt it'd be this way I lost any chance for me to say To say that I miss you, say that I love you Will someone please tell me I'm okay I wasn't prepared for what's to come A life made of memories gone so young And now I'm regretting all I've done But in your heart you know that I'm with you all along Wherever you go, I will be waiting Whenever you call, I will be there Whatever it takes, I'll make your darkest days so bright I'm in your heart tonight I never thought that this could go And take me away from all I know And leave me to think I'm on my own But your love will take me, you were the one Who sat through nights You held me tight And made sure I'm okay And I thank you for the love you gave to meI'll hold a place for you and I Inside my heart for you and I I won't forget these tears I cried With every year that passes by And I can't sleep without you And I can't breathe anymore Good times last forever I'll keep my heart with yours For every minute I am gone Swear you'll never leave me I'll be there every time In your heart and in your eyes I'll give it up this time again Some things are better left unsaid And all I have are lasting dreams Our word's worth more this time it seems And I can't sleep without you And I can't breathe anymore Good times last forever I'll keep my heart with yours For every minute I am gone Swear you'll never leave me I'll be there every time In your heart and in your eyesThis is for the ones who believe their lives won't change Hoping that someday things will mend and be the same And this is for the ones who have lost it all and all that's left to gain Is a simple reminder that the things that were blind to slip away How can I say, say I'll be okay And if I fall through these days that go by without cause Just a painful mistake has left me here on my own And if I fall through these nights I can't seem to go on Just a sign that you're with me gives me the strength to hold on Now that the lines been broken I'm too afraid to just look back The pages have left an empty space You were all I had Why does it have to be this way These things they'll never change Still I'm left with knowing, content and happy, this is all I need And if I fall through these days that go by without cause Just a painful mistake has left me here on my own And if I fall through these nights I can't seem to go on Just a sign that you're with me gives me the strength to hold onThinking of the words to say I'd like to think that this was fate Reference to a song you love Spell confusion with a K Like a star without its strings I'm hanging here on these two wings For that smile and those eyes I'm falling If time could stop, how could I make this more poetic When there's nothing more pathetic to be said You bring me out, show me light I'm sorry if I hide, I'm too afraid to look inside You carry truth and make me smile If it were you and me tonight I would tame the stars and save the brightest one for you For you If you ever had the chance Would you make your life seem right Or would you only hold it back The good times, the hard, and the bad Whatever you say is alright Just as long as there's no doubt Could you look me in the eyes And say hopes diedI know it's not enough to say I'm wrong You know that I will miss you now you're gone I know it's not your life to see this through Just know that in my heart it beats for you So leave a little note for me behind I swear I have to know the reasons why This won't survive But if you fall back into my life I'd spend every night waking up to the beat I hear inside Telling me to be your only one But if you fall back into my life I promise you I would never let another day just pass us by I could never leave this world undone I wanna be your only one And now it's not the same with you away Just holding onto hope to save my days I won't survive So just stay with me tonight But if you fall back into my life I'd spend every night waking up to the beat I hear inside Telling me to be your only one But if you fall back into my life I promise you I would never let another day just pass us by I could never leave this war unsung I wanna be your only oneCan we make this last forever With every word we're growing distant And I feel as though I have to let you know It's growing old to see us torn by every choice that I have made In every instant you were right to write me off and move ahead And I think I let you down, I throw it all away I never meant to break it up or make you feel this way It's getting colder through these walls that seem too thin to break us now A perfect ending's still in line though it seems our time is running out Trace the call from you, we'll make this go away I never felt this day would come, I'll never be the same Can we make this last forever With every word you're growing distant And I feel as though I have to let you go Can we make this time together Seem as though we never started And it's hard to be the only one to know Through open eyes I sense a feeling painted black that lines your heart It's bleeding through just like the colors that I've seen right from the start And if I had the choice to do this all again Would you be inclined to notice it or would you just pretendHere we stand again Another day has passed us With its lack of change And all we have is what we share And all we want is someone else to be there And if the sun will set tonight Hold our secrets up to the sky As our shadows grow there's nothing left to hide And if you ever doubt You will know that I still wonder How many times did I compare The stars to your eyes We will make it through No matter the cost We've gone this far Why not find out how it works out For you and me We'll make it through I thought we were lost But somehow we haven't found a way And I hope that we never do It's hard to get to understand When all your lives in our hands And don't stop when you've never been closer Just 'cause you don't know what matters most So it won't always be so clearly right in front of usIf you only knew the pain The pain I keep inside The pain that makes me "me"Then without it who am I In a room with broken walls I lay in scene and dreams I want you to see I'm cold and white I'm holding on I'll try to breathe for you I'm crying out I'm singing loud You could be all I need And I'm losing my will Just to hold you in I'm giving up the hope That you could have been the one To save me from me And now our lips will meet And i'll taste their defeat I'll give in this onceSo why should I take your hand When you can't promise happy endings It's starting to get old That story that untold Reflect before we walk into What we already know Won't be so easy Looking back at high school drama Didn't try to fix what we thought were problems Done with writing empty letters Is there no other way Staring at your reflection every day Can make or break my heart away When you won't listen to what's hard for me to say Those tear stained eyes can make me feel so sad And once again we're further away from what we never had So why should I take your hand When you can't promise happy endings Just run away with so much left to share It's just not enough When we're so much more than friends We're much too young to throw away our caresIf only time could take away The truth that lies beneath this pain It brings me back to what I'd hope for this to be But here and now, I'm on my own I've lost the will to carry on Please shine a light to guide me home Will you take me from this place I call My home's forever broken I have nothing in this heart at all This life seems meaningless, unspoken Words can't convey I'll move on anyway I can't hide behind what I don't know Have I lost it all If only time could take away All the fights, the will to save What was left behind, you know I tried I tried to save this fate But here and now, I'm on my own For I have walked this road alone I gave my best to let this fall Will you take me from this place I call My home's forever broken I have nothing in this heart at all This life seems meaningless, unspoken Words can't convey I'll move on anyway I can't hide behind what I don't know Have I lost it all Have I lost it all
