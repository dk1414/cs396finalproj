she was 13 Her parents were too rich to do anything She rocked her way around L A'Til a New York Doll carried her away Look away Look away Now he was blond and she was dark They called him Thunder 'cause he had the spark The dream he dreamed was straight and pure But the confusion of life was gonna get him for sure Look away Look away They shared their clothes and their cowboy boots Left them all over the floor while they dyed their roots They live the dream and they went non-stop They did ok 'til the band broke up Look away Look away Look away Look awayGardenia Where are you Black goddess in a shabby raincoat Where are you tonight Cheap purple baby-doll dress A gardenia in your hair Much taller and stronger than me A forbidden dream, a dream, a dream All I wanna do is tell Gardenia What to do tonight All I wanna do is tell Gardenia What to do tonight Gardenia Where are you, tonight The streets were your home Now where do you roam Your hourglass ass And your powerful back Your slant devil eyes And the ditch on your spine Deep ass, deep assNightclubbing, we're nightclubbing We're what's happening Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing We're an ice machine We see people brand new people They're something to see Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing Oh isn't it wild Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing We're walking through town Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing We walk like a ghost We learn dances brand new dances Like the nuclear bomb When we're Nightclubbing Bright-white clubbing Oh isn't it wild I couldn't escape this feeling With my China girl I'm just a wreck without My little China girl I'd hear her heart beating Loud as thunder Saw the stars crashing I'm a mess without My China girl Wake up mornings There's no China girl I'd hear hearts beating Loud as thunder And I'd see stars crashing down I'd feel tragic Like I was Marlon Brando When I'd look at my China girl I could pretend that nothing Really meant too much When I'd look at my China girl I'd stumble into town Just like a sacred cow Visions of swastikas in my head And plans for everyone It's in the white of my eyes My little China girl You shouldn't mess with me I'll ruin everything you are I'll give you television I'll give you eyes of blue I'll give you men Who want to rule the world And when I get excited My little China girl says"Oh, Jimmy, just you shut your mouth"She says, "Shh"What happened to Zeke He's dead on Jones, man How about Dave O.D'd on alcohol Oh, what's Rock doing Oh, he's living with his mother What about James He's gone straight Well, things have been tough Without the Dum Dum Boys I can't seem to speak the language I remember how they Used to stare at the ground They looked as if they Put the whole world Looked as if they put The whole world down The first time I met the Dum Dum Boys I was fascinated They just stood in front of the old drug store I was most impressed No one else was impressed, not at all And we'd sing da, da, da, da, da, dum, dum, dayIt's a rainy afternoon in 1990 The big city Geez, it's been twenty years Candy, you were so fine Beautiful, beautiful girl from the North You burned my heart with a flickering torch I had a dream that no one

statement This job is a masquerade of recreation Like a wreck, I’m sinking fast The key to everything, I crawl for Sunday When I don’t have to move Caught up in dreams untangled one day Where I don’t have to prove The days roll on and finally Sunday A Sunday afternoon I've got it all, but what's it for But getting some more Always ready, always steady now Always ready, always steady now This street is as cold as a corporate lawsuit A pride, I won't chides telling me to wipe my boot I’m a wreck, what did you expect The key to everything, I crawl for Sunday When I don’t have to move Caught up in dreams untangled one day Where I don’t have to prove The days roll on and finally Sunday A Sunday afternoon I’ve got it all, and so what now
