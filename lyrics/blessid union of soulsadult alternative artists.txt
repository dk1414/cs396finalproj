She don't care about my car And she don't care about my money And that's real good 'cause I don't got a lot to spend But if I did, it wouldn't mean nothing She likes me for me Not because I look like Tyson Beckford With the charm of Robert Redford Oozing out my ears But what she sees Are my faults and indecisions My insecure conditions And the tears upon the pillow that I shed She don't care about my big screen Or my collection of D VD's Things like that just never mattered much to her Plus she don't watch too much T VAnd she don't care that I can fly her To places she ain't never been But if she really wants to go I think deep down she knows that All she has to say is whenBrother, my brother Tell me what are we fighting for We've got to end this war We should love one another Oh can't we just pretend This war never began We can try, brother, my brother We face each other from different sides The anger burns, can't remember why It's kinda crazy to cause such pain Our foolish pride makes us hate this way We watch our world fall apart Tell me what good is winning When we lose our heart Brother My Brother Tell me what are we fighting for Isn't life worth so much more We should love one another Oh can't we just pretend This war never began Tell me why, brother my brother We can try, brother my brotherI knew that this moment would come in time That I'd have to let go and watch you fly I know you're coming back so why am I dying inside Are you searching for words that you can't find Trying to hide your emotions but eyes don't lie Guess there's no easy way to say goodbye Chorus:I'll be standing at the edge of the earth Hoping that someday you'll come back again I'll be standing at the edge of the earth hoping for someday Someday Don't misunderstand what I'm trying to say I don't want to let you leave this way I want you to know that I'll stand right by your side And I know this may be The very last time that we see each other cry Whatever happens know that I'll...Chorus:I'll be standing at the edge of the earth Hoping that one day you'll come back again I'll be standing at the edge of the earth Hoping that someday you'll come back to me I'll be praying for whatever its worth Believing that one day you'll come back again I'll be standing at the edge of the earth Hoping for somedayWalk blindly to the light and reach out for his hand Don't ask any questions and don't try to understand Open up your mind and then open up your heart And you will see that you and me aren't very far apart'Cause I believe that love is the answer I believe that love will find the way Violence is spread worldwide and there's families on-the street And we sell drugs to children now oh why can't we just see That all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do today Money is our incentive now so that makes it okay But I believe that love is the answer I believe that love will find the way I believe that love is the answer I believe that love will find the way Ooooh I've been seeing Lisa now for a little over a year She said she's never been so happy but Lisa lives in fear That one day daddy's gonna find out she's in love With a nigga from the streets Oh how he would lose it then but she's still here with me'Cause she believes that love will see it through And one day he'll understand And he'll see me as a person and not just a black manSeems like yesterday, but years have passed us by Precious memories are clear before my eyes I can hear your voice calling out my name But I don't know you now, nothing stays the same And All along I have wanted you I pray tonight that you want me too All along there was no one else I've been waiting here all by myself If you were here with me, ride the ocean tide To that special place I held for you, deep inside I've kept good company since you've been away Lonely stayed with me, and pride began to fade And All along I have wanted you, I've wanted you I pray tonight that you want me too ooh All along there was no one else I've been waiting here all by myself All by myselfI can't remember the last time that we kissed goodbye All our "I love you"s were just not enough to survive Something your eyes never told me But it's only now too plain to see Brilliant disguise when you hold me And I'm free I've been thinking and here's what I've come to conclude Sometimes the distance is more than two people can use But how could I have known girl It was time and not space you would need Darling tonight I could hold you and you would know But would you believe There's a light in your eyes that I used to see There's a place in your heart where I used to be Was I wrong to assume that you were waiting for me There's a light in your eyes Did you leave that light burning for me Cards and phone calls and photograph pictures of you Constant reminder of all the things you get used to Is there a chance in Hell or Heaven That there's still something here to build on Or do you just pick up the pieces after they fall But after allWay over yonder Is a place that I know Where I can find shelter From hunger and cold And the sweet tasting good life Is so easily found Way over yonder That's where I'm bound I know when I get there The first thing I'll see Is the sun shining golden Shining right down on me Then trouble's gonna lose me Worry leave me behind And I'll stand up proudly In true peace of mind Talkin' bout a, talkin' bout a...Way over yonder Is a place I have seen In a garden of wisdom From some long ago dream May be tomorrow I'll find my way To the land where the honey runs In rivers each day And the sweet tasting good life Is so easily found Way over yonder - that's where I'm bound Way over yonder - that's where I'm boundAmy woulda died for me She woulda had my baby If I needed a favor, it was yes She never said maybe And all the times we walked barefoot in the sand Somehow we never felt the rain Now I got nothin' but time She's got her life and now I've got Nothing but mine I could walk off the hurt, run through the pain Wipe all the tears pouring down my face Deny the dream that just never was Oh, girl I just can't walk off the buzz Amy used to call me all the time But she hasn't lately I wonder if she goes out at all And if she's dating And every time I walk alone along the beach Somehow I always feel the rain So many times I wished for my space Now I wish I didn't feel so out of place I could walk off the feel, crawl through the hate Beg you to forgive my every mistake Pretend you and I just never was Oh, girl I just can't walk off this buzzI know you've heard the excuses before So I won't waste your time and I'll keep this short I've bound my emotions cause I can't afford to be wrong I know we've talked about being good friends So we've been real careful of the signals we've sent But all of your glances they came and they Went to my head And I'm not a man to throw words to the wind When I said "I loved you" that's what I meant And I plan to show you if it take me the Rest of my life The rest of my life Rest of my life I don't want to rush this cause my greatest fear Is taking for granted what's taken us years To build from the ground up with all of the tears that we've cried We've taken our time and for this I'm so glad Now we can be sure that this moment will last We've traveled a road of mistakes In our past to get here And I'm not about to throw words to the wind When I said "I love you" that's what I meant And I'm going to show you if it takes me The rest of my life The rest of my life The rest of my lifeHere we are we're on this ride to nowhere On this road to somewhere we have never been before We'll be all right As long as we're together We're like the little people from the little places All together searching for that bigger constellation You know we're all right As long as we're together What a union we could be if we just had the power What a moment we could seize in our finest hour Everything in time happens in this light Though our hands are tied We will still survive Well here we are and we've climbed the mountain Now we've seen the river but there's poison in the water Say it's all right If we just drink together Well we've seen the road and we've seen the signs Still we march in single file like cattle to the slaughter Yes it's all right As long as we're together
