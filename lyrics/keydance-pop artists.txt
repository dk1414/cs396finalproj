Some people live for the fortune Some people live just for the fame Some people live for the power, yeah Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things Define what's within And I've been there before, but that life's a bore So full of the superficial Some people want it all But I don't want nothin' at all If it ain't you, baby If I ain't got you, baby Some people

that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:'Tis the star-spangled banner — O long may it wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!And where is that band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion A home and a country should leave us no more!Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave New York City, please go easy on me tonight New York City, please go easy on this heart
