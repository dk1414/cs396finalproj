My sister My sister My sister I hate my sister, she's such a bitch She acts as if she doesn't even know that I exist But I would do anything to let her know I care But I am only talking to myself 'cause she isn't there My sister I love my sister, she's the best She's cooler than any other girl that I have ever met She had the greatest band, she had the greatest guy She's good at everything and doesn't even try She's got a wall around her nobody can climb She lets her ladder down for those who really shine I tried to scale it, but to me she's blind So I lit a firecracker, went off in my eye I miss my sister, why'd she go She's the one who would have taken me To my first all-ages show It was the Violent Femmes and the Del Fuegos Before they had a record out Before they went gold and started to growHe's a movie star, only drives rented cars Met him in a bar, said "I know who you are."Took him to my party as the games were starting Bottle's on the ground Are you ready now When it comes to me, I'm gonna be ready It's my turn in a minute, gonna put my message in it Five minutes in the closet with you He's in a bunch of movies, really stupid movies It's not entirely his fault, he can't control it all I am not afraid  I can hardly wait Truth or dare, I don't care Tell the truth I dare you When it comes around When it comes around Do you feel it too, what I feel for you If it was just us, would you do what I do He climbs on top in the dark And pushes your legs apart You grit your teeth try not to breathe Because he reeks of rotting meat He’s crushing you, he’s fucking huge His thick tongue slobbers across your face You wouldn’t call it a warm embrace It’s like being on a waterboard Sometimes you feel like such a whore Just close your eyes, try not to cry Give it up for the rhinoceros Guess who’s getting fucked by the rhinoceros Her name’s Melania She’s from slovenia An illegal immigrant He paid to sneak her in He likes them young, and compliant He rolls over and off of you And he lumbers across the room You go to the gilded bidet To wash the shit awayHe’s sweating heavily But she can’t feel the heat No electricity His ego’s so deflated His manhood’s so D-rated She’s so bored she falls asleep Short-fingered man Can’t get her off Short-fingered man Best give it up He claims he’s all the way in But she can’t feel anything He must be lying And with the business end It feels like nothing Is he even trying Short-fingered man Can’t get her off Short-fingered man Best give it up He’s easily hurt He’s very insecure You have to talk gently to him Like a little girl In a long dress shirt You can’t find his hands Now they’re lost in the pockets of his pantsWhat's that over there, moving on the wall A second glance and it's not there at all What's that sitting there on the page of my book It hides behind the words when I try to take a closer look I can't reach out and grab it But that's okay with me What's that jumping up and down in the middle of the street It lingers then it melts into the wavy liquid heat What are all those dizzy circles in the corner of my eye They laugh and float away as I look into the sky Can't get my arms around it But that doesn't bother me'Cause all I have to do is dream I see you every place I go I see you in people I don't even know I close my eyes and I see you I open 'em wide and I see you I see you Who am I to close my mind from what it wants to see And who are you to tell the truth, kill my fantasy Why are all those people always saying things about me I'm not a loser, I'm just lonelyShe was a virgin until you She was something to do She was a canvas ready to be painted full of misery and disease Sex and drugs Sex and drugs Sex and drugs Sex and drugs Sex and drugs Sex and drugs Sex and drugs Younger girls love to please She brings you chocolate chips to eat You have got such sweet teeth You lost a couple recently Sex and drugs Sex and drugs Sex and drugs Sex and drugs Sex and drugs Sex and drugs Sex and drugs You have done everything You are not touched by anything Not by longing, regret, or shame Or love or sun or rain Or sex and drugs Sex and drugs Sex and drugs Sex and drugs Or sex and drugs Sex and drugs Or sex and drugs Sex and drugs Sex and drugs Sex and drugs Sex and drugs Shall I see to my sister Made the magic grease Shall we meet on the hilltop Where the two roads meet We will form the circle Hold our hands and chant Let the great one know What it is we want Danger is great joy Dark is bright as fire Happy is our family Lonely is the ward Sister, we are waiting Come and meet in shame Fly fast throuth the airwaves Meet with pride and truth Danger is great joy Dark is bright as fire Happy is our family Lonely is the ward Father, we are waiting For you to appear Do you feel the panic Can you see the fear Night is draggin' her feet I wait alone in the heat I know, know that you'll have your way Until you have to go home"No" is a word I can't say But it gets me nowhere to tell you "no"And it gets me nowhere to make you go Will a little more love make you start depending Will a little more love bring a happy ending Will a little more love make it right Will a little more love make it right Where, where did my innocence go How, how was a young girl to know I'm trapped, trapped in the spell of your eyes In the warmth of your arms In the web of your lies But it gets me nowhere to tell you "no"And it gets me nowhere to make you go Will a little more love make you start depending Will a little more love bring a happy ending Will a little more love make it right Will a little more love make it rightBeauty can be sad You're proof of that When the damage is done You're damaged goods That's not to say it's not okay I wouldn't have it any other way A heart, a heart that hurts Is a heart, a heart that works A heart, a heart that hurts Is a heart, a heart that works Sweet, sweet pain comes with the sun Lie down and soak it up Burn off layers of insulators Exposed Nose to the cold I'm bleeding pretty colors Yeah, all over myselfI shut the windows and close the store I lay down on the bathroom floor Everyone I know is a bore I'm starting to think that everything stinks That I could really use a drink Then I got up and hit my head on the sink Father, Father, Father, Father Do you call Father, Father, Father Should I end it all Now, here comes the song I love so much Makes me wanna go fuck shit up Now, I got Nirvana in my head I'm so glad I'm not dead I slammed my hand in a car door I screamed 'till I could scream no more Bloody and mean and rotten to the core Father, Father, Father, Father Do you call Satan, Satan, Satan Should I end it all
