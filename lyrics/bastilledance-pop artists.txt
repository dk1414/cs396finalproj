Lately, I've been, I've been thinking I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier When the morning comes When we see what we've become In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind Not the fire that we've begun Every argument, every word we can't take back'Cause with all that has happened I think that we both know the way that this story ends Then only for a minute I want to change my mind'Cause this just don't feel right to me I wanna raise your spirits I want to see you smile but Know that means I'll have to leave Know that means I'll have to leave Lately, I've been, I've been thinking I want you to be happier, I want you to be happierEh, eheu, eheu Eh, eheu, eheu Eh, eheu, eheu Eh, eheu, eheu Eh, eheu, eheu Eh, eheu, eheu Eh, eheu, eheu Eh, eheu, eheu I was left to my own devices Many days fell away with nothing to show And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above But if you close your eyes Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all And if you close your eyes Does it almost feel like you've been here before How am I gonna be an optimist about this How am I gonna be an optimist about this “So, what would you little maniacs like to do first ”Watching through my fingers Watching through my fingers Shut my eyes and count to ten It goes in one ear out the other, oh One ear out the other, oh Burning bright right 'til the end Now you’ll be missing from the photographs Missing from the photographs Watching through my fingers Watching through my fingers In my thoughts you’re far away And you are whistling a melody Whistling a melody Crystallizing clear as day Oh I can picture you so easily Picture you so easilyWell I-I run the office and eh, tend the cabins and grounds and do little, eh errands for my mother  The ones she allows I might be capable of doing And do you go out with friends Well a-a boy's best friend is his mother A scrub is a guy who thinks he’s fly And is also known as a buster Always talkin’ about what he wants And just sits on his broke arse, so No, I don’t want your number No, I don’t want to give you mine and No, I don’t want to meet you nowhere No, I don’t want none of your time No, I don’t want no scrubs A scrub is a guy that can’t get no love from me Hangin’ out the passenger side Of his best friend’s ride Trying to holler at me I don’t want no scrubs A scrub is a guy that can’t get no love from me Hangin’ out the passenger side Of his best friend’s ride Trying to holler at me Trying to holler at me at me, at meIt was a slight on my honor, so he deserved it But we're talking about the most brilliant mind this world's ever seen I've got demons running round in my head And they feed on insecurities I have Won't you lay your healing hands on my chest Let your ritual clean Soak the ropes with your holy water Tie me down as you read out the words Set me free from my jealousy Won't you exorcise my mind Won't you exorcise my mind I want to be free as I'll ever be Exorcise my mind Help me exorcise my mind Desdemona, won't you liberate me When I'm haunted by your ancient history Close these green eyes and watch over as I sleep Through my darkest of dreamsWhen I watch the world burn All I think about is you When I watch the world burn All I think about is you There must be something in the Kool-Aid Cruising through the doom days God knows what is real and what is fake Last couple years have been a mad trip How'd y’all look so perfect You must have some portraits in the attic We'll stay offline so no one gets hurt Hiding from the real world Just don't read the comments ever, ever We fucked this house up like the planet We were running riot Crazy that some people still deny it Think I’m addicted to my phone My scrolling horror show I'm live-streaming the final days of Rome One tab along, it's pornographic Everybody's at it No surprise we're so easily bored Let's pick the truth that we believe in Like a bad religion Tell me all your original sins So many questionable choices We love the sound that our voice makes Man, this echo chamber's getting loud We're gonna choose the blue pill We’re gonna close the curtains We’re gonna rabbit hole down, third act love now She's gonna flip some tables I’m gonna move this tale on We're gonna rabbit hole down, third act love now We'll be the proud remainers Here 'til the morning breaks us We run away from real life thoughts tonight We’re gonna Peter Pan out Fade to the close-up, arms 'round We're gonna stay naive tonight, night, nightWhen you fall asleep with your head upon my shoulder When you're in my arms but you've gone somewhere deeper Are you going to age with grace Are you going to age without mistakes Are you going to age with grace Or only to wake and hide your face When oblivion is calling out your name You always take it further than I ever can When you play it hard and I try to follow you there It's not about control, but I turn back when I see where you go Are you going to age with grace Are you going to leave a path to trace When oblivion is calling out your name You always take it further than I ever can When oblivion is calling out your name You always take it furtherhan I ever canSo this is where we are It's not where we had wanted to be If half the world's gone mad The other half just don't care, you see You don't want to fuck with us British to the very last When it feels like the world's gone mad And there's nothing you can do about it No, there's nothing you can do about it When it feels like the world's gone mad And there's nothing you can do about it No, there's nothing you can do about it So tell me what's the news And what is it you want me to see We're lying to ourselves And dancing by the light of the screen You don't want to fuck with us British to the very lastAnd I don't think that that's a selfish want, I really don't  I'm not saying that I have this capacity because it's hard to develop that capacity on your own, when you're being stopped at every turn Drive around, night time, nowhere to go Melt me down, I'm like wax to your jokes Lost and found, knocking heads, laying low And there's no point reliving crimes to lose this Still wanna waste all of my time I wanna waste all of my time Still wanna waste all of my time I wanna waste all of my time With you Oh my lover, my lover, my love We can never go back We can only do our best to recreate Don't turn over, turn over the page We should rip it straight out Then let's try our very best to fake it Show me joy, flower through disarray Let's destroy, each mistake that we made Then restore the color back to the grey There's no pride in sharing scars to prove itIt's a quarter past midnight As we cut through the city Yeah, yeah, yeah, the streets are getting restless Good times, bad decisions Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a quarter past midnight And the sirens are mending some hearts But we're the losers on the back seats Singing "Love Will Tear Us Apart"It's a quarter past midnight Still avoiding tomorrow It's a quarter past midnight But we're just getting going We keep on running Running through a red light Like we're trying to burn the night away Away-way, oh, away-way, oh This is my favourite part, oh Help me piece it all together, darling Before it falls apart, oh Help me piece it all together
