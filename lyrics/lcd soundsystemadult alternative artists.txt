That's how it starts We go back to your house You check the charts And start to figure it out And if it's crowded, all the better Because we know we're gonna be up late But if you're worried about the weather Then you picked the wrong place to stay That's how it starts And so it starts You switch the engine on We set controls for the heart of the sun One of the ways that we show our age And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up If the sun comes up and I still don't wanna stagger home Then it's the memory of our betters That are keeping us on our feet You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan And the next five years trying to be with your friends again Oh, you're talking forty-five turns just as fast as you can Yeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend It comes apart The way it does in bad films Except the part Where the moral kicks in Though when we're running out of the drugs And the conversation's grinding away I wouldn't trade one stupid decision For another five years of life You drop the first ten years just as fast as you can And the next ten people who are trying to be polite When you're blowing eighty-five days in the middle of France Yeah, I know it gets tired, only where are your friends tonight Walking up to me expecting Walking up to me expecting words It happens all the time Present company excepted Present company except the worst It happens every night Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah Present company excluded every time Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah Present company, the best that you can find Talking like a jerk Except you are an actual jerk And living proof that sometimes friends are mean Present company expect it Present company, just laugh it off It's better than it seems Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah Present company excluded in every way Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah Present company, makes me wanna stay GoI wish that we could talk about it But there, that's the problem With someone new, I couldn't start it Too late for beginnings The little things that made me nervous Are gone in a moment I miss the way we used to argue Locked in your basement I wake up and the phone is ringing Surprised, as it's early And that should be a perfect warning That something's a problem To tell the truth, I saw it coming The way you were breathing But nothing can prepare you for it The voice on the other end The worst is all the lovely weather I'm stunned it's not raining The coffee isn't even bitter Because, what's the difference There's all the work that needs to be done It's late for revision There's all the time and all the planning And songs to be finishedYeah, I'm losing my edge I'm losing my edge The kids are coming up from behind I'm losing my edge I'm losing my edge to the kids from France and from London But I was there I was there in 1968 I was there at the first Can show in Cologne I'm losing my edge I'm losing my edge to the kids whose footsteps I hear when they get on the decks I'm losing my edge to the Internet seekers who can tell me every member of every good group from 1962 to 1978 I'm losing my edge To all the kids in Tokyo and Berlin I'm losing my edge to the art-school Brooklynites in little jackets and borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered Eighties But I'm losing my edge I'm losing my edge, but I was there I was there But I was there I'm losing my edge I'm losing my edge I can hear the footsteps every night on the decks But I was there I was there in 1974 at the first Suicide practices in a loft in New York City I was working on the organ sounds with much patience I was there when Captain Beefheart started up his first band I told him, "Don't do it that way  You'll never make a dime."I was there I was the first guy playing Daft Punk to the rock kids I played it at C BG B's Everybody thought I was crazy We all know I was there I was thereWake up with somebody near you And at someone else's place You took acid and looked in the mirror Watched the beard crawl around on your face Oh, the revolution was here That would set you free from those bourgeoisie In the morning everything's clearer When the sunlight exposes your age But that's okay And that's okay Grab your clothes and head to the doorway If you dance out, no one complains Find the place where you can be boring Where you won't need to explain That you're sick in the head and you wish you were dead Or at least instead of sleeping here you prefer your own bed, come on You just suck at self-preservation Versus someone else's pain So you feel drained And insane And insane He was leather and you were screaming Swinging chains against the stage And you couldn't know he was leaving But now more will go with age, you know So get up and stop your complaining You know that you're the only one who's been destroying all the fun Look what happened when you were dreaming Then punch yourself in the face So you kiss and you clutch but you can't fight that feeling That your one true love is just awaiting your big meeting So you never even asked for names You just look right through them as if you already came It's a drug of the heart and you can't stop the shaking'Cause the body wants what it's terrible at taking, oh And you can't remember the meaning But there's no going back against this California feelingNew York, I love you, but you're bringing me down New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down Like a rat in a cage, pulling minimum wage New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down New York, you're safer and you're wasting my time Our records all show you were filthy but fine But they shuttered your stores when you opened the doors To the cops who were bored once they'd run out of crime New York, you're perfect, oh, please don't change a thing Your mild billionaire mayor's now convinced he's a king And so the boring collect, I mean all disrespect In the neighborhood bars I'd once dreamt I would drink New York, I love you, but you're freaking me out There's a ton of the twist, but we're fresh out of shout Like a death in the hall that you hear through your wall New York, I love you, but you're freaking me out New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down Like a death of the heart, Jesus, where do I start But you're still the one pool where I'd happily drownTell me a line, make it easy for me Open your arms Dance with me until I feel all right It's good in the dark, good in the dark But into the lover's light Here comes another fight So ring the alarm, ring the alarm Bore me and hold me and cling to my arm Here it comes, here it comes And what you're asking me now, disastrous now Hoping and hoping and hoping The feeling goes away Never change, never change, never change, never change Never change, never change, never change This is why I fell in love Never change, never change, never change, never change Never change, never change, never change That's just who I fell in love with Oh this is the time, the very best time So give me a line and take me home Take me over But dashing the hopes dashing the hopes And smashing the pride The morning's got you on the ropes And love is a murderer, love is a murderer But if she calls you tonight Everything is all right Yeah, we know And love is a curse shoved in a hearse Love is an open book to a verse of your bad poetry And this is coming from meOh baby Oh baby You're having a bad dream Here in my arms Oh sugar You came to me Could all be a bad thing Doing you harm Oh oh oh Oh lover You run from me We move like a bad scene Shot in the dark Oh, but please Please wake me But my love lies patiently Please baby, please And my love life waits for meHome Home Home Home Home Home Take me home Just do it right Make it perfect and real Because it's everything Though everything was never the deal So grab your things and stumble into the night So we can shut the door And shut the door on terrible times, oh Yeah, do it right And head again into space So you can carry on And carry on, and fall all over the place This is the trick, forget a terrible year That we can break the laws Until it gets weirdEverybody's singing the same song It goes "tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight"I never realized these artists thought so much about dying But truth be told we all have the same end Could make you cry, cry, cry, cry, cry But I'm telling you This is the best news you're getting all week Oh sure it's ruling the airwaves Or what remains of the airwaves And we're frankly thankful for the market psychology you're hipping us to And all the hits are saying the same thing There's only tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight And life is finite But shit, it feels like forever It feels like forever Oh is everybody feeling the same stuff We're all wild Except for you And you know who you are This is a love song And you're getting older I promise you this; you're getting older And there's improvements unless You're such a winner That the future's a nightmare And there's nothing I can do Nothing anyone can do about this
