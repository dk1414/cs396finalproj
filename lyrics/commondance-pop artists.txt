lies, killers immortalized We got arms but won't reach for the skies Waiting for the Lord to rise, I look into my daughter's eyes And realize I'ma learn through her The Messiah might even return through her If I'ma do it, I gotta change the world through her Furs and a Benz, Gramps wantin 'em Demons and old friends, Pops, they hauntin' him The chosen one from the land of the frozen sun Where drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones Walk like warriors, we were never told to run Explored the world to return to where my soul begun Never looking back, or too far in front of me The present is a gift, and I just wanna be Yeah You know they be asking ’bout Common, where he at What that man doing now I’m doing what I do, hip-hop That's what I do Yeah How can I say this, fuck it I’m
