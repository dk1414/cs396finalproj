]You ain't got no future You ain't got no future You ain't got no future You ain't got no future You can feel the damage from the sonics Honestly I just drop shit to watch 'em panic, the awkward Moment they meet the prophet they know they can't profit off of Can't even capture the monstrous flow, they call me Loch Ness I'm a sonata suicide bomber honored to take the track to God with me Thoughts get odder than Rob Ripley I stop bein' suprised when I realize They just tryna hold you down to capitalize like the shift key Fuck, go head and miss me, you claimin' it's tight But maybe on your next shot, make sure your're aimin' this right The current tryna pull me under but I won't take that dive Feelin' like fuck ridin' the wave, I'd rather battle the tide Cause I'm, the rap precog, to de-clog Your weed-logged vision thinkin' that you gon' be on Just listen, we all know that the truth hurts So here's a tip, just admit you ain't got no futureWill we ever be together, like we always said we would Mrs  "I Don't Love You" like I thought I did This ain't what I'm used to What about the kids They don't understand us Or what I thought we were We're just not the same us What we were before, Mrs  "I Don't"I used to love this bitch But now I'm worried I'mma end up in court Telling the jury how the glove don't fit It's kinda strange how we can change From having love so quick To me hating yours guts Like that's the reason that we in this shit What you gave birth to unearthed a whole world of numbness It's amazing, I can't even feel that craving that I used to get So when I hit the pavement, pacing where this used to live I'll make the aftershock shock the kids until the basement shift You might be missing this, so here's some blatant shit Fuck baby mom, she on some old "Just pay me cause I'm makin' this"Rubbing her tummy like it's bringing home the bacon Bitch what happened to the love that came above all when we made this shit But now the tables shift, no not the 1200s But for 1200 she'll let you take what you want and just dip It's hard to come to grips I used to love fucking her But now I fucking love hearing her, how she dumb as shitWe've been holding this up for years and ya'll can't even raise your hands Like you in class embarrassed in front of your peers I'm done dumbing it down son, the sound you hear Was designed to avoid leaving a void between your ears And while they toying with my fears I be destroying every stage that I stand on And planned on this as my career Except it seems that no matter where my dreams at with these cats It's more about a fad than a fan that can hear The true meaning, I've been through feuds with a few demons Leaving worn down souls/soles like shoes leaning Believe it You semen/see men spit like hoes without the kleenex And then wonder why the seeds hit the cement Out in the street with nobody to teach kids Stop buying that weak shit support something decent I preach this And each and every time you reach for a record Be sure you check for the B-B-A-S bitch respect it They ain't listening I grip the pen tight and write till blisters end the session Sending tension up my tendons just to represent I've gotten ill at this, I don't mean that I'm nice I mean I've literally gotten sick from staying up nights Just trying to write and make beats for weeks at a time He's tight but he can't speak over beats when he's dying And it's trying his emotions that nobody know his name He's just in it for the rent and utilities fuck the fame It's a shame how you put your love in to something so much it sucks The best you get is independent spins for a couple months Before you bumped talking bout all the things in your past But Andre told me boy you only funky as your last cut And that's what keep me running like I got a target on my back cuz One track won't last for the masses ask us Where we gonna be in a few I tell them I don't know but this what flows when I thought of you{L EA VE M E A LO NE}Yeah, Guilty Simpson sayin what up to The Audible Doctor What's poppin, leave me alone man Leave me alone, when you see me walking up the block And you wanna say peace don't stop just Leave me alone, when you see me chillin in the spot And you wanna say what up just stop Leave me alone A blunt and a microphone and I'm straight I treat the place like it's home And relax and body tracks with second nature With a flavor better than a life savor The squad reacts with force When a hater wanna play a rhyme sayer like dirt ain't me For that I say R.I.P A fatal mistake, the dope man owe money we take it in weight Then we taking the block Catch me at a random spot, overseas I don't travel on the land a lot Blowing trees sprinkling green grams of pot Low key paranoid duck camera shots Never catch me with the stacks on E My gun tatt M Cs like Kat Von D So we should all pray that I win It's either this or picking up the heater once againThe beast on beats slanging this heat, with street slang and it's deep Retreat playing ain't me, it's peace or hanging them see Deceased dangling from trying to tangle with me Angling for change for chains, Django in this bitch I'm free You don't want mine Record into the boards and leave them more shook than an epileptic upon a fault line I cause rhymes to enter your mental cavity Rattling your brain if you feeling insane enough to battle me what Another casualty is nothing leave them slain I came to dead everything and leave them suffering in shame For even bluffing that the name Audible's nothing to the game Caught a few fronting leave them laying for cutting out of their lane Fuck the fame of this, I been recording since before you were nameless Got the nerve to kick the console to watch the game shift The aim's sick something we don't play with Audible and Bumpy the beast bumping through tape decks what The beast back in this bitch So ease back 'fore it kicks With these tracks you get hit To teach rap to the kids The beast back in this bitch So ease back 'fore it kicks Uh, the beast back yeah The beast back in this bitch what Baby if the cake ain't missing How'd that icing get all over you, you girl You're the biggest chocolate covered liar, I've ever seen Ohh was it good good girl From sweet nothings to nothing sweet Reality always comes down to what you really wanna believe Deceit, too easy when you're busy looking for religion Turned a blind eye to wise guys searching for a victim They'll feed you anything, a diet of lies Designed to slowly bleed you out until they're left with everything Some cat's will make the metal sing I'm more the type to constrict my inner circle to prevent you cat's from entering So what's your word worth Stock is plummeting these days and seeds stay eating what these birds chirp Whatever's heard first assumed as fact I'm screaming fuck the face value I need deeper than that What seeps through the cracks is often where the deepness is at I put my thesis to the track and watch the people react You be misleading to attract but all y'all preaching is wack Deceiving your people with d'evils diseasing the factsNow I'm flying, flying I'm flying, flying Yeah yeah don't even try to ask me when I'm coming down People asking "what you gonna do if all this music flop "Well what's a chain wallet to you if your belt loop pop It's all or nothing, lame cats fall for nothing I'm soaring higher than a herpe on the balls of a puffin I mean I'm flyer than what's perching on a pile of rubbish Don't dumb it down for the public they'll smarten up when it's done with And in the meantime, I spend free time with what I love And it's because it gets me higher than a buzz from a drug This not a part that I'm playing this is a part that's Ingrained inside of me in dire need of release See some cats attracted to plain some cats attracted to flame But at the end of the day I'm tracking the beat He's deep as a whale sings and slicker than snail streams Forgotten like failed dreams but richer than veiled schemes To capture the kings queen and get in between While the rest don't leave the nest I'm not afraid to fly with frail wingsUnderdog Underdog This one nation under god got me playing underdog Got my people up in arms, but I ain't sweating barely sweating in my underarms I ain't even trying to even odds They call us monkeys everybody's talking bout being fly Guess we a bunch of flying monkeys this ain't even Oz And why we fighting this ain't even ours Far as I can see it's all a farce at least that's what it's been so far They wanna see the legends fall, but we the legend of the fall Underdogs by nature for seeing straight through the alleged nature of it all It's gonna take some patients though is all And a little more time to build my reputation but all in all it's a ball Especially because all of ya'll is involved Peace x2 Somebody told me if this the way of the world we all sinning Doc walk through flames to leave y'all engulfed in them Doc walk through flames and leave y'all engulfed in them Doc walk through flames..  x2 I think they Andy Kaufman, big Latka Making millions while they fucking up the game proper Can't be real with that shit you saying you must be playing The whole world in a hoax folks fucking for payment I'm agitated they fabricated like Tony Clifton But got enough folks willing to fold and throw their chips in The whole mission to trick the whole system Assisted by those missing the point like broke scissors Bitch you sloppy in the cut like they fixed it with no stitches Yeah we all stars but not the type that you wanna wish on Calling all cars Doc just went rouge the globe's shifting To a climate where they won't rewind it more inclined to skip it Shit it's not a hobby this is my world and I'm bobby Probably big wheel on you hoes no deal bitch call me Howie How he kicking all these flows for real he sounding godly Probably cuz he eating sloppy cats for lunch like salami I'll be waiting in the wings while you waiting in the lobby Never signed a deal to win cuz I know it ends in robbery Obviously you gotta be properly prepared to rock with me These new cats just hit the lottery and make a mockerySay what you want want But I never front front No need to play dumb dumb Mother fucker I'm genuine It is what it is is Misleading the kids kids I'm just trying to live live Fuck that yo I'm genuine Say what you want want But I never front front No need to play dumb dumb Mother fucker I'm genuine It is what it is is Misleading the kids kids I'm just trying to live live Fuck that son I'm People asking how I'm still breathing when releasing my soul I'm on my deathbed breathing life to each of these notes And when I'm dead I bet you justify your life by my quotes But it won't change the fact you lack the qualities you promote bitch I concoct this dope shit to flood when my flow hits Except instead of nodding out they nod to my drum kicks I'm done with those that pose instead of taking a stance I practice mastering my craft you shopping for clothes bitch I flow on like lords of the under under a fountain I'm the mailer daemon in your box the way I keep it bouncing A battle similar to trying to scale a mountain Staying genuine in a sea of fake emcees while they shouting How he sound so clean on top a beat that's so grimy I'm obsessed I don't write I possess the beat till words find me And I've never been impressed by the next man's shine see I glow from within through my skin the light's blinding what
