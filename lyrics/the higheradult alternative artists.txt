Go, Do what we know, don't go You move we don't---now go Now don't you move we won't go now don't go go I like the way that you move meant the way that she tasted Like to rip these things right through her lips Contemplating experience that left me here This intoxicating kiss But tonight, I'm setting all my memories aside So why don't we trace the footsteps back into our past with the ones we've lost Too many bad mistakes were made No one should have to take the fall for it when it's our life to live Go, Do what we know, don't go You move we don't---now go Now don't you move we won't go now don't go go I like the way that he moved found out the way that he tasted Then he ripped these things right from her lips Never thinking the first time that they met would be the last she saw of him Is clever an issue, a balancing reason Are we all waiting to destroy The things in life we are made of a blessing were tasting We've come so far to recreate We'd like to build the expansion resembling patterns Disguising everything and what we have to relive And this all for this one danceSlide with me, now, down that purple shaft into the deep, inner depths of the diamond mine where we will witness the flight of the precious peanut butter fudge angel of love as she spreads her wings and flies high through the thundering silence of your vacuum-kept secret hiding out on the pulsating fringe of your bubbly, fudge mind Deep  In the sanctuary of the ruby-lipped lizard who's tripped through that revolving door of today's changes springs the weightless suspension of those tiny, red question marks to pierce your brain and taunt you to observe the wondrous smoke of the fur-lined volcano near the cave of the great blue-winged bat, following the flight of the deep, deep breathing butterfly towards the soothing smell of the six-foot narcissus Are we in the garden of man-eating dandelions or in the safety of the Tasmanian Tree House  Can it be  Will it be  Yes it will as you reach out for where it's at only to find when you're where it's at, it isn't where it's at at all  So pop out now with me for a borrowed moment and glimpse through the plate glass menagerie of life that time feeds  The flight of mediocrity!Will we ever free ourselves of the demons of mediocrity Wait now with me, knee-deep in the splendor of the peach-fuzz forest in the gentle radiation of the one-eyed puffling who joins us on our ball-bearing express to the land of lavender and sky blue pink where we pause on the latex trampoline of tomorrow's promise and grieve on yesterday's sweet sorrow In the steam-heated living room of the warm teenage tangerine, we must now somersault in slow-motion Down—down the sliding board to a diamond mine eternity Crying—crying, "is God alive "And remembering so well that the hand that cradles the rock can certainly..  roll the worldGo, Do what we know, don't go You move we don't---now go Now don't you move we won't go now don't go go I like
