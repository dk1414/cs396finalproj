She sees them walking in a straight line, that's not really her style And they all got the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind Nothing in this world could ever bring them down Yeah, they're invincible, and she's just in the background And she says I wish that I could be like the cool kids'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in I wish that I could be like the cool kids Like the cool kids He sees them talking with a big smile, but they haven't got a clue Yeah, they're living the good life, can't see what he is going through They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where they're going In the fast lane, living life without knowing And he says I wish that I could be like the cool kids'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in I wish that I could be like the cool kids Like the cool kids I wish that I could be like the cool kids'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to get it I wish that I could be like the cool kids Like the cool kidsI think the universe is on my side Heaven and earth have finally aligned Days are good and that's the way it should be You sprinkle stardust on my pillow case It's like a moonbeam brushed across my face Nights are good and that's the way it should be You make me sing, "Ooh"La la la You make a girl go, "Ooh"I'm in love, love Did you see that shooting star tonight Were you dazzled by the same constellation Did you and Jupiter conspire to get me I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right'Cause now I'm shining bright, so bright Bright, so bright And I see colors in a different way You make what doesn't matter fade to grey Life is good and that's the way it should beOver my head, over my head, over my head Over my head, over my head, over my head There's only static on T V in this hotel room Reminds me of all the things you think I don't understand It seems like you and me, we keep losing connection Whenever you talk to me, it doesn't make any sense Don't know what you meant, it's always over my head Yeah, over my head Yeah, it's so Over my head, over my head, over my head Over my head, over my head, over my head Is it too late, too far gone to fix this Over my head, over my head, over my head Over my head, over my head You take the simplest thing and always complicate it Talking in circles, got me dizzy like a merry-go-round It shouldn't be so hard to have a conversation I'm sick of fighting with your ego, I wish you would admitTry not to let the burn become a scar What's left of me is only broken parts You take the pretty and color it dark My only grievance is a broken heart When you finally find yourself Tell him I said, tell him I said When you finally find yourself Tell him I said, tell him I said"Goodbye""Goodbye"You're riding paper airplanes, can't see the string You cover up the poison with poetry You traded roses and left me sorry My only grievance is a broken dream When you finally find yourself Tell him I said, tell him I said When you finally find yourself Tell him I said, tell him I said"Goodbye""Goodbye""Goodbye""Goodbye"Tell her a story Tell her the honest truth You treat her better Make sure to see it through Don't be just everything she wants Be everything she needs When she says she loves you Tell her you love her too Oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh Give her a reason A reason to love all you do She'll tell you secrets You'll tell her secrets too She'll tell you all her hopes and dreams You'll tell them too When she says she loves you Tell her you love her too Tell her you love her too But don't you run away, run away When you get tired'Cause this will slip away, slip away And start a fire That can never be put out Oh, hurry, time is running out But don't you run away, run away Before you tell her you love herDear world, I'm writing this song for you Dear world, I know what you're going through I know you're scared about tomorrow, scared of feeling hollow I am too Dear world, I'm writing this song for you Dear world, you ain't all that I thought you would be A few trips ago 'round the sun I'm trying to find out what it means to be me I feel like I've barely begun How many souls can be crowded together And all of us feeling alone All of us longing for hope All of us longing for hope Dear world, I'm learning to wait for change Dear world, your beauty is born from pain You're looking for the magic to rise above the tragic I am too Dear world, I'm writing this song for you Dear world, you ain't all that I thought you would be A few trips ago 'round the sun I'm trying to find out what it means to be me I feel like I've barely begun How many souls can be crowded together And all of us feeling alone All of us longing for hope All of us longing for hope All of us longing for hope Dear worldOut of the blue, you changed your mind Nothing's new, I didn't change mine We used to dance under the moonlight We used to laugh at the same time You swore we'd never stop dancing You felt all the same feelings Remember those feelings Say, I'll be your girl forever Stay, we're meant to be together Wait, this song won't last forever We're meant to be together Innocence and promises Broken hearts and no regrets So say, stay, wait...for me Our summer nights were like a dream This L.A  life got me thinking We used to talk, now our phones ring Both got annoyed by the same thingsThe future me I haven't met There's some things you might regret Like giving up on love too fast Chasing shadows from your past Future me I haven't met There's gonna be some pain It's good to feel something Right now, I'm already who I wanna be tomorrow Who I wanna be tomorrow is who I am Right now, I'm already who I wanna be tomorrow Who I wanna be tomorrow is who I am Right now Right now They don't know you like I do They don't know what you've been through They're hands up black and blue For never letting go of you They don't know you like I doBeen driving all night It's stuck in my mind Running through lights All I can find Is lonely in a crowded room But I don't wanna leave too soon In case I miss someone like you Lay out my goodbyes I'm done for the night Saw you outside Had the look in your eyes Falling in a deep unknown Getting late, I have to go I can't leave, I have to know Get into my car, get into my life Get into my heart, you know what I like Come give me something that I won't know how to live without I don't wanna miss and I can't let this get past me now You figure me out They're talking me down Your love is so loud And it's drowning them out Voices in my head again Where you start is where they end Now they're gonna wanna let you live, yeahAnd I, I tend to be my own worst enemy And I, I linger on everything But I find when I'm alone, it gets so hard to breathe And I, I, and I Shouldn't apologize for just existing Shouldn't apologize for just being me Trying to hide behind all my distractions Okay 'til the quiet comes When it all dies down, it gets so loud All the voices in my head Just try to fill me up with doubt I'm learning how to turn around All the voices in my head I think I found my favorite sound I think I found my favorite sound Oh, I think I found my favorite sound Do you take the time to recognize yourself Do you spin like a carousel I want you to know that it's okay to ask for help We all need help, we all need help
