I could tell you all the things I do for you But it's no surprise and you just roll your eyes and say"Here we go again, she's gonna moan again"I should spare your love, just a thing or two But you don't disguise it when I'm just white noise And it's done before it begins'cause your temper's getting thin But there's just one thing that I wanna know Just one little thing before I go Before I go It's who takes care of me Tell me who takes care of me Should've been you Should've been you Do you realize  No you never will'cause your head's held high and you got your pride I got a little of mine still Yeah, the bit you couldn't kill I'll never blame you and I always will I can't explain it but it hurts like Hell And I'm feeling so alone Yeah, I'm lonely to the boneBlack tears One will fall for every good year Inside I'm dying Outside I'm crying black tears Your kiss killed me on that night As your lips left a bitter taste And inside I'm dying Outside I'm crying black tears How did it all go wrong We seemed to have it all But it's broken And I'm running And I'm scared So I pray to God above It's a sin when we don't love It's so quiet Can you hear me Are you there Black tears Please be gone so I can see clear Keep calm and carry on But inside I'm dying Outside I'm crying black tearsGetting one kiss closer to kill My resistance to your kind of thrill And your lips let me know that you're real Can't commit this crime, can't ignore You got my love-stained heart on the floor So I surrender, can't take it no more I got a sixth sense, baby 'bout you and me I pretend not to wanna but it's haunting me at night and day, yeah I got a sixth sense, baby 'bout you and me I'm damned if I show it but I can't shake this feeling away Just can't shake it away When you touch me rub-a-dub-dub You got my mind in the gutter of love Down on my knees, I can't get enough I swear I saw you once in a dream Jumped out a window, we kissed in the sea And we were good, in my fantasy I got a sixth sense baby 'bout you and me I pretend not to wanna but it's haunting me at night and day, yeah I got a sixth sense baby 'bout you and me I'm damned if I show it but I can't shake this feeling away Just can't shake it awayTried to resist you but I couldn't Tried not to kiss you, knew I shouldn't But I was weak for you You got to me Thought I was strong, oh how I was wrong How bad can a good girl be Your breath on my neck as you thrilled me A leg to caress nearly killed me I was in need of you You felt my need Thought I was strong, oh how I was wrong How bad can a good girl be An ancient voice escaped my mouth And it screamed out a primal pleasure My spirit soul my animal Came together in every measure Of life, of love Of flesh, of blood Of you May God forgive my indiscretion But I gotta admit, hear my confession I wanna peak with you, feel you in meMy heart is thumpin' inside of my chest My temple is burnin' and drippin' with sweat My mind is spinnin' yeah swimmin' around My tongues dried up like I've been lickin' the ground It's the longing The longing for you It's the longing The hole in my chest it twists like a knife Takin' over my body, takin' over my life I can't think of nothin', no one else gonna do I'm haunted by the living, yeah, wantin' you It's the longing The longing for you It's the longing The longing for you It's the longing The longing for you It's the longing The longing for youThought I was over, I was at the end Thought I was done with my heart Then I met you and it could beat again Each pulse a second start You kissed my dying mouth My blood began to warm My life was running out But I was hoping to be reborn I levitate towards you And the way that you move I rise to the occasion of a dream come true Don't hesitate when I do Don't be afraid of the mood Thought it was too late but now I levitate towards you Thought I was dreaming, are you really mine You must be to good to be true Fought all my demons then to find divine Is ever the sweeter, mon chou So dance me to the stars And lend me your caress Hold me in your heart Then I can die of happinessI'm a fallen angel, don't wanna be somebody's saint I've tarnished my halo and my specialty is to take But I want you to think of me as better than the rest I've chased away my demons but i'm human at my best So come adore me, but know I'm gonna fall Off of this pedestal that I hope you've put me on And as God's above me, I swear I'll try to be All that you ever want and I'll be the best of me I wanna be your human If you could just believe in me the way I believe in you Your world would be just heavenly With our words, we'd speak the truth So lie down here beside me and we'll gaze up at the stars Even they can fall sometimes, but they're perfect as they are So come adore me, but know I'm gonna fall Off of this pedestal that I hope you've put me on And as God's above me, I swear I'll try to be All that you ever want and I'll be the best of me I wanna be your

You had to run away You headed to the door I counted to one And you were back for moreOnce upon a time A Dublin girl ran free Down the cobblestones Round pubs and homes As rich as she could be Swimming in the Irish Sea Climbing up Bray Head Her lips were warmed With pots of tea Chips and buttered bread Fed love from Mam and Da They raised her up They made her fly They gave her roots and wings As time moves on and years go by She'll miss those simple things She's the girl I used to be The playgrounds all came down And we mourned our factories Times were tough, but I had enough I had my family Life kicked in with all its might But my strong heart wouldn't break I got kicked around and broken down I took all that I could take
