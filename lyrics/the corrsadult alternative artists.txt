breathless Come on, come on, come on Hey, yeah The daylight's fading slowly But time with you is standing still I'm waiting for you only The slightest touch and I feel weak I cannot lie From you, I cannot hide And I'm losing the will to try Can't hide it Can't fight it So go on, go on Come on, leave me breathless Tempt me, tease me Until I can't deny this Loving feeling Make me long for your kiss Go on , go on Yeah, come on YeahI haven't slept at all in days It's been so long since we have talked And I have been here many times I just don't know what I'm doing wrong What can I do to make you love me What can I do to make you care What can I say to make you feel this What can I do to get you there There's only so much I can take And I just got to let it go And who knows I might feel better, yeah If I don't try and I don't hope What can I do to make you love me What can I do to make you care What can I say to make you feel this What can I do to get you there No more waiting, no more Aching No more fighting, no more Trying Maybe there's nothing more to say And in a funny way I'm calm Because the power is not mine I'm just gonna let it flyI read the book you read, tasted the words you said Our story is darkening with time One fading afternoon The leaves dried in your car, no picture understood But I had a feeling I would find, you hid it all from me And I'll miss you forever Let's hope we've always summer Yeah bring on the night, I don't care Turn on the dark, I'm not scared Spirit money to a flame Ask that I'll see you again Yeah bring on the night, I don't care Turn on the dark, I'm not scared Wherever it is you left me behind I'll follow you down the path of my broken heart Flowers on Edith Grove, wilt like a love note Every day I'm passing by, I say a little prayer And I'll miss you forever Let's hope we've always summer Yeah bring on the night, I don't care Turn on the dark, I'm not scared Spirit money to a flame Ask that I'll see you again Yeah bring on the night, I don't care Turn on the dark, I'm not scared Wherever it is you left me behind I'll follow you down the path of my broken heartI haven't slept at all in days It's been so long since we have talked And I have been here many times I just don't know what I'm doing wrong What can I do to make you love me What can I do to make you care What can I say to make you feel this What

funny way I'm calm Because the power is not mine I'm just gonna let it flyI'm not looking for someone to talk to I've got my friends, I'm more than ok I've got more than a girl could wish for I live my dreams but it's not all they say Still I believe I'm missing something real I need someone who really sees me Don't want to wake up alone anymore Still believing you'll walk through my door All I need is to know it's for sure Then I'll give all the love in the world I've often wondered, if love's an illusion Just to get you through, the loneliest days I can't criticize it, I had no hesitations My imagination, just stole me away Still I believe I'm missing something real I need someone who really sees meNow here you go again, you say you want your freedom Well who am I keep you down It's only right that you should play the way you feel it But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness Like a heartbeat drives you mad In the stillness of remembering what you had And what you lost Yeah, thunder only happens when it's raining Players only love you when they're playing Yeah, women they will come and they will go When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions I keep my visions to myself Well, it's only me that wants to wrap around your dreams And have you any dreams you'd like to sell Dreams of loneliness Like a heartbeat drives you mad In the stillness of remembering what you had And what you lostI've seen this place a thousand times I've felt this all before And every time you call I've waited there as though you might not call at all I know this face I'm wearing now I've seen this in my eyes And though it feels so great, I'm still afraid That you'll be leaving anytime We've done this once and then you closed the door Don't let me fall again for nothing more Don't say you love me unless forever Don't tell me you need me if you're not gonna stay Don't give me this feeling, I'll only believe it Make it real or take it all away I've caught myself smiling alone Just thinking of your voice And dreaming of your touch is all too much You know I don't have any choice Don't say you love me unless forever Don't tell me you need me if you're not gonna stay Don't give me this feeling, I'll only believe it Make it real or take it all awayYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah We are taking it easy and bright and breezy, yeah We are livin' it up just fine and dandy, yeah And it really doesn't matter that we don't eat And it really doesn't matter if we never sleep No it really doesn't matter, really doesn't matter at all Cause we are so young now, we are so young, so young now And when tomorrow comes we can do it all again We are chasing the moon just running wild and free We are following through every dream and every need And it really doesn't matter if we don't eat And it really doesn't matter if we never sleep No it really doesn't matter, really doesn't matter at all Cause we are so young now, we are so young, so young now And when tomorrow comes we can do it all again Yeah we are so young now, we are so young, so young now And when tomorrow comes, we'll just do it all again All again, all again, yeah, all again, all again, yeah.. You're only just a dreamboat Sailing in my head You swim my secret oceans Of coral blue and red Your smell is incense burning Your touch is silken yet It reaches through my skin Moving from within And clutches at my breast But it's only when I sleep See you in my dreams Got me spinning round and round Turning upside down But I only hear you breathe Somewhere in my sleep Got me spinning round and round Turning upside down But it's only when I sleep And when I wake up from slumber Your shadow's disappeared Your breath is just a sea mist Surrounding my body I'm working through the daytime But when it's time to rest
