Look around your world pretty baby Is it everything you hoped it'd be The wrong guy, the wrong situation The right time to roll to me Roll to me Look into your heart pretty baby Is it aching with some nameless need Is there something wrong and you can't put your finger on it Right then, roll to me And I don't think I have ever seen a soul so in despair So if you want to talk the night through Guess who will be there So don't try to deny it pretty baby You've been down so long you can hardly see When the engine's stalled and it won't stop rainingSo you're in love with someone else Someone who burns within your soul And it looks like I am the last to know I hear you've never felt so alive So much desire beyond control And as usual I am the last to know The last to know how you're feeling The last to know where you are The last to know if you're happy now Or if he's treating you like I treated you Or if he's cruel I'll be the last to know We spent summers up beyond the bay And you said these are such perfect days That if the bomb drops baby I wanna be the last to know But now you're living up behind the hill And though we share the same city and feel the same sun When your winter comes I'll be the last to know Always the last to know how you're feeling The last to know where you are The last to know if you're happy now Or if he's pleaded with you Like I pleaded with you if you go Don't let me be the last to know Don't let me be the last to knowHey, I'm with you, let me just get you a light And if we had thought to listen We might have checked if the weather was right And I don't mind if you want to drive all day Hey, it's raining, I should have brought my coat And sometimes I could sell my soul Just to sit and watch you smoke And I don't mind if you want to break my heart'Cos you can burn paper You can turn a wheel But you can't change later Here and now just how good we can feel Hey, stop talking, think I can hear the sea Did I tell you the sound of the surf Makes strange things happen to me And I don't mind if you want to crash the car'Cos you can turn traitor You can turn on your heels But you can't change later Here and now just how good we can feel And hey, don't worry, so that black cat's some kind of curse'Cos if bad times are coming up ahead Just put us in reversePost office clerks put up signs saying 'position closed'And secretaries turn off typewriters and put on their coats And janitors padlock the gates For security guards to patrol And bachelors phone up their friends for a drink While the married ones turn on a chat show And they'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow Gentlemen time please, you know we can't serve anymore Now the traffic lights change to stop, when there's nothing to go And by five o'clock everything's dead And every third car is a cab And ignorant people sleep in their beds Like the doped white mice in the college lab And nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all The needle returns to the start of the song And we all sing along like before And we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow Telephone exchanges click while there's nobody there The Martians could land in the car park and no one would care Closed-circuit cameras in department stores Shoot the same movie every day And the stars of these films neither die nor get killed Just survive constant action replayTell her not to go I ain't holding on no more Tell her something in my mind freezes up from time to time Tell her not to cry I just got scared, that's all Tell her I'll be by her side, all she has to do is call Tell her the chips are down I drank too much and shouted it aloud Tell her something in my heart Needs her more than even clowns need the laughter of the crowd Tell her what was wrong I sometimes think too much But say nothing at all Tell her from this high terrain, I am ready now to fall Tell her not to go I ain't holding on no more Tell her nothing if not this: all I want to do is kiss her Tell her something in my mind freezes up from time to timeSo long, go on and do your best Let all France have whiskey on its breath The world may not be shaking yet but you might prove them wrong Even long shots make it So go then, out into history And show them how easy it can be And you might not believe it yet but pretty soon you'll see Even long shots make it Just don't come home too soon Just don't come home too soon I don't care what people say We can laugh it all away If I have a dream at all it's that for once you won't be on that stupid plane And the world may not be shaking yet But you might prove them wrong Even long shots make it Just don't come home too soon Just don't come home too soon I don't care what people say We're gonna laugh it all awayYou can't go back Honey that is what they told me And you know what I think of that'Cause I'm back here at your side Were you lonely Were you eaten up inside thinking"If only we'd try"You can't go back A fact that nobody could hold me So I've come back round And I'm holding you to this That thing between us That we knew was something special And it seems it still is They can't destroy us We put the seal on it So be joyous 'cause once the fuse is lit You can't go back You can't go back You can't go back Honey that is what they told us And I know what you think of that You made it pretty clearI shouted at the moon But my love gets hit by a lampoon And I'm just waiting for my mockingbird to copy me now She shoots straight from the throat Under my gate over the moon And I'm just waiting for my mockingbird to copy me now Once I get the pills inside me She'll follow through She'll lie like a fresh kill beside me Swallow what I do I'll drink this phantom at my leisure And she'll mimic me measure for measure But I'm just waiting for my mockingbird to copy me now Mockingbird, copy me now Baby, copy me now Baby, copy me nowDriving through the long night Trying to figure who's right and who's wrong Now the kid has gone I sit belted up tight She sucks on a match light, glowing bronze Steering on And I might be more a man if I stopped this in its tracks And said, come on, let's go home But she's got the wheel And I've got nothing except what I have on When you're driving with the brakes on When you're swimming with your boots on It's hard to say you love someone And it's hard to say you don't Trying to keep the mood right Trying to steer the conversation from The thing we've done She shuts up the ashtray, I say it's a long way back now, hon She just yawns And we might get lost some place So desolate that no one where we're from would ever come But she's got the wheel and I've got to deal from now onI still don't believe it, how much we lied Last night you made it with him now I'm supposed to be dignified Just like a man Well I spend my night-times drinking and you spend your days in bed And I guess it's up to us to choose the methods by which we forget And just like a man he holds you gently And just like a man he strokes your hair And just like a man I still pretend that I'm Immune to the whole affair But I wanna die, I wanna cry, I wanna tell you that I was wrong Yeah I wanna die, I wanna cry but it's too late So I soldier on just like a man I don't believe it, you were easy to leave but now I do my best to relieve it in the only way that I know how Just like a man And I don't wanna possess you, and I don't wanna take his place But I don't wanna see my last few pleasures written all over his face And just like a man he holds you gently And just like a man he strokes your hair And just like a man I still pretend that I'm Immune to the whole affair
