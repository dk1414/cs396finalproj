Smoking weed with you In the leaves, in the fall In the yard with your dog, till the winter came I smoke with you, cuz you’ve taught me to To pass the time, in your living room And I want it with you, so you’ll show me How you do find, me amusing, amusing Before your shift Talking with you, in your bed I saw Your face turn red when I said what I want Getting you to talk, to hear your ideas So shy to my friends, even shy to me And I do believe in what you tell me How you do find me amusing, amusing Before your shift Same thing today, the leaves changed again In your yard, your room No reason to leave here soonIf you forget it all I'll bring it with me If you can't find the sea I'll take you there Even though I'm losing Doesn't make me a loser yet You still know me by name, Green I'll still be Lady Daydream She took it all from me Now I can't find my place Do you remember me Do you know my face It could all be a dreamCould you be near me There's something that I need to say It's kind of a strange thing Just tell me that it's okay Have you ever felt like You would always be alone Like no matter what you do You'd always feel this hole If you could just read me I would make everything right Inside there's a real me Who's been shying away from the light Don't you believe me Are you alright Is there even a real me Or am I just a series of nights Blush BlushI want a house Built of old wood You can paint any color you like Just so long as I can live with you I want a house Built of old wood You can paint any color you like Just so long as I can live with you I want a house Built of old wood You can paint any color you like Just so long as I can live with you I want a house Built of old wood You can paint any color you like Just so long as I can live with youI slipped up, felt the echo of a memory rise up and disappear from me Fill my cup, now that I’ve had two or three, I can get a little free It feels good, to celebrate the loss of my independence I’m in the mood, to let the rhythm push me out of my head I’m lit up, dancing in my room alone I lock my door and turn off my phone Fill my cup, now that I’ve had three or four, I could use a couple more It feels good, to tune out from the wrongs of the world around me I’m in the mood, to let the warm embrace of my cup surround me I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em I’m fucked up, but I think I could have some more if I could get myself off the floor Spilled my cup, the room is tipping to and fro, my mind is moving kinda slow I know I should, break out of these walls I have built around me If only I could, face up to the world let the truth surround meI told you that I like your body Don't question everything The gap you got in your teeth The softness of your smile Don't forget Don't forget who found you Don't forget Forget who found you Don't forget Don't forget who found you Don't forget Forget who found you I told you that I like your body Don't question everything The broken ends of your hair The size of your waist Don't forget Don't forget who found you Don't forget Forget who found you Don't forget Don't forget who found you Don't forget Forget who found youA place that someone knew A little city Red lights Beam up our way, wish upon a star Out of the dark It's someone new A thrill, mesmerized A smile, behind her hands Seeing other girls The lip stick, the tiny skirts Blow them a kiss I am a woman but inside I'm a man And I want to be as gay as I can A thrill, mesmerized A smile, behind her hands Seeing other girls The lip stick, the tiny skirts Blow them a kiss A place that someone knew A little city Street tunnel Beam up our way, wish upon a star Out of the dark It's someone newI don't really want to get to know you I don't really want to catch your first name I've got all the drinks that I can handle Stop telling me so much about yourself What makes you so certain That I want to be forced to notice you You're not even aware of what a bore you are Too vain to even read what I'm thinking Oye rude boy, is that all How'd you get this way All you are is face You need to be everything if you want anything I can’t seem to understand who’d like this I can’t have you hang around much longer You can’t seem to get enough attention You could give someone else your numberAll around and away we go To find it again This is Earth, yours Filling up your heart with hiss You've shown me kindness, and I felt touch Resurrected, sharing white bread Under purple-blue blossoms I'm smiling for two All around and away we go Keep it up and we'll win I'm knowing you And this is love until the end Merry-go-round sends a wave of good humor Feel the power of my many destinies They'll all come trueSaw you making eyes at me Hotels are loneliest In little miss New Jersey Back to work and on your feet And oh, you're so far away And God knows when I'd ever get the chance To touch your hands You know we'll never date Let alone be friends You're so far away It hurts so bad Softly walk away from me Goodbyes are loneliest When you know we'll never meet Face to face or feet to feet And oh, you're so far away And God knows when I'd ever get the chance To touch your hands
