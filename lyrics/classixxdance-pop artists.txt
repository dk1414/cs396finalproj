Hey, come and tell me Do you like bass  Do you, Do you like bass   Do you like bass more, or will you come down  You're holding me up in China Town If you're sure of yourself tonight Grab a coat and a suit and a tie Place the links on the cuffs of your shirt Making sure that your hair is done first In your heart, in your mind Your love, she wakes up paralyzed By your gaze tonight She will fall tonight I fell asleep in your big house dreaming She would wait for me to say goodnight In my heart, in my head she's turning Goodbye, goodbye tonight'Cause it's a stranger love And it's a stranger love tonight Yeah it's a stranger love And if you're sure of yourself tonight Grab a coat and a suit and a tie Place the links on the cuffs of your shirt Making sure that your heart doesn't hurt In your heart, in your mind Your love, she waits in all the lines For all the guys tonight She will fall behindSomewhere in our space and time I get stuck in your arms I get close to you, darling I keep clawing my way inside And sometimes when you run and hide Taxing and breaking and pulling and aching And bursting at the seams Turning your dreams into life, our life Because somebody's always around Watching and listening To all of these things I found All of them safe inside your room You call it ballet Stretching so thin, we're caving in until we bloom What a day Throwing tantrums like parties Or attention like Sunday afternoons Darling, you know I'll come through Because, darling, I know what to do Safe inside your roomSomebody's looking for a situation Somebody's working on the score I wrestle nightly for some instigation Circles running round come back for more Somebody needs a little more everyday Somebody needs a little give I'm gonna line it up, get on the way And take it there again Hey, wait a minute, just a minute, I was ready for the flight Got my bags packed waiting on the driver curve So just a minute, take a minute for the change-up I'm all set to go, set to go And now I'm all you're waiting for I'm all you're waiting for Somebody's looking for a situation Somebody's working on the score If I never got the invitation Would I ever see the exit door We can look for with me All night long We're getting nearer Waiting on borderline If she would talk through the wall Painful night call Just hanging around A real love won't let you down And there's one way up There's one way down And she would love Just to have myself around And there's one way up There's one way down And she would love Just to have myself around Get yourself in love Stand on no one Could link my time Waiting on the borderlinePut your hands up, listen Go do whatever you want Put your hands up Go do, go do whatever you want I can fly, I can scale a tall building in a leap I'm a robot, I don't really need no sleep I can breathe underwater, I can swim for days I do whatever I want and disappear in a haze I'mma let you think 'bout that I'mma let you think 'bout that Ain't nothing you can do about it Ain't nothing you can say to me Oh no, they can't stop me now I'mma do whatever I want I can do anything I want I don't give a damn Cause you just get the consequence And all I get is confidence To do whatever I want I can do anything I want I don't give a damn Cause you just get the consequence And all I get is confidence Do whatever I want Do whatever I wantI've been, I've been I've been holding on and I can't take it I've been holding on and I can't take it anymoreOn the day you awoke, I felt the sunlight go Felt it thawing out the cold Cause every day you've hurt, and every day you've fought It's time to just let go And walk right to the sun, and feel your skin will glow No more wilting your soul Cause every day you've hurt, and every day you've fought It's time to just let go I walk into that sun And see your face shining from the light And I fall into your arms Said enough, your warm heart is gonna take you where the weather You got to just let go, just let go You got to just let go You got to just let go You got to just let go You got to, you got to You got to just You got to just let go You got to, you got to You got to just You got to just let goHey,
