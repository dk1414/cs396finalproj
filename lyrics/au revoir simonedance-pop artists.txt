Oceans shape the sides Touching down in the spaces Soaking from a warm goodbye An early rise offers kindly Tonight I sleep to dream Of a place that's calling me It is always just a dream Still I cannot forget what I have seen The crowd's hard to believe At their faces I'm looking But your feet I'm following In soft steps on a path the way you lead I don't want to lose myself It's a whisper It's a funny thing We fold like icicles on paper shelves It's a pity to appear this way You're flying when your foreign eyes Trace the heights of the city Steaming With rocks and clouds we breathe Violent skies A shock to my own body Speech is wild Alive sacred and sounding Wild From across and beyond, oh far beyondWhen we got to Boston There was a T V in the room You were glowing purple, green, red, black and blue And the light in the night slammed the door And when we went downtown All the babies laughed, clapped at our jokes And when the doctor called it off You ran straight through the snow Shut your eyes to see, but you didn't see me Down in the dark halls We knew that the stark walls said it all And for the first time I found the lines to a childhood memory:"We have the choice to breathe and it's gonna be me"And you may think you lost it Take away, yes you may think you lost it Don't even wonder anymore Erase your mind, turn 'round and slowly walk away Slam the door And you may think you lost it Take away, yes you may think you lost it Don't even wonder anymore Erase your mind, turn 'round and slowly walk away Slam the doorBaby tell me please Is this a dream Spending the night with you Beneath the cherry trees Just make a wish and everything comes true Ooh whoa whoa whoa ooh ohh Ooh whoa whoa whoa ohh ahhahhahh Ooh whoa whoa whoa ooh ohh Ooh whoa whoa whoa ohh ahhahhahh Out the windows of my bedroom Through the backyards of our neighbors But I didn't leave you waiting There was endless concentration Then the moon swept down to greet us It was warm and made of flowers Into vines that barely reached us Climbing higher than forever Ooh whoa whoa whoa ooh ohh Ooh whoa whoa whoa ohh ahhahhahh Ooh whoa whoa whoa ooh ohh Ooh whoa whoa whoa ohh ahhahhahhDo you know when you were already born Do you know this is the way it would be Do you know when you were already born You were already you and I already me So take me as I am Take me as I am I know It's easier said than done But we've talked a million hours To end up just where we begun In this time we're passing With these distractions We could be having fun So take me as I am Take me as I am Forget your plans Do you know when you were already born Do you know this is the way it would be Do you know when you were already born You were already you and I already me So take me as I am Take me as I am Forget your plansSo So long So long ago There wasn't anyone out there I thought I needed to know But no more When I find the day leave my mind in the evening just as the day before I saw the window was open The cool air I don't know what you saw there Don't know what you saw in me Sometimes I want to be enough for you Don't ask Know that it's understood There's not enough of me I saw that something was broken I've crossed the line I'll point you to a better time A safer place to be Sometimes I want to be enough for you Don't ask Know that it's done no good Sometimes I want to be enough for you Don't ask Know that it's done no goodI saw it coming I just thought that you should know I'm feeling better every day I'm only waiting if you stay So don't feel bad Your faith was an illusion And you're as loyal as your faith Will let you be Your expectation It's not hard to live without I'm feeling better every day And emptiness still leaves a space So don't feel bad You lost all your emotion And may you find all your relations Will keep you free A careless bird is complicated An empty nest still leaves a spaceYou can have a night with me Even a day You can have it all wrapped in ribbons If you want it that way I can give you anything you've wanted I just wanna be with you, my darling I just wanna be with you, my darling Anyway Red rabbit Don't run away I will trace you anywhere you go So why don't you stay until the morning'Cause you're gonna lose this fight at morning Anyway A shadow on your windowsill A flash in the night Losing it you're soaking in my doorway in the usual size Catch her up on every single corner To see if I'm still waiting and alone here I'm still waiting and alone here Red rabbit Don't run away I will trace you anywhere you go So why don't you stay until the morning'Cause you're gonna lose this fight at morning AnywayDon't tell me It's another likely story Could've pinned it on you from the start Well I'm new here Doesn't mean I have to answer Silly questions or a shot in the dark You know I'm a child I keep this alive It gets harder I remember to remember Waking up again all over again If there's an echo Repeat days I'd likely let go And be the changes we are noticing When we're running wild We keep this alive Still I wonder Sights around us fade and underneath The ground shakes, things fall apart And no other than the voice of one another Keeps us safely moving on in the darkI don't want to see it through I don't have the heart to fight Lower the flame or try to raise the boiling point Hide away from here Hide away from here Take me to another place Take me to another place So hard to be with you Always the same to strike, or fight, or fire Forever ash to flame No risk before it cools down Hide away from here Hide away from here Take me to another place Take me to another placeOceans shape the sides Touching down in the spaces Soaking from a warm goodbye An early rise offers kindly Tonight I sleep to dream Of a place that's calling me It is always just a dream Still I cannot forget what I have seen The crowd's hard to believe At their faces I'm looking But your feet I'm following In soft steps on a path the
