How can you see into my eyes Like open doors Leading you down into my core Where I've become so numb Without a soul My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold Until you find it there and lead it back home Wake me up inside Wake me up inside Call my name and save me from the dark Bid my blood to run Before I come undone Save me from the nothing I've become Now that I know what I'm without You can't just leave me Breathe into me and make me real Bring me to life  Wake me up inside Wake me up inside Call my name and save me from the dark Bid my blood to run Before I come undone Save me from the nothing I've becomeI'm so tired of being here Suppressed by all my childish fears And if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave'Cause your presence still lingers here And it won't leave me alone These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time cannot erase When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears And I held your hand through all of these years But you still have all of me You used to captivate me by your resonating light Now I'm bound by the life you left behind Your face, it haunts my once pleasant dreams Your voice, it chased away all the sanity in me These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time cannot eraseLithium Don't wanna lock me up inside Lithium Don't wanna forget how it feels without Lithium I wanna stay in love with my sorrow, oh But God, I wanna let it go Come to bed, don't make me sleep alone Couldn't hide the emptiness, you let it show Never wanted it to be so cold Just didn't drink enough to say you love me I can't hold on to me Wonder what's wrong with me Lithium Don't wanna lock me up inside Lithium Don't wanna forget how it feels without Lithium I wanna stay in love with my sorrow, ahPlayground school bell rings again Rain clouds come to play again Has no one told you she's not breathing Hello, I'm your mind giving you someone to talk to Hello If I smile and don't believe Soon I know I'll wake from this dream Don't try to fix me, I'm not broken Hello, I'm the lie living for you so you can hide Don't cry Suddenly I know I'm not sleeping Hello, I'm still here All that's left of yesterdayNow I will tell you what I've done for you Fifty thousand tears I've cried Screaming, deceiving and bleeding for you And you still won't hear me Don't want your hand this time, I'll save myself Maybe I'll wake up for once Not tormented, daily defeated by you Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom I'm dying again I'm going under Drowning in you I'm falling forever I've got to break through I'm going under Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies So I don't know what's real and what's not Always confusing the thoughts in my head So I can't trust myself anymorePerfect by nature Icons of self-indulgence Just what we all need More lies about a world That never was and never will be Have you no shame, don't you see me You know you've got everybody fooled Look here she comes now Bow down and stare in wonder Oh, how we love you No flaws when you're pretending But now I know She never was and never will be You don't know how you betrayed me And somehow you've got everybody fooled Without the mask, where will you hide Can't find yourself lost in your lie I know the truth now I know who you are And I don't love you anymoreI don't know your heart I don't know where to begin But I could feel you erasing the rivers I'd drawn in The more I stood still The faster you were running You don't know how it feels crawling under your skin So far, so far away Don't you know we could be High or Low You never fell beneath me And I gave up on you But I never forgot you I can't be your friend Hold your hand while you bleed There's nothing left to give you Nothing more I need Time to let it sleep Oh, the damage was real But nothing cut me so deep I could not heal Don't you know we could beDon't cry to me If you loved me You would be here with me You want me Come find me Make up your mind Should I let you fall, lose it all So maybe you can remember yourself Can't keep believing, we're only deceiving ourselves And I'm sick of the lie And you're too late Don't cry to me If you loved me You would be here with me You want me Come find me Make up your mind Couldn't take the blame, sick with shame Must be exhausting to lose your own game Selfishly hated, no wonder you're jaded You can't play the victim this timeI tried to kill my pain But only brought more I lay dying and I'm pouring Crimson regret and betrayal I'm dying, praying Bleeding and screaming Am I too lost to be saved Am I too lost My God, my tourniquet Return to me salvation My God, my tourniquet Return to me salvation Do you remember me Lost for so long Will you be on the other side Or will you forget me I'm dying, praying Bleeding and screaming Am I too lost to be saved Am I too lost I don't need drugs I'm already six feet low Wasted on you Waitin' for a miracle I can't move on Feels like we're frozen in time I'm wasted on you Just pass me the bitter truth Love, don't you remember We were the ones Nothing could ever change and Love, it's easier not to believe We have broken everything But here we are Numb my head'Til I can't think anymore But I still feel the pain I don't need drugs I'm already six feet low Wasted on you Waitin' for a miracle I can't move on Feels like we're frozen in time I'm wasted on you Just pass me the bitter truth
