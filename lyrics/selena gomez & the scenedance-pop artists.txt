feel me when I think about you With every breath I take Every minute, no matter what I do My world is an empty place Like I've been wanderin' the desert for a thousand days Don't know if it's a mirage, but I always see your face, baby I'm missin' you so much Can't help it, I'm in love A day without you is like a year without rain I need you by my side Don't know how I'll survive A day without you is like a year without rain Oh-oh Whoa, whoa The stars are burnin'I hear your voice in my mind Can't you hear me callin'?My heart is yearning like the ocean that's runnin' dry Catch me, I'm fallin'It's like the ground is crumblin' underneath my feet Won't you save me There's gonna be a monsoon when you get back to me Oh, babyEverybody tells me that it's so hard to make it It's so hard to break in, there's no way to fake it Everybody tells me that it's wrong what I'm feelin'I shouldn't believe in the dreams that I'm dreamin'I hear it every day I hear it all the time"I'm never gonna amount to much"But they're never gonna change my mind, no Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know Somethin' I don't know Somethin' I don't know Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know Somethin' I don't know Somethin' I don't know Like how many inches in a mile What it takes to make you smile Get you not to treat me like a child, baby Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know Somethin' I don't know Somethin' I don't knowHow you choose to express yourself It’s all your own and I can tell it comes naturally It comes naturally You follow what you feel inside It’s intuitive, you don’t have to try, it comes naturally Mmm, it comes naturally And it takes my breath away What you do so naturally You are the thunder and I am the lightning And I love the way you know who you are And to me, it's exciting When you know it's meant to be Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally When you're with me, baby Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally Ba-ba-baby You have a way of moving me A force of nature, your energy It comes naturally It comes naturally  It's the boy you never told "I like you"It's the girl you let get away It's the one you saw that day on the train But you freaked out and walked away It's the plane you wanna catch to Vegas Things you swear you'll do before you die It's the city of love that waits for you But you're too damn scared to fly Hit the lights Let the music move you Lose yourself tonight Come alive Let the moment take you Lose control tonight Hit the lights Let the music move you Lose yourself tonight Come alive Let the moment take you Lose control tonight It's the time that you totally screwed up Still, you're tryna get it out your brain It's the fight you had when you didn't make up It's the past that you're dying to change It's all the money that you're savin'While the good life passes by It's all the dreams that never came true'Cause you're too damn scared to tryRound and round Round and round Round and round You see me standing there and act like you don't know me But last night, you were callin' me, sayin' you want me Oh, why you always make me feel like I'm the one that's crazy You got my heart racin'My, my heart racin'Boy, I need you here with me We can't go on this way I'm falling hard for you All I can say We're going 'round and 'round We're never gonna stop goin''Round and 'round We'll never get where we're goin''Round and 'round Well, you're gonna miss me, 'cause I'm gettin' dizzy Going 'round and 'round and 'roundTurned my back to the door Feel so much better now Don't even try anymore Nothing left to lose There's a voice that's in the air Saying don't look back nowhere There's a voice that's always there And I'll never be quite the same as I was before This part of you still remains Though it's out of focus You're just somewhere that I've been And I won't go back again You're just somewhere that I've been I'm breathing in, breathing out Ain't that what it's all about Living life, crazy loud, like I have the right to No more words in my mouth, nothing left to figure out But I don't think I'll ever break through The ghost of you And I'll never be like I was the day I met you Too naive, yes, I was Boy, that's why I let you in Wear your memory like a stain Can't erase or numb the pain Here to stay with me foreverYeah, yeah Woah, woah, oh My new boy used to be a model He looks way better than you, he looks way better than you My new boy gets it, how to get me His love is deeper, you know, he's a real keeper, you know, oh Bang, bang, bang, I'm breaking in Stealing all my love back, giving it to him Bang, bang, bang, this time I win I thought your love was all that 'til I let him in You're gonna be the one, you're gonna be the one You're gonna be the one, you're gonna be the one that's moping You're gonna be the one, you're gonna be the one When I'm out having fun, you’re gonna be the one that's broken My new boy knows the way I want it He's got more swagger than you, he's got more swagger than you do My new boy really likes to flaunt this He's not hiding me, you know, he's showing me off, you know, ohYou make me so upset sometimes I feel like I could lose my mind The conversation goes nowhere'Cause you're never gonna take me there And I know what I know And I know you're no good for me Yeah, I know what I know And I know it's not meant to be Here's my dilemma:One half of me wants ya And the other half wants to forget My-my-my dilemma from the moment I met ya I just can't get you outta my head And I tell myself to run from you But I find myself attracted to my dilemma My dilemma, it's you, it's you Your eyes have told a thousand lies But I believe them when they look in mine I heard the rumors, but you won't come clean I guess I'm hoping it's because of me
