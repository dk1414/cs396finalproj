In the cool of the evening When everything is getting kinda groovy I call you up and ask you If you'd like to go with me and see a movie First you say no, you've got some plans for the night Then you stop and say "alright"Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you You always keep me guessing I never seem to know what you are thinking And if a girl looks at you It's for sure your little eye will be a-winking I get confused 'cause I don't know where I stand And then you smile and hold my hand Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you Spooky Maybe someday you'll decide to stop these games That you've been playing I'm gonna tell you all the things my heart's Been dying to be saying Just like a ghost you've been haunting my dreams So I proposed on Halloween Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you SpookyWe had a date12th street at eight If you're gonna be there, don't be late Instructed as such Without a soft touch If it would've mattered, it didn't too much I waited for you a minute or two Well, just what kind of a girl do you think I am Fumbing around a cigarette Smoked it to the ash and then lit up again Blowing smoke rings Blind the air If you're comin', baby, you're just two in a rears I'm too impatient, and you're just too late My attention span is just not that great Then this young kinda guy walked right on by me He couldn't have been more than sixteen There's just nothing I can do you gotta understand You see, he had this walk I mean, down pat and No he wasn't going my direction so I just kinda turned and I I had to, I was a woman possessed I mean, I wasn't myselfI am bongo crazed with the crazy beat Makes me stamp and shout Get up on my feet All the boys go wild with the bongo chill Chase the girls around for a bongo thrill Forget the beach Party with no stuff'Cause it's kind of fun But it's not enough Let the boys go wild and the boys don't miss When they grab the girls for a bongo kiss Surfing's not too cool Just what can you do Standing on a board and the water's smooth All the girls go wild, start to shake their seeds When the boys start to play their bongo beat I am bongo crazed with the crazy beat Makes me stamp and shout Get up on my feet All the boys go wild with the bongo chill Chase the girls around for a bongo thrill Forget the beach Party with no stuff'Cause it's kind of fun But it's not enough But the boys go wild and the boys don't miss When they chase the girls for a bongo kissFingers move fingers My wrists made of satin Don't be afraid of what's gonna happen Elbows to ankles my fists out of place I turn around backwards and off slides my face Bones plattered shattered Dissolving my skin My torso melts it flows out my shins Open so open a circular mark The cut on my forehead it glows in the dark Ran away dark dank stank moss creeps Cross the river I run from the dark stark fear For I'd run, I run from the night I say so sad, so dead and mad An angry diehard tears from mad My veins in pain They torch my mouth the saint Ran away dark dank stank moss it creeps Cross the river I run from the dark stark fear I run from the nightSunday is gloomy My hours are slumberless Dearest the shadows I live with are numberless Little white flowers Will never awaken you Not where the black coach Of sorrow has taken you Angels have no thoughts Of ever returning you Would they be angry If I thought of joining you Gloomy Sunday Gloomy is Sunday With shadows, I spend it all My heart and I Have decided to end it all Soon there'll be candles And prayers that are said I know But let them not weep Let them know that I'm glad to goBodies Bodies Touched by the toil and plunged into his arms Cursed through the night with eyes of alarm A melody black flowed out of my breath Searching for death, but bodies need rest Bodies Under the soil now waiting for worms All that I feared is all that I've learned All that I know is all that I think Dead feelings are cool, down lower I sink Bodies need rest, we all need our rest Sleep an easy sleep, rest, rest Bodies need their rest We all need our rest Sleep an easy sleep, rest, rest, rest, rest But come back in the morning Come back hard Wake up Wake up Wake up Wake upThey're coming for me now Nothing scares me anyhow I can't feel the heat Some kind of crazy scene I'm gonna let this one rip It's just another fucked up trip I'm gonna let this one rip It's just another fucked up trip Oh God how it bores me To see myself ?But I give   once again I'm gonna let this one rip You're on another fucked up trip I'm gonna let this one rip It's just another fucked up trip They're coming for me now Nothing scares me anyhow Nothing scares me anymore Just another manic whoreTake the wheel, of the world And drive, drive, drive, drive, drive Quick as a gun Blind like a ghost I catch most things in my blood You all lose between rooms One last gasp before I go Your crystal skin laced with rust Laced with rust, laced with rust Take the wheel of the world and drive One blood lust glance of the milky way Two shots, one in a million Short-circuits a billion light years away Down here it rains blood and milk for months The Zulus are getting too strong to play with no more No more, no more Take the wheel of the world and drive A pocket too full of the stars Too hot to handle alone Burning a hole, smoldering footsteps that lead to a heart Mine, yours, who cares, it still burns Still borne I'm still burning Burning down Take the wheel of the world and driveWe'll go for a walk and you'll get nowhere This road leads to every disaster Riding shotgun thru this silence Spitting out these vicious secrets There's a kill in a car and he's parking it right outside my face Get it done with, get it done with Is that a coffin fulluva cupids you keep pushing through my gate There's a lot of fallen angels getting crushed beneath his feet Now the killer gets the car and just drives it right into my guts Get it done with, get it done with Now the tears start flowing the fun really starts Goodbye heaven, here comes heartache Now the tears start flowing the fun really starts Goodbye heaven, here comes heartbreak Well the blood is really flowing and the fun it really starts I don't need no derelict bloodshed To lay these stains upon your altar Saying prayers for passion killers Who like saints commit these murdersBlood and guts in the movie house, slaughterhouse, slaughterhouse He rips through all the movie buffs, he rips them up, he rips them up He goes where don't wanna go and what he does, he doesn't know He's the saddest creature known to man An unknown Sam in an unkind land He's out of his head and it's out of his hands He's out of his head and it's out of his hands He's out of his head and it's out of his hands He's out of his head and it's out of his hands He's dead in the head He's dead in the head He's dead in the head He's dead in the head He does it up because he's come undone, he does the blood walk and he does the blood run Everything is going black, he's feeling weak with a mean streak Come to me, my little one, my heart is stone, my heart is cold He's out of his head and it's out of his hands He's out of his head and it's out of his hands He's out of his head and it's out of his hands He's out of his head and it's out of his hands
