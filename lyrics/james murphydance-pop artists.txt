This life, and all the things I'd known Turned away, and left behind The truth was buried long ago Memories fade in passing time For years, I felt my solitude Never seemed to leave my side My way was lost forever then All my dreams were cast aside I turn away but the vision of truth stains my eyes I try to run but the image cuts through my disguise Beneath the emptiness, reveals my bitterness I cannot soon forget, this dream's not over yet In the land of my birth, I am still touching the earth The fears that kept me far away Slowly die and draw me near The past I sought to bury deep Comes again to fill my need I cast away all the stones that carried me down I will return to the life that my past tried to drown Beneath the emptiness, reveals my bitterness I cannot soon forget, this dream's not over yet In the land of my birth, I am still touching the earthIt's not an ego I'm not trying to mess you up I just want to be where Soon is never quick enough So I'm feeling what I feel Just a little tired of being used Hey now you losers What's in this for me I'm only after what I feel should be mine anyway So cut it, cut it...Cutting, cutting...Coming, coming...Running, running...Cut it, cut it...Cutting, cutting...Coming, coming...Running, running...Because every time I open myself to a friend I always leave my trust to take But now I swear to you that this will never happen again And to myself..  I'm sorry for it allBreak out the trumpets and start to applaud Let the floods lift up their waves unto God Come join with the mountains and skip like the rams Worship the Father of Abraham Enter the temple and open the gates Come into His presence, bring Him your praise Lift up His glory and pull back the veil Enter the temple of Emmanuel, singing...Holy, holy, holy Holy is our God Holy, holy, holy Holy is our God Holy is our God See the hills tremble, let the sea roar Come join the children's song on the shore Shout out the ways of the Lord in the land We come as the sheep of His hands Assemble together, see the Father in joy His children carry their banner of joy Come all ye people whom God has restored Let's praise the Name of the Lord, singing... Feels like Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde Are fighting each other deep inside To see who'll be the one to abide And take me as their own Which one wins is up to me I must choose which one’s to be The Lord that lives inside of me The choice is mine alone It's black or white Nothing in the middle It's dark or light No shades of grey Well, it’s wrong or right Can't stand in the middle It's a black or white decision today Here I stand between wrong and right A decision must be made tonight Two roads diverge, one dark, one light Both beckon with their call All the cars are their in view I'm aware of what I must do It's one or the other, it can't be two I must give one my allCandles burning from both edges, babe I was never one to misbehave Don't wanna be a golden boy Don't wanna be a crook Write my name in blood on the history books If you start to look from the outside in Then you start to see what's been happening May your lungs be strong May your feet be swift May your help arrive For the graveyard shift Sweet angels in the sky above We were never born out of a labour of love You know I'm drowning in My restlessness, that's when the angels come to manifest And if you start to look from thе outside in Then you start to see what's been happening May your lungs bе strong May your feet be swift May your help arrive For the graveyard shiftWell, it's Friday night again And you've got the same decision Seems a little harder this time Friends are pulling one way And Jesus the other Temptation's working overtime People call asking you to come over The party's gonna be a blast Can't put off what's got to be done Your ballot must be cast And don't let your heart Follow after your eyes'Cause sometimes eyes Seem to lose their sight Don't let your heart Follow after your eyes Hearts see more clearly About what's wrong or right Don't let your heart Follow after your eyes Popular opinion has a strong, strong pull Especially when you want to fit in Say you'd do just about whatever it took To get yourself a friendThis life, and all the things I'd known Turned away, and left behind The truth was buried long ago Memories fade in passing time For years, I felt my solitude Never seemed to leave my side My way was lost forever then All my dreams were cast aside I turn away but the vision of truth stains my eyes I try to run but the image cuts through my disguise Beneath the emptiness, reveals my bitterness I cannot soon forget, this dream's not over yet In the land of my birth, I am still touching the earth The fears that kept me far away Slowly die and draw me near The past I sought to bury deep Comes again to fill my need I cast away all the stones that carried me down I will return to the life that my past tried to drown Beneath the emptiness, reveals my bitterness I cannot soon forget, this dream's not over yet In the land of my birth, I am still touching the earthIt's not an ego I'm not trying to mess you up I just want to be where Soon is never quick enough So I'm feeling what I feel Just a little tired of being used Hey now you losers What's in this for me I'm only after what I feel should be mine anyway So cut it, cut it...Cutting, cutting...Coming, coming...Running, running...Cut it, cut it...Cutting, cutting...Coming, coming...Running, running...Because every time I open myself to a friend I always leave my trust to take But now I swear to you that this will never happen again And to myself..
