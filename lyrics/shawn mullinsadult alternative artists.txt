She grew up With the children of the stars In the Hollywood Hills and the boulevard Her parents threw big parties Everyone was there They hung out with folks Like Dennis Hopper and Bob Seger And Sonny and Cher She feels safe now in this bar on Fairfax And from the stage I can tell that She can`t let go and she can`t relax And just before She hangs her head to cry I sing to her a lullaby Everything is gonna be all right Rockabye Rockabye Everything is gonna be all right Rockabye Rockabye RockabyeSharing with us what he knows His shining eyes are big and blue And all around him water flows This world to him is new This world to him is new To touch a face To kiss a smile And new eyes see no race The essence of a child The essence..He's born to shimmer He's born to shine He's born to radiate He's born to live He's born to love Teach him how to hate And true love it is a rock Smoothed over by a stream And no ticking of a clock Truly measures what that means Truly measures what that means And this thing we call our time I heard a brilliant woman say She said you know it's crazy How I want to try and capture mine I think I love this woman's way I think I love this woman's..Way she shimmers The way she shines The way she radiates The way she lives The way she loves The way she never hatesI met him on the cliffs Of twin rocks oregon He was sittin on his bedroll Lookin just like richard brautigan I thought he was an old man He wasn't but 37 He said he'd been ridin trains For 15 years Drawin portraits To keep his belly full of beer And it looked to me like he'd died And missed the plane to heaven But he was a nice ol' guy For a younger man He had a bottle of mad dog He held in his hand That he waved around a lot To make his point And I listened as he told his tales Of wine and women and county jails And we finished off that bottle And smoked a half a joint He said "I came here to watch the sun Disappear into the ocean It's been years Since I smelled this salty sea"He turned his bottle up and down And I saw him lost And I saw him found He said "I don't know What I've been lookin for, maybe me..  "Well, I told him I too had been Travelin around livin out of my van From town to town playin for tips And whatever records I could move I said "I don't reckon i'll be Makin it big You know it's hard to get rich Off a tout of coffee house gigs"And he said "yeah, but ain't it a blessin To do what you wanna do..  "And I told him "yeah, I pulled off here To watch the sun disappear into the ocean'cause it's been years Since I smelled this salty sea"And he turned his bottle up and down He saw me lost and he saw me found And I said"I don't know what I've been looking for, maybe me"I said "it's getting kind of late Better be heading down the interstate Can I give you a lift To san francisco bay  "He said "nope, I think I'm just Going to sit here and rest And maybe wait on the Tokyo-montana express I might just lay here And dream my life away I'm going to sit right here I'm going to watch the sun Disappear into the ocean'cause it's been years, it's been years I'm gonna turn my bottle up and down You can see my lost And you can see my found"I met him on the cliffs Of twin rocks, oregon He was sitting on his bedroll Looking just like richard brautigan Just like himI've been on the road too long And i've been stuck inside a song And you know our love has been Through rougher weather But our passion's like a rose The seasons tell it how it grows And not much compares To the times we've shared together'cause love heals everything We're no exception to the rule You mean everything to me So if there is anything at all All you've got to do is call And you know that I would Drive 10,000 miles Just to show you that I care Just to kiss your honey hair And pull you close And hold you like a child Love heals everything We're no exception to that rule You mean everything You mean everything You mean everything to meI am in motion I am blue Love is an ocean I'm anchored in you But I am a dreamer So you sent me away Sometimes we dreamers Just get in the way But I've always known Since I was a child That the road is my home And my spirit is wild And I have my memories And I've got lots of time And I'm stoned in san francisco With you on my mind I am in motion I am blue Love is an ocean I'm anchored in you, love is an oceanWhat I feel, I can't saybut my love is there for you anytime of day But if it's not love that you need Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed Tell me, what is my life without your love Tell me, who am I without you, by my sidewhat I know, I can do If

she might have loved Him once but that was long ago And the rain pours down Like a holy waterfall Over the gulf of mexico The boardwalk's deserted And the beach is all closed down And the middle school punkrockers Ride their skateboards Through the town And she looks back and she daydreams About things and people she's never Seen just to keep from being blue and She gets home about a quarter to four And drives her brother To the liquor store on ocean avenue And I'm parked on the state line on this Cold november day and pretty soon i'll Be a drivin fool somewhere down this Lost highway Then I hear a voice from My soul's core sayin "freedom's just a Metaphor, you got nowhere to go"And the rain pours down like a Holy waterfall over the gulf of mexico Over the gulf of mexicoMy name's
