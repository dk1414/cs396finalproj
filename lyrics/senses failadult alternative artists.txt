"Follow your bliss," it reads on my chest I know I got it tattooed for a reason, why can't I just hold it true 'Cause I'm still crashing all the funerals Of these people that I never knew, yeah!I'm stuck in a coma, stuck in a never-ending sleep And someday I will wake up and realize I made up everything I shut the door and turn all the lights out And listen to all the songs that the night shouts They go something just like this So, go fill up a glass with tonic, rocks, and gin And drink yourself to happiness I'm stuck in a coma, stuck in a never-ending sleep And someday I will wake up and realize I made up everything We cannot hang ourselves from gold chandeliers And drink goodbye to all, all the pain and fears Loose lips have sunk this ship to a shallow grave Washed up upon the rocks, I won't be saved, I won't be saved Calling all cars, we've got another victim'Cause my love has become an affliction What did you expect from me What did you expect from me I'm sorry, but I think I failed to mention That I lied at my very first confession What did you expect from me What did you expect from me 'Cause this has been building since I have been breathing And I know how it's going to end So will you scatter my ashes where they won't be found I kept my word when I swore that I would let you down And now that I'm gone Try to forget me, and just move on So will you scatter my ashes where they won't be found I kept my word, and you hate me for it now But you knew all along Try to forget me, and just move onEach day it gets a little worse Trying so hard to follow my dreams You know I need life insurance but I can barely pay my rent I’m a millennial son of a bitch I’d rather die poor than give in I’m not lazy, I just don’t give a shit about material things So take a pill to make you smile And go buy shit you don’t need'Cause don’t you know that Jesus Christ loves America That’s why we’re always winning And don’t forget to lock your door And board up the window panes'Cause you got to defend yourself From anyone who doesn’t think the same Fuck yeah, I’ve always been anxious'Cause I’ve always been in debt And when I was eighteen two planes flew into a fucking building And we’ve been at war ever since We destroyed the environment Fuck the government, it’s an embarrassment We’re all going die in debtHow am I supposed to raise you when I'm so afraid Of all that I can pass down, it won't be just my name I've tried so hard to imagine our place The tears streaming down from my face My father meant nothing to me But I hope I mean something to you Grab my hand, hold it tight, let the water take us tonight Grab my hand, hold it tight, let the water take us tonight How am I supposed to move on when I'm so afraid Of the loneliness that I feel when the sun sets on your grave I guess the best thing I can do with my time is love every minute of life When the fact is I would rather curl up and die I can't breathe if you're not alive Grab my hand, hold it tight, let the water take us tonight Grab my hand, hold it tight, let the water take us tonight Grab my hand, hold it tight, let the water take us tonight Grab my hand, hold it tight, let the water take us tonight How do I forget you If there is light, I hope it finds you How can I forget you How can I forget you If there is light, I hope it finds you If there is light, I hope it finds youRest in peace, girl, your death is such a shame The paper said a bullet got in your way But I smell foul play, possible poisoning I had to bring you in for questioning I went to your grave Dug up your body Brought it to my house Where you lay So let's play doctor, babe We'll operate today Incisions must be made You could help solve this case For me I headed downtown to share what I had found It's not a suicide, it's a crime I have a witness, it's clearly evident There had to be someone else present At the time of death Poison's in stomach How could she pull it If she's dead So the lie now is my weapon Like a bush dried and withered in the sun With this spark I'll go up in flames I'd lay my guts out but they're too small to see It's kinda cute how I pretend to be Everything but the instrument I am Peace or happiness So let it enfold you A birth to life is what I'm after My first name won't be my last one Let the light just drip into your eyes So it's true my words are contrived I tell lies just to get into your mind I'm as fake as a widow's smile This mask of glass is what I choose to wear So I won't ever have the need to bare The total truth to anyone but me Peace or happiness So let it enfold you A birth to life is what I'm after My first name won't be my last one Let the light just drip into your eyesWhile you’re watching from the window waiting I’ve been spilling my guts out on the stage I spent the best years of my life Drinking myself to sleep at night And now the glory days have all but faded Everyone I used to know is jaded Where is the passion that you used to have When music was the only thing that you had All my pictures have faded over time I burnt the negatives of you What have I got here left to prove 'Cause all I got, all I really got is this music that’s left of me And all I want, all I really want is a reason to believe Some day I know that I’ll be fading Everyone I used to know is getting afraid, afraid, afraid of getting older And every heart I love grows colder I love when time slips by I’m not afraid to die Remember the passion that you used to have When music was the only thing that you had This still is the only thing that, that is worth my breath This still is the only thing that, that is worth my breathSo let me take this medicine To quench my love for violent things My swan song will Be like a bullet laced in anger As the razor cuts the soft spot on your heel Each breath is getting slower This war is getting harder to fight by myself Sick waves of bitter fashion Ripped down the shield that I have Tears rain from above Do you see the life I lead So follow me into the sun And I will bleed the poisons dry These bayonet scars never cease To blind the light shed from the beast And all we do is hate Eyes shot from constant visions Angels are rendered useless Good has lost it's heart Do you see the life I lead So follow me into the sun And I will bleed the poisons dryI watched you bleed out I watched your lungs cave I saw that worst thing that I've ever seen As I watched you slip away from me And our daughter's first breath is the last one you will ever take And I don't think I can make it on my own Remember they said you'd have to sacrifice I know But I was not prepared to watch the life drain from your soul I have never felt so crushed, the sadness buried in my bones How the hell am I supposed to raise a daughter on my own I turn to stone when I look in your eyes I lost the only reason that I'm alive I don't know if any words will do All that I know is I'm so in love with you There was nothing that they could do After three days of labor it's a miracle that anyone survived I'm alive, but I'm dead inside And I'm supposed to raise a child with a smile now I used to wonder why people put bullets in their brains Now it seems like the only way to stop this pain How the fuck am I supposed to wake up every day And pretend that I love her as much as I miss your faceJust know we are a speck in time So follow your bliss and destroy the beauty I'll lock myself alone in a room Drink until the clock strikes noon With just a pen, a pill, and some paper And maybe I will write a sad song Or another cliché poem Of the person that I long to be I wanna die like Jim Morrison A fucking rock star I wanna die like God on the cover of Time Just a blink and it's gone So baby, pour some fame in my glass So kill the forest and destroy the beauty I'll lock myself alone in a room Drink until the clock strikes noon With just a pen, a pill, and some paper And maybe I will write a sad song Or another cliché poem Of the person that I long to be
