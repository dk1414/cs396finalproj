Tell them motherfuckers to shut the fuck up in the background!There's a new song and dance going on!Up in the M GM Grand with ten G's in his hand Coked out, drinking, thinking of the reasons he’s planned For shit to get hot as the summer till it’s freezing again Bullets pop off, hit you like it’s grease from the pan Man, he don’t he believe in the law Is it all regards  Demons and lords Stacking up paper, scheming the broads What's his name, is it Steven or George Half of the time, that’s where the crime is Kids, he’s been involved Scare bids, even it off Divas got his evening revolving Not even the problem, the meanest of all But the semen's evolved to get his penis and balls in Lisa and all, who’s a piece of shit whore With some creaks in her jaw that squeaks like a dolphin He don’t even do drugs, he’s getting off em He crashes into a wall, crawls in the coffin ×2 Bobby be real They told him "Bobby be real" They said life isn't easy Keep holding on to that wobbly wheel{*belches*} Get your booze Light your blunts up Get your hard drugs And we doin it I'll serve your ass like John Mc Enroe Put a .45 Colt to the back of your skull Cut my finger on a razorblade baggin up blow Hit the back do' with a little strag and a ho Ho, oh, yeah you heard the news But I'm back from the grave just to murder youse And I've been up in the streets kickin curbs in shoes Number one draft pick with the vertical Bleep  Bleep  White men can't jump, nah But I can dump slugs from a shotgun pump I come from a hood you do not come from If you think I'm no good take a shot dumb dumb Dummy - come and try to take shit from me Little rookie, looky how the cookie's so crumby I ain't owe the dealer or the bookie no money I just owe it to the world cause I'm lookin' so funny99 bottles of beer on the wall99 problems and you're hearin' them all99 ways, 99 lines99 rhymes fit 99 times Drink that, sip that Smoke that, sniff that Break that, take that99 bottles of beer on the wallI've been caught up in the darkness of my anger and my hatred I close my eyes and see myself hanging in the basement Dangling my legs, veins straining in my head Blood draining in the tub, drowning in it {*glub glub*}I been down in it: the mud - I mean down in it: the dirt I mean really down in it, lost and found in it bezerk I've been burned by the fire, scorched by the flames Of my own sins and desires so I call them by their names When they come~  Greed, Gluttony, Sloth, Envy and Lust They're all enemies, but they act so friendly with us They roll with, two other guys we call Wrath and Pride Now I'm half as high as I am low..I can laugh and cry at the same time but I can't slow Down, feeling manicky, panicky, full of anarchy Can it be so simple to get rid of them with Ritalin I'm trying to get into Heaven cutting out the middle man Every time I drift away I see myself dead and buried in the cemetery Accidentally staring at the sun Shining through the filthy glass windows Broken bottles in the bed-sheets tangled, bloody naked with a gun I'm livin in this tiny-ass room with the mattress on the floor And an ashtray, look what I've become Light up a half-sniped cigarette and take my last swig of liquor Smoke the filter down down till it's done - but I ain't doneI'm starting to see clearer then I ever have Bipolar, tell me which one is my better half Eyes colder 'cause I slipped up on my better path My shoulders is so chipped I almost never laugh You can hear my revving raps Sounding like the engine of a 747 crash Back out the trash, I was never more but shredding ash Now I'm feeling sharper than a heavy ass machete slash Give me lip, cut your head in half, you won't get it back Had some dead weight on my back, I got rid of that Got my head straight and left the flask in my livid past And I ain't bitter of a quitter but consider that I lost a few wings I'm trying to do things to get it back'Cause life isn't all roses and daffodils Especially when you rose from The bullet holes and smashed up pills Made it out alive but pissed away a half a mil Trying to keep a smile, I'm having a hard time laughing still Rite Hook I seem to keep this smile While they keep looking down on me Knocked down, I get up, this is how to be Knocked down, I get up, this is how to be Knocked down, I get up, this is how to beI been watchin' you all as you ride with dishonesty Y'all been claimin' king, but you die with no dynasty Little look how cats tryin' to hide for a finder's fee Demon on my side, that's my guy, he's remindin' me Every rapper mine, back in time, they're rewindin' me Every backwards mind that I turned is in line with me My mystique is real, I'm the legend in the urban myth Drug addiction all around my corner and I'm servin'You should know this and notice to put it on a notice They'll stab you in the back when the hood is on your shoulders Speakin' to the people so what good is y'all promoters I analyzed the game and understood it all was bogus So I been watchin' you watchin' me and I'm lookin' back Seen you pushin' smack, countin' dirty money, cookin' crack I used to have cigarette burns in my sofa You listen to my world as it turns in my culture Ridin' by myself got me feelin' lonely Cruisin' through the city with my tank on me Lookin' for my friends, where the fuck's my homies The only thing I ask for is loyalty There's way too many snakes in this game for me And murdered is the only thing you get for free I ain't even worried 'bout my lawyer's fees My gun "bang, bang" for that loyaltyIf this the last song I ever wrote If it were to be the night that these motherfuckers murdered me If it were to be a car crash, swerving into a Mercury Burgundy splashed through the glass when sirens circle me I will be viewed as violent certainly Drug-addled so maybe I've only written the worst of me Maybe by me even writing these words, I'm tempting the fates They come from the heart, sent from a place I couldn't find in my mind, I was blind, I was lost In a time warp with a mind warped from a sick scene On a sidewalk, full of suicide thoughts Full of false dreams and hopes that you and I bought Like dope, so we had to find things to cope Ended up covered in dirt, not washed with soap We ended up learning all about the cost of coke by the rope And seen some good folks lost from dope I can't begin to begin, I'm just horrified You hear me penning this thing, you think it's glorified I just hear the pendulum swing again and again The same song, broken dreams and dead friends I been where I been now I stand where I am As a man with a mic in his hand and goddamn Back holding the crack, planet that's covered with monkeys As I walk through the halls of recovering junkiesTermanology Bun B Motherfuckin’ Slaine Everlast Duffle bag Uh, All I need is a hundred thousand of my dollars And to launder that shit through somebody wit a white collar Nightcrawler, ice robber, mic sparker Steal money from my hoes, give it to my baby mama You be on the ground, no lights, switch the pick up I be thinkin’ let’s go to war and hit the pigs up I still hustle, build muscle, Bill Russell Rap hero, stack zeros, mad euros What if we opened business instead of provokin’ witnesses And realize the positive future for us was limitless Instead we in the club with a devilish smirk And we talk about God but we never in church Motherfuckers is ready to go to Hell for a purse That put a shell in ya earth, the way it’s gettin’ is worse And these streets squeeze you, enemies dyin’ to seize you It seem like everybody I know is livin’ illegal Like Jamal and Malik did But we ain’t fallin’ for fuckery or the weak shit I keep the heat wit, me, myself, and I Go ahead and pump your pussy-self up to die That’s when doves will cry Cause you’ll do the gangster lean, I’ll do the gangster boogie You could never be a gangster to me You a wangster truly, plus you dealin’ in a fool trade If I cut you, I bet your ass will bleed Kool-Aid What flavor  Tap water, 'cause you got none Sit on this Winchester, now you ridin’ shotgun And I’mma wipe you off the scene right now I’m with Term with S C, we in The Bean right now Motherfuckers askin’ how the Hell we keep coppin’ and choppin’ up that powder Whiter than clam chowder Preem got the beat on fire like Niki Lauda For-real emcee and Hip-Hop couldn’t be prouderI chewed a hole in my soul and I was still starving This fucking demon in my head is like a drill sergeant Fuck this E P dawg, you need a real album A deal with 'em Malcolm And a pill problem, again To go and  get your face off the milk carton You've been on since you been starting All that sobriety shit Dieting trying to quit Fighting and hiding out from society sick Come back parting your head to the side and it slit It's so exciting when all the girls are riding your dick Look what your writing, it's falling off a cliff You know the cure for that though Go get an eight ball and a fifth Pour the Jamie, light a smoke, take a whole and a sniff Birthed with the curse and cursed to call it a gift Fuck the bullshit talk and all this positiveness Your heart's in the right place, we'll give your jaws an assist But lets get back to this madness, back to this money Back to these habits that I have to become me I can almost feel the fire burning back in my stomach Heard the whispers of the public and they practically hung me They said I had a good run, I would fly some Then crash and burn they say the good die young The thought of it made him bang his head It's the word on the street, it's spread That Slaine is deadBroken dreams I’ll follow mine To the end of my borrowed time I’ve been walking down this road too long Got my bags packed and I hit the door Then I make a stop at the liquor store Cause my will is weak but my whiskey is strong Yeah, through the fights, drama, and heartbreak yeah the winter is cold I put my faith in the forgiveness, every sinner is owed Flashback when we was teens, just beginning the road Before the lights, camera, and action and the glittering gold Before the ‘caine spots, before the overdoses and aimed Glocks Before my name popped, before the Navigator raindrops Before I started back with the bad habits, I can’t stop I said I’d keep going, told you I can’t stop And that’s what made me who I am, but it did us in You can never see through the clouds my head is in I was sick and got addicted to my medicine I was a prick, I kept on kicking 'till they let us in And once they let me in the door it was war With the world I was sure couldn’t go back to before Ever since we were kids they said we shouldn’t mix And at the end we broke something that we couldn’t fixWhere am I supposed to go I don't think I can do this for to much longer man These are the last verses I'll ever write Lonely roads have been walked The winter has been long The ice has never melting I'm pricing my sins upon a credit card Still payin my debts, my personal health struggling Kids lookin up to me, what should I tell to them The nightmares upon me, the dirty laundry is on me I am the darkness standin amongst an army of zombies The serenade of the renegade has been sung allready And then some but then past is catchin up comin to get me People know my bloated face, everywhere I go to chase and cope I need to slow down, I need to stop It motivates my flow to space And motor races in my thoughts Moving at the speed of light, I can't slow tha pace Mommy cryin on the phone, wifey kicked me out the crib Strangers wanna buy me drinks, write about the life I live Push me deeper down, I creep around in this isolation But what am I after now  What is this life I'm chasing
