Life is a mystery Everyone must stand alone I hear you call my name And it feels like home When you call my name It's like a little prayer I'm down on my knees I want to take you there In the midnight hour I can feel your power Just like a prayer You know I'll take you there I hear your voice It's like an angel sighing I have no choice I hear your voice Feels like flying I close my eyes Oh God, I think I'm falling Out of the sky I close my eyes Heaven, help meStrike a pose Strike a pose Vogue Vogue Look around, everywhere you turn is heartache It's everywhere that you go You try everything you can to escape The pain of life that you know When all else fails and you long to be Something better than you are today I know a place where you can get away It's called a dance floor And here's what it's for, so Come on, vogue Let your body move to the music Hey, hey, hey Come on, vogue Let your body go with the flow You know you can do it¿Cómo puede ser verdad Last night I dreamt of San Pedro Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song Young girl with eyes like the desert It all seems like yesterday, not far away Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita And when the samba played, the sun would set so high Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby I fell in love with San Pedro Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me Te dijo, "Te amo"I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita And when the samba played, the sun would set so high Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullabySome boys kiss me, some boys hug me I think they're okay If they don't give me proper credit, I just walk away They can beg and they can plead But they can't see the light 'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always Mister Right'Cause we are living in a material world And I am a material girl You know that we are living in a material world And I am a material girl Some boys romance, some boys slow dance That's all right with me If they can't raise my interest, then I have to let them be Some boys try, and some boys lie But I don't let them play, no way Only boys that save their pennies make my rainy day'Cause we are living in a material world And I am a material girl You know that we are living in a material world And I am a material girl Living in a material world And I am a material girl You know that we are living in a material world And I am a material girlOoh, la, la Ooh, la, la,
