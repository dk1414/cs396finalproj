Bang, bang Could a body close the mind down Stitch a seam across the eye If you can be good, you'll live forever If you're bad, you'll die when you die Hearing only one true note On the one and only sound Unzip my body, take my heart out'Cause I need a beat to give this tune Taking a picture Taking a picture Taking a picture Bang, bang Oh, the body swayed to music Oh, the lightning glance I would give it all and all Maybe you would hear me ask for half a chance Hearing only one root note Planted firmly in the ground Undo my heart, unzip my body and Lend to my ear a clear and a deafening sound Unzip my heartWhen I think that I'm over you I'm overpowered Your data, my data The chromosomes match Exact as in matter A matter of fact These amaranth feelings A cognitive state Need the love object To reciprocate When I think that I'm over you I'm overpowered It's long overdue I'm overpowered When I think that I'm over you I'm overpowered It's long overdue I'm overpowered As science struggles on to try to explain Oxytoxins flowing ever into my brain As science struggles on to try to explain Oxytoxins flowing ever into my brainI feel my story's still untold But I'll make my own happy ending I guess I'd rather be alone Then making do and mending I think maybe I've outgrown this old town I see you almost every day And every time I turn around Our love is stuck on replay Ever since we broke up I've been afraid to go out But I won't be a prisoner Locked up in this house I feel my story's still untold And I'll make my own happy ending But I'd rather be alone Than making do and mending Have I outgrown this old town I see you almost every day And every time I turn around Our love is stuck on replayLet's ride ten miles up Just inside the stratosphere More sky, more blue jets Stream by, you're gonna love it here Let's fly ten miles up Just outside the atmosphere We'll climb, oh, straight up Set aside irrational fear Goodbye, oh, to a cruel world Never again will I ever be grounded on Earth, or be bound by the hurt in your Blue eyes, oh for a brave new world Out in the starry skies, our paradise found And as we rise so far above Our little lights in miniature Believe your eyes can be transfixed Knock, knock, knock it down, your heavenly door One mile in, it keeps pulling me back Have you got to ?Higher now, there's no turning back Gone in the blink of an eyeNarcissus, Narcissus, Narcissus Be in love, be in love, be in love Be in love, be in love, be in love with me Be in love, be in love, be in love Be in love, be in love, be in love with me Be in love, be in love,

Narcissus The saddest story ever told The perfect glory, so all alone And I could love you till kingdom come I might not deserve you, but save you from The saddest story ever told Loving only what you behold In your own reflection when love is here In all your pretension, I hold you dear The saddest story ever told The narcissistic glory to be all alone And I could show you, listen to what I say To feel real love is to give it away A happy ending would never be, Narcissus dyingI want something more I want something more I want something more I want something more I want something more I want

something, give me something Give me something, give me something Give me something, give me something Give me something, give me something Give me something, give me something A crown upon my head, ten lovers in my bed But I want something more A billion in the bank, titles of higher rank But I want something more A castle deep in Spain, more land than Charlemagne And boys who ease the pain An island out at sea, a house of luxury And it's all named after meAncora tu Non mi sorprende, lo sai Ancora tu Ma non dovevamo vederci più E come stai  Domanda inutile Stai come me e ci scappa da ridere Amore mio, hai già mangiato o no Ho fame anch'io e non soltanto di te Che bella sei, sembri più giovane O forse sei solo più simpatica Oh, lo so Cosa tu vuoi sapere Nessuna, no Ho solo ripreso a fumare Sei ancora tu, purtroppo l'unica Ancora tu, l'incorreggibile Ma lasciarti non è possibile No, lasciarti non è possibile Lasciarti non è possibile No, lasciarti non è possibile Sei ancora tu, purtroppo l'unica Ancora tu, incorreggibileI feel my story's still untold But I'll make my own happy ending This is a simulation This is a simulation This is a simulation This is for demonstration This is a simulation This is a simulation This is a simulation This is for demonstration This is a simulation This is for demonstration This is a lonely illusion This is my only delusion This is the realm of my wildest dreams These are my wildest dreams If it's all on my face It's all in my mind You don't get to be unkind This is a simulation This is for demonstration This is a lonely illusion This is my only delusion This is the realm of my wildest dreams These are my wildest dreams If it's all on my face It's all in my mind You don't get to let it slide You don't get to let it slideIt's gone cold, it's horrible weather It's gone stone cold and you know we should've got it together Well, it's nice, it's nice to be wanted But I want to want you too and never be frightened Never had a broken heart Never seen me fall apart Haven't got a broken dream Not that into crazy scenes Don't know where I get the strength And I go out of my head I'm not even out of breath I could go forever, yeah Never had a broken heart Am I incapable of love Never seen me fall apart I must be incapable of love Never had a broken heart Yet I'm unavailable for love And I should try and play my part But I'm incapableIt all came down to that one night in question Intentionally I believe my demise Was my own stupid invention With wide open eyes, I said goodbye to the guys And set sail for my destruction I was functioning then, as I'm functioning now Way below my potential Scared out of my mind Going inside without too much hesitation Rendered defenseless at the slightest hint of suggestion I'm petrified, and I'm fucked if I do, and I'm fucked if I don't Accept defeat and kiss the feet of oblivion I've waited for too long for something wrong Somewhat expectantly And I told myself lies if I'm lying around And it don't trickle down in the same direction I was reckless to dissolve at your resolve To make an object of attraction But dissatisfaction pushed me over a cliff edge And there will be no cold retraction But I crossed the room with every knowledge of your cold But I hope that I could make a spun without it catching up on I'll go With your master plan I'll be putty in your hands You're the mastermind
