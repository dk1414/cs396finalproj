Before the story begins Is it such a sin For me to take what's mine Until the end of time We were more than friends Before the story ends And I will take what's mine Create what God would never design Our love had been so strong for far too long I was weak with fear that something would go wrong Before the possibilities came true I took all possibility from you Almost laughed myself to tears Conjuring her deepest fears Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times I can't believe it Ripped her heart out right before her eyes Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it She was never this good in bed even when she was sleeping Now she's just so perfect, I've never been quite so fucking deep in It goes on and on, and on I can keep you looking young and preserved forever With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold That's why I got a heater for your thighs And I know, I know it's not your time but bye, bye And a word to the wise when the fire dies You think it's over but it's just begun Baby don't cry You had my heart, at least for the most part'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime We fell apart, let's make a new start'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah yeah But baby don't cry Now possibilities I'd never considered Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave To repossess a body with which I misbehave Smiling right from ear to ear Almost laughed herself to tearsNever feared for anything Never shamed but never free A life that healed the broken heart with all that it could Lived a life so endlessly Saw beyond what others see I tried to heal your broken heart with all that I could Will you stay Will you stay away forever How do I live without the ones I love Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned Place and time always on my mind I have so much to say but you're so far away Plans of what our futures hold Foolish lies of growin' old It seems we're so invincible, the truth is so cold A final song, a last request A perfect chapter laid to rest Now and then I try to find a place in my mind Where you can stay You can stay awake forever How do I live without the ones I love Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned Place and time always on my mind I have so much to say but you're so far away Sleep tight, I'm not afraid The ones that we love are here with me Lay away a place for me'Cause as soon as I'm done, I'll be on my way To live eternally How do I live without the ones I love Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned Place and time always on my mind And the light you left remains but it’s so hard to stay When I have so much to say and you’re so far away I love you, you were ready The pain is strong and urges rise But I'll see you when He lets me Your pain is gone, your hands untied So far away And I need you to know So far away And I need you to, need you to knowSo I arrived, naked and cold A welcomed change from the abeyance of a ghost town catacomb No need for counsel, I appreciate the time, I'm not alone There were days these child eyes Would overlook the ugliness and fantasize I found my heart for the first time and I awakened in me I left myself to navigate and oh I felt control Who is the crowd that peers through the cage As we perform here upon the stage As the boy became a man In came a calm sophistication I can hardly understand So lost in ego, didn't notice when the time had slipped away Jesus Christ was born to die Leave it to man to levitate his own to idolize We're simply sociopaths with no communication, baby I see your angle but we differ from our points of viewNightmare!Now your nightmare comes to life Dragged ya down below, down to the devil's show To be his guest forever Hate to twist your mind, but God ain't on your side An old acquaintance severed Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air'Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head You're now a slave until the end of time here Nothing stops the madness turning, haunting, yearning pull the trigger You should have known the price of evil And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare While your nightmare comes to life Can't wake up in sweat, 'cause it ain't over yet Still dancing with your demons Beyond the will to fight, where all that's wrong is right Where hate don't need a reason You've been lied to just to rape you of your sight And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel So sedated as they medicate your brain And while you slowly go insane they tell you:"Given with the best intentions, help you with your complications"Watch your tongue or have it cut from your head Save your life by keeping whispers unsaid Children roam the streets, now orphans of war Bodies hanging in the streets to adore Royal flames will carve the path in chaos Bringing daylight to the night Death is riding into town with armor They come to take all your rights Hail to the king Hail to the one Kneel to the crown Stand in the sun Hail to the king The King Blood is spilled while holding keys to the throne Born again but it’s too late to atone No mercy from the edge of the blade Dare escape and learn the price to be paid Let the water flow with shades of red, now Arrows black out all the light Death is riding into town with armor They come to grant you your rightsA lonely road, crossed another cold state line Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find While I recall all the words you spoke to me Can't help but wish that I was there At where I'd love to be, oh yeah Dear God, the only thing I ask of you Is to hold her when I'm not around When I'm much too far away We all need that person who can be true to you But I left her when I found her And now I wish I'd stayed'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired I'm missing you again, oh no Once again There's nothing here for me, on this barren road There's no one here while the city sleeps And all the shops are closed Can't help but think of the times I've had with you Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh yeah Dear God, the only thing I ask of you Is to hold her when I'm not around When I'm much too far away We all need that person who can be true to you But I left her when I found her And now I wish I'd stayed'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired I'm missing you again, oh no Once againOur truth is painted across the sky In our reflection we learn to fly No hand to hold us No one to save us from tomorrow Sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone Far beyond the dreams of everyone No light to follow A shot in the dark Does anybody know Sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone Far beyond the dreams of everyone High from the heavens I can't see the pain Does anybody care Think for a moment of all the lives Stripped of their essence before their time We stand to conquer But is there nothing left tomorrow Like walking into a dream, so unlike what you've seen So unsure but it seems, 'cause we've been waiting for you Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste Of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway I see a distant light, but girl, this can't be right Such a surreal place to see, so how did this come to be Arrived too early And when I think of all the places I just don't belong I've come to grips with life and realize this is going too far I don't belong here, we gotta move on, dear Escape from this afterlife'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on Far away from here A place of hope and no pain, perfect skies with no rain Can leave this place but refrain, 'cause we've been waiting for you Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste Of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway This peace on Earth's not right No pain or sign of time So out of place, don't wanna stay, I feel wrong and that's my sign I've made up my mindHe who makes a beast out of himself Gets rid of the pain of being a man Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay I tried, to drive all through the night The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights No oasis, here to see The sand is singing deathless words to me Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn  Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction My confidence is leaving me on my own No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention As I, adjust to my new sights The rarely tired lights, will take me to new heights My hand is on the trigger, I'm ready to ignite Tomorrow might not make it, but everything's all right Mental fiction, follow me Show me what it's like to be set free Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn  Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction My confidence is leaving me on my own No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attentionLet's take a moment and break the ice So my intentions are known See I have pity in watching you suffer I know the feeling of being damned alone I've got a storybook of my own Don't you see I am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs I am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak Know me by name, Shepherd of Fire Well I can promise you paradise No need to serve on your knees And when you're lost in the darkest of hours Take a moment and tell me who you see Won't tell you who not to be Now you know I am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs I am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak Know me by name, Shepherd of Fire
