I had a dream last night We drove out to see Las Vegas We lost ourselves in the bright lights I wish you could have seen us Begging for change to get home Or at least San Francisco Let's put a ten on the high card And spend a summer on the West Coast Down and to the left Here's a map and a pen, the place you pointed at Be California's best All I ask, all I ask Hey, please don't tell me that I'm dreaming When all I ever wanted was to Dream another sunset with you If I roll over when it's over I'll take this Cali sunrise with me And wake up with the fondest memories We made love by the ocean As the waves crashed around you Sunsets never were so bright And the skies, never so blue You opened up into my arms And we laughed as I held you I'll never go back to Georgia Not at least 'til I have toKaty, don't cry, I know You're trying your hardest, and the hardest part is letting Go of the nights we shared Ocala is calling, and you know it's haunting But compared to your eyes Nothing shines quite as bright And when we look to the sky It's not mine, but I want it so Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight I know he's there and You're probably hanging out and making eyes While across the room he stares I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor And ask my girl to dance She'll say yes Because these words were never easier For me to say or her to second guess, but I guess That I can live without you but Without you, I'll be miserable at best You're all that I hoped I'd find in every single way And everything I would give is everything you couldn't take'Cause nothing feels like home, you're a thousand miles away And the hardest part of living is just taking breaths to stay'Cause I know I'm good for something, I just haven't found it yet But I need it, soBy the time I was your age, I'd give anything To fall in love truly, was all I could think That's when I met your mother, the girl of my dreams The most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen She said, "Boy can I tell you a wonderful thing I can't help but notice, you're staring at me I know I shouldn't say this, but I really believe I can tell by your eyes that you're in love with me."Now, son, I'm only telling you this Because life can do terrible things Now, most of the time we'd have too much to drink And we'd laugh at the stars and we'd share everything Too young to notice and too dumb to care Love was a story that couldn't compare I said, "Girl, can I tell you a wonderful thing I made you a present with paper and string Open with care now, I'm asking you, please You know that I love you, will you marry me "Now, son, I'm only telling you this Because life can do terrible things You'll learn, one day, I'll hope and I'll pray That God shows you differentlyGive me your misery, all of it give it to me I can hold onto it for you, it’s not a problem I just want your energy, a piece of that fractured mountain I’ll take whatever comes with it as long as it’s yours And all I know is that I want it more than yesterday If I was waiting, I was waiting for just one little spark You are the brightest I’ve seen, you are the best side of me And just for when we’re apart I’ve got a piece of your heart But I want the whole damn thing I feel it inside of me, I feel it inside of you too Seeing forever this downcast bleed from the sky Could never sever through, not what we have me and you Burning together and burning forever And I don’t know, I just can feel it in the atmosphere If I’m wandering, I’ve wandered into just the right spot You are the fire in my sleep, you are the reason I dream And just for when we’re apart I’ve got a piece of your heart I’ve got a piece of your heart, but I want the whole damn thing Say hello to all my problems for me Tell them sorry, I can’t be around anymore The years will go on, we’ll get older and then we’ll die But we’ll get byI swear that you don't have to go I thought we could wait for the fireworks I thought we could wait for the snow To wash over Georgia and kill the hurt I thought I could live in your arms And spend every moment I had with you Stay up all night with the stars Confess all the faith that I had in you Too late, I'm sure and lonely Another night, another dream wasted on you Just be here now against me You know the words, so sing along for me, baby For heaven's sake I know you're sorry But you won't stop crying This anniversary may never be the same Inside I hope you know I'm dying With my heart beside me In shattered pieces that may never be replaced And if I died right now you'd never be the same I thought with a month of apart Together would find us an opening And moonlight would provide the spark And that I would stumble across the key Or break down the door to your heart Forever could see us - not you and me And you'd help me out of the dark And I'd give my heart as an offering And honestly I have been begging for answers That you and only you can give to me My voice crying loud I've been crying for days now And as I start to run, I stop to breathe And I was nearly scared to death Of why you left in paragraphs The words were nearly over us You stop and turn and grab your bags And I'll be here by the ocean Just waiting for proof that there's sunsets and silhouette dreams All my sandcastles fall like the ashes of cigarettes And every wave drags me to sea I could stand here for hours Just to ask God the question, "Is everyone here make-believe "With a tear in His voice, He says, "Son, that's the question."Does this deafening silence mean nothing to no one but me When you're alone, do you think of me And my diamond ring's thrown out to sea And when you love, do you love for me Like harmony, a never ending dream Oh well, oh well I still hope for the best Say goodbye send me off with a kiss farewell And I promise I'll be just as strong as I can be Maybe you could get some sleep tonight So here's your song It's twisting me I'd give anything to make you scream And I'll just smile, and make believe I don't feel a thing That doesn't work for me Oh well, oh well Guess I'll see you in hell There's a pretty little picture that's in my head And I'm starting to dream, changing colors while I sleep Maybe I'm just wasting timeThe words are coming, I feel terrible Is it typical for us to end like this Am I just another scene from a movie that you've seen One hundred times Cause baby you weren't the first or the last or the worst And I've got to fill the blanks in the past with a verse And we could sit around and cry but frankly You're not worth it anymore So say hello to all the boys at the top Of this table that you're under Lipstick lullabies This is sorry for the last time And baby I understand that you're making new friends This is how you get by The moral this time is:Girls make boys cry, and I...On any other day I'd shoot the boy But your simple toy had caused a scene like this Leave him hanging on the walls, just a picture in the hall Like a hundred more Consider this as a gift as you taste him on your lips And he's making you scream with his hands on your hips I hope he's leaving you empty baby this is just a fix Such a simple little whoreTo be alone together just once again Is something that is sure to happen sometime If my hands can't stay on the table And if I find myself unable To look away from staring in your eyes And the color of the sunrise inside I promise that I'll hold myself together And act like this isn't killing me I saw you once today I painfully watched as you looked the other way Afraid just to notice me standing there You would make it obvious, you don't care I won't lie, I only love you for the heartbreak I only love you for the give and the take No, you know I want it I'm in love with the thought of everything I am lifted to a holy ground And from up here can see a little of everything And I can see you don't want me around And I know how much that it makes you cringe To think about you and I as friends Together, forever, until the end After that, you won't have to see me againI'm throwing away pictures That I never should have taken in the first place And it's cold in my apartment As I'm changing all the colors From the brightest reds to grays Well it's 3 o'clock on Monday morning I'm just hoping you're not seeing his face I've been getting calls in these hotel rooms Long enough to know that it was him That took my place And I hope this makes you happy now That the flame we had is burning out And I hope you like your pictures facing down As even broken hearts may have their doubts And I'm burning all the letters Hoping that I might forget her and the bad taste That she left when she was leaving me A life of barely breathing as she walked Out of this place And you dropped the note and we changed key You changed yourself and I changed me I really didn't see us singing through this Then you screamed the bridge And I cried the verse And our chorus came out unrehearsed And you smiled the whole way through it I guess maybe that's what's worse
