Say you love me to my face I need it more than your embrace Just say you want me, that's all it takes Heart's gettin' torn from your mistakes'Cause I don't wanna fall in love if you don't wanna try But all that I've been thinking of is maybe that you might Baby it looks as though we're running out of words to say And love's floatin' away Just say you love me, just for today And don't give me time cause that's not the same I want to feel burning flames when you say my name I want to feel passion flow into my bones like blood through my veins'Cause I don't wanna fall in love if you don't wanna try But all that I've been thinking of is maybe that you might Baby it looks as though we're running out of words to say And love's floatin' away Won't you stay  Won't you stay Slowly, slowly you unfold me But do you know me at all Someone told me love controls everything But only if you knowBaby, let's be honest about this There's only room for one in your heart So tell me, darlin', why are we like this I must admit that I kind of like it Oh, you're acting sweet I know what that means All these games we play Always end the same Selfish love, why do I do these things I break you down, just to get my way Selfish love, darlin', you do it too You tell me lies and I bend the truth And I, I know That I can't get enough Selfish love Baby, now it feels like we're dancing Dodging bullets, now ain't that romantic Take what I want, but you want me to take it I only give love when I want to make itAin't enough to say that I think of you Words can never do the things that I need them to Tell me when I'll get more than a dream of you'Cause a dream is just a dream and I don't wanna sleep tonight Do anything to make you stay Do anything to start the day again If I had everything my way We'd travel back and forth and back again If only I could let you go If only I could be alone I just wanna stay in the moonlight This is our time, in the spotlight If only I could let you go If only I could be alone I just wanna stay in the moonlight This is our time, in the spotlight You and I, bloodlines We come together every time Two wrongs, no rights We lose ourselves at night From the outside, from the outside Everyone must be wondering why we try Why do we try Baby, in our wildest moments We could be the greatest, we could be the greatest Maybe in our wildest moments We could be the worst of all Baby, in our wildest moments We could be the greatest, we could be the greatest Maybe in our wildest moments We could be the worst of all Wait on, thunder sky Wherever there’s smoke, there'll soon be fire What could bring bad luck I’ve been looking at you too muchOoh-ooh Ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh I can tell we've got potential Is this love too hot to handle Make a wish, blow out my candle Make a wish for me Show me you can listen closely Tell me you can take it slowly That's the way to get to know me Get to know me I know the way to make you happy I give you love, you give it back to me You can't deny this perfect symmetry Just what I need, just what I need Come on now Push, press, more, less Here together, what's your pleasure Stop, go, fast, slow Here together, what's your pleasure Here together, what's your pleasure Here together, what's your pleasure Oh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh Take the weight off my shoulders Say, I won't make the same mistakes when we're older'Cause with every step you take I'm getting colder So come a little closer, just come a little closer I don't want somebody else to call my name No, I don't want somebody else when you could just say Say that you're the one who's taking me home'Cause I want you on my skin and my bones Knocking me off my feet Just say I'm the one that you need, oh, please Say that you're the one who's taking me home So I can get you alone Oh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh Oh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh Just wanna talk a little longer So, baby, don't you wanna stay a little later 'Cause I could watch you watch me forever'Cause I know you better And you know I neverWhose fault is this That I'm crazy about you You are there in every single dream And I'm thinking about you If you wanna do-do-do me right Do-do-do-do-do If you wanna leave it all tonight Do-do-do-do-do When there's nothing left Except you and these Champagne kisses Champagne kisses Champagne When there's nothing left Except you and these Champagne kisses Champagne kisses Champagne I count every kiss Till I'm finally sleeping This love's supreme That's why I'll always give inIt’s already the time that you'll hope my mind is true And I’ve been thinking 'bout what to say or not to do So you wanna be a man about it, do you And have you figured out all you wanted, have you When your heart becomes a million different pieces That's when you won't be able to recognise this feeling That’s called tough love That’s called tough love That’s called tough love That’s called tough love In the middle of the night all I think about is you I dream in all your clouds of glory, it's true So you wanna be a man about it, do you have to And have you figured out all you wanted, have you When your heart becomes a million different pieces That's when you won't be able to recognise this feelingOne, two, three Sat inside a railway station Drinking a cup of coffee on my own Listening to the strangest conversation About children and holidays in Rome Last night I sat inside a bar room And I was thinking 'bout my childhood home I think I need to talk to mama'Cause I'm about to have a child all of my own And I hope I'm as brave as my mother Wondering what kind of mother will I be I hope she knows that I found a man far from my father Sam, my baby, and me I've been thinking about my husband From seventeen, the only love I've known And I could place no one above him So beautiful and so naive alone I've not even called my family About the life that's 'bout to find me home For many years, the lights would blind me But now I find they only want to lead me homeSo, will you never be my lover or my valentine Never be a friend of mine Never see my better side Baby, you'd be terrified Of all the secrets you were wishing You won't ever find Is deep inside me And I don't wanna hide me'Cause I know about my love'Cause I know about my love'Cause I know about my love Cause I know about my love Yeah Pick up fast and I could fly far away from here , oh Although I know I feel at home whenever you are near Boo, I love you but I can't cold-cut to this , oh I wish you'd hold me open and just to see your vision clear, oh 'Cause I know about my love 'Cause I know about my love 'Cause I know about my love 'Cause I know about my love
