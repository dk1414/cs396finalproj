Shitters is sad, wonder if deals an option If  I turn a profit bout six and a half Thoughts of a young niggas Saw the valley of a man who's guns bigga And the change in the whip for the drug dealer In the valley of the damned i'm a sun singer Nigga i'm hope Nigga i'm broke Really had faith I never been a pope Nights without water had to dance in the rain to wash away the pain but  I didn't have soap Didn't have coats for the winter Got me ready for this cold world shivers Insoles got my skin a lot thicker These foes now my fist a lot quicker Nigga i'm rivers its trainin' time Product of the block and a niggas popping shots with no aim this time Its either be a  with some tripple with the rock for the fame this time uh, uh Its in my veins this time uh, uh Its in my pain this time uh, yes It pays to rhyme Its been a long time no more patience timeI look into my past and I can barely force a smile The common misconceptions that parents afford a child From the fires of experience happiness hand me downs And the wisdom you acquire not angry and actin' wild You're worse than the bullies, the rapists and pedophiles It's you that we should trust to protect us and make us proud I just try to be the man that you presented to me Not the man that you showed your friends and you pretended to be I looking mami's eyes and say "I kill' em if I could"But I'm too damn weak and small and I'm not sure if I even should But I've seen what he's done to you And I know it isn't good If I could be a shining armor, I swear to god that I would And I wish I said more things but I was young and I was voiceless And I couldn't find the words that Made you feel like they were choices Make you feel like you were priceless When you petrified with fear Go tell my sistas and my moms, just know I'm stronger and I'm here Are you brave in the dark, are you brave Are you brave in the dark Are you king when the lights on Are you brave in the dark, are you brave Are you brave in the dark Are you king when the lights on Are you brave in the dark, are you brave Are you brave in the dark Are you king when the lights on Are you brave in the dark, are you brave Are you brave in the dark Are you king when the lights onWaking up to see that everything is okay The first time in my life and now it’s so great Slowing down I look around And I am so amazed I think about the little things that make life great I wouldn’t change a thing about it So as my pen would meet the page I see that I have been encaged Locked inside the gates of rage I pray that this is just a phase Camera lights don’t penetrate I see the shade upon the stage And a world that needs a save because the darkness is embraced I heard the screams and seen the murder scenes Fiends who burn and hurt your dreams Need morphine for the pain that’s warping feeling like an offering Created god for moral comforting but treats us like we’re lesser beings If this world was perfect yes you heard it wouldn’t change a thing And the murderers and burglars they take away this And the rapists and the racists yeah they take away this And the greedy and misleading yeah they take away this This innocence Now the seas are rising climbing 'til they reach the skies Disguising, as we reach for light we’re touching darkness, death and violence I think life just needs defining and this world just needs refining Need to read between the lines Not spread lies and then defiance Spread some peace and love and science and the knowledge to apply it Realize each of us are small but as a unit we are giant I am making my deposit but I’m withdrawing my conscious Cause I put my heart into it but my brain is still deciding I am drowning in this silence Where the fuck is this Poseidon Yeah we pray but we need guidance like a homo needs a closet It’s irrelevant Claim that you are heaven sent But everyone is equal, disagree you lack intelligence Blinded by your negligence Blinded by these necklaces Message is in this world it seems that only death is the perfectionistI was the perfect adolescence, not content with no connections Pressin' the wrong direction with pain was my only entrance My life felt like a death sentence, and this is not a wild excuse Actin' anti-social was a product of the child abuse Attackin' what was hopeful was a kind of thought through logical Neglect was like a  to me, suicide so optional From happiness to thoughts that I'll be dead up in the hospital It felt like I was fucked like those visions thought were conjugal But I guess I had to constitute my actions or my common move But I felt I had no reason, crippled though, that I could do Now, I'm not a quitter, but it's quicker than impossible You cannot be a winner when your inner self is stoppin' you My confidence was shiftin' like the continents of pangea Padded out, I'm witnessed by my pieces like a band leader First suicide attempt at eight, hangin' from the ceilin' fan Obvious that it collapsed, I'm starin' at the ceilin' and Wishin' I was someone else, wishin' I had better days Wishin' I could end my life, but wishin' there was better ways Flash forward to fifteen, second suicide attempt Standin' at the edge of the platform tryin' to catch my breath Just tryin' to find the courage to jump on the tracks, but was nervous to–My heartbeat was so loud that the train came and I never heard it come My reflection in the passin' window, damn, I look so worthless Thought about the late train service, but figured I wasn't worthless So stepped on, felt alone in a crowded cart My brainstormin' it was reflectin' my clouded heart Said, "Fuck it", I started fuckin'Fell in love and started cuffin'But didn't realize that cuffin' went hand-in-hand with the customs Grew accustomed to someone by my side, but then I realized that every relationship gets pulled apart by the ties So, take this broken heart for liftin' this girl up And had a broken back from fuckin' liftin' this world up They had on bein' homeless Said, "Hey, fuck it  This world sucks", same shit Different toliet that just managed to swirl up Now, I'm seventeen, just walkin' 'round collectin' my thoughts Suicide note already written, all that's missin's a corpse My phone rings, I let it ring, I'm on a mission of course And any of the stress is goin' to leave till we mission abort Focus, fuck, Chris focus, you can do this You're a coward and a pussy, but most of all you are useless Reach my hand right past the gate and touched the door that says has vultures Which made sense 'cause you had been deprived of sparks since you were broken Baby, breathin', chokin' on your blood and teeth While you were standin' up for sisters and your mother Gettin' beat and now you're weak And then you couldn't save nobody, that goes double for yourself Without your fat-ass mom to feed your mom, could double up her wealth Now, I'm reachin' even closer, few more inches and I'm dead Then an image of my nephew probably popped right in my head Now, I see my will is breakin'Breakin' sweats, my hand is shakin'It's people walkin' by, they look right at me then keep pacin'Mind is racin', I've been patient like, do I deserve this shit I prefer the worthlessness, but do I deserve to live Now, emotionless, waves of emotions fillin' an ocean A hopeless is hopin' this shit passes and crashes on shorelines Feelin' assured lines, like love yourself is a crime So I should serve my time and live my life for youSo give me recognition, Hip Hop now is an exhibition In exorcism of niggas spitting less than the best is given The next edition and twist the rappers are less efficient Than Rivers that’s hitting visions, my verses are premonitions Gimme minds, I eat rappers whole: gimme lines Galactics of this rap shit, my tactics I intertwine What’s in his minds is thinner time  Nigga you hear the time Been spittin’ divine, since the dawn of existence and time Witness the rhyme, Lamar you set the bar high See it's  hard as the dark side Dragon's are like the court-room figure we all rise Fly as high the sky, the skies Acknowledge my potential, demolishing art and temples Undermine the underdog and I swear to God I’ll be vengeful They got more stars and stripes, but I got more heart and more mental So if you ever count me out, I will do my part and will end you Game of Thrones  More like the game of bones, my crown is my city Maybe self-proclaimed for now, but I hold it down 'til they wit’ me50-50 I’ll either be  king, but I swiftly pick up Excalibur My calibre is torturin’ Achilles And killin’ Arthur, the kind of slaughter you hide from ya daughters The author of the highest order labelled me to destroy ya I thought I told ya, a soldier with the weight of worlds on his shoulders But breaking boulders with bare hands, while walkin’ on water Something to talk about, so put me in conversations The kind of greatness, you witness once in a constellation My combination is dark and blatant, incarcerated with hatred As compensation destroy you for confirmation Gotta prove myself, I’m a loser in stealth Tryna say I couldn't hang; I'm like a noose, two pelts Around the neck, of a dude that tried to douse himself‘Cause he took in all the pain that this mu-sic felt Rappers are slackers, we’ll summon ‘til this reason attract us Spitting disasters force him to acknowledge that factor And so hip hop ain't dead it's just looking for masses I'm in this shit to win and we can shake hands afterWoe is me and yes you left my heart in pain Frozen overflowing oceans now just clog my brain Drowning in the thought that we will never be the same You chose the potion over family, for that I'm so ashamed This honey elixir is thicker than blood you figure Brothers mothers sisters run thinner inside your liver Me as your father bothered the farther you go it's harder to harbor these waves get Larger for starters said fuck this picture Fucking quitter You realize all the things you had in store !You once had dreams like that of kings but you gave up queens to love a whore But now your poor knocking on the door to kingdoms unexplored Your future was so golden like Midas tried and write your final score I watched you grow from chromosomes to bones and traits of human beings But this honey in your soul has grown and now it pulls the strings And of course we want to see you high but these drugs are foolish wings So when your crashing from the sky just know we love you when we sing sing You left my heart in pain Hanged through the darkest rain Drained through the largest veins Change was the hardest thing And these endorphins pumped inside are dormant hiding all my torment Engaged to new bad habits now that seem to need divorcing Like a headless Horseman cause my hearts asleep and hollow Need to burrow sorrow mine will stretch indefinite like no tomorrow And though it's vital Can't answer things like "who's your idol"Life has got me suicidal need distractions for survival They say I should read the Bible But no I'm taking needles, getting higher than an eagle So I stand with God as equals, without the honey I feel feeble That's why I'm getting high And I would hide inside the sky, because to dive would be with people And all they did was judge me claiming that they fucking loved me But if they did, then why persist in tryna take me from my honey But now my lovely's just a memory Flew too high and burnt my feathered wings So when I crash upon the mezzanine Don't laugh just nod your head and singIntro:Wait, where am I I can't feel my soul All systems go Prepare for elevation Verse 1:Back at it I never left though Always followed up the bars like Esco In the middle of this joint like an elbow Getting high   Sure as hell flow I am alkaline, like alpha mine, an alpha mind In half the time I average rhymes that paradigms They can't define They haven't tried but if they did then it's a dub like I remember feeling like a bitch I remember crushing on bands I remember crushing on fans I remember crushing on plans I ain't get to kiss and hold hands Now she suckin dick with no hands Turn tables, turnin tables, heard the fable, words are hateful, turning grateful, spinning stories, heard the dreidel, scream cause the five shots curve is fatal I'm nothing like you, I smile in pictures with gangsters I never leave home with a banger I found me a ho like Topanga That's also a woman, I hold her real close like this I don't want 'formance, I probably cop me a railer Brush up these haters like pay us Been opening doors up for strangers And really do care about matesI been numba one for a while now uh i been numba one Switch kick, flip bricks, kiss chicks, lick clits Quick with the penmanship flow switch like Jenner did Prime era, divine terror, find it in the eyes of the guys who fight my era Einsteins mind resides in my mirror I been in my prime since a sperm a fine swimma'Sick with it illest with lyrics my spits different As Viscous light a spliff for my sis i'm a bit lifted A bit gifted like six Christmas'It's bliss Chris got a dick to hit bitches with Who in the east could jot fluently congruently the true M C's no tomfoolery palm brewery Gettin' drunk off my thoughts nigga It's not a sip though Shock the block, i rock the jaguar type apocolypto Don't got a Glock I rock ya top with fire fists and sick flow Shit I was poor as fuck in dodge while beggin' for the mitt though They quick to deny you when they know your arival is the truth Im the one, one, one They quick to deprive you, but how you survive through is the proof Im the one one one Im never gone change on em' but I show the difference between the difference Im the one one one And if you throw shame on em just focus ya mission in my vision Im the one one one
