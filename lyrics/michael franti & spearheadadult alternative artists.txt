Ayy, uh-huh, woo Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Uh-huh, uh-huh This one goes out to you and yours, worldwide I say, "Hey, I'll be gone today But I'll be back all around the way"It seems like everywhere I go The more I see, the less I know But I know  one thing , that I love you I love you, I love you, I love you I've been a lot of places all around the way I've seen a lot of joy, and I've seen a lot of pain But I don't want to write a love song for the world I just want to write a song about a boy and a girl Junkies on the corner always calling my name And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games When I saw you getting down, girl, I hoped it was you And when I look into your eyes, I knew it was true I say, "Hey, I'll be gone today But I'll be back all around the way" It seems like everywhere I go The more I see, the less I know But I know  one thing , that I love you I love you, I love you, I love you One, two, three, uh-huh I wake up in the morning at six o'clock They say there may be rain but the sun is hot I wish I had some time just to kill today And I wish I had it down for every bill I've got to pay Some days, you lose you win And the water's as high as the times your in So I jumped back into where I learned to swim Tried to keep my head above it the best I can That's why...Here I am Just waiting for this storm to pass me by And that's the sound, of sunshine coming down!And that's the sound, of sunshine coming down  Hey, hey, hey..  hey, hey, hey hey, hey, hey, hey One, two, three, uh-huhI got a feelin' deep within my soul And right now I really need to let to you know That each time I've fallen down inside that hole You came and showed me there's a way to go So we can love deeper Fly higher See clearer Burn brighter Feel more than we ever did before

the sunrise so I step out in the A MThe street is black and shiny from the nightly rainin'The glory of the light it brings evaporation Morning's fresh oxygen cleanest I take a deep hit help my mind stay the greenest I'm already wake so I'm not drinkin' coffee Don't wanna cigarette, cause it's a form of slavery Walk into the store cause I need a few items The sun heats my blood like a hit of vitamins Need to buy some food and some 'poo for my dreads I can't remember why but I need a spool of thread Man with dirty dreads, he steps around the corner He asks me for a dime, a nickel or a quarter I don't have any change so I'm steppin' along And as I'm walkin' past he sings to me a song...There's a hole in the bucket Dear Liza, dear Liza There's a hole in the bucket Dear Liza, dear LizaI don't eat red meat but I'm not a vegetarian I like ice cream/ but not much dairy'cause it gets in my nose It makes me gotta blows Snot like a farmer and it gets on my clothes It's rather unsightly/ can even be frightening But cold medication/ should not be taken nightly Because everything dat I put in/ it comes out again And if I eat lean/ it helps me stay thin Check out my hair, I keep it dreaded About my corn  I like it breaded Hot from the oven  M MM M  you said it!Straight to the stomach my fuel is unleaded But not fossil fuels/ I like olive oil I like my eggs scrambled/ I never eat 'em boiled The way to my heart/ is with a garlic clove It smells hella sexy/ when it's on the kitchen stove Red beans and rice, red beans and rice, red beans and rice I could eat a plate twice Red beans and rice, red beans and rice, red beans and rice Make everything nice So nice  So nice  So nice Most people on the planet/ eat beans and rice Some can't afford beef or they think cows are nice If you talk table manners don't believe all they Told ya I eat with my fingers like an African soldier I don't know which fork is for meat or for salad I haven't got a clue when they say "whet your palate"Eat a lot a prunes it'll keep you loose Skin'll turn orange if you drink carrot juice I think beef jerky tastes like a boot When I'm on the street I chew a licorice root And if I have a soar throat /then I eat ginger And I will break bread /with those who are strangers So come into my cave / tonight I will show you Food is for life / and life I will show you If you're havin' problems/ I invite you here Step into my kitchen /we will cook away your fearsEvery day's not Valentine's But you make it feel like most of the time When I'm all alone with you Pickin up pieces of my life Sometimes there's ones I just can't find But they found a home with you Woah, I'm not afraid to be alone But being alone is better with you Life is better with you Woah, woah, life is better with you Woah, woah, life is better with you And when I think about the things that we've been through I know just one thing is true, life is better with you Some days are better than other days But these days, life is better with you Some days are better than other days These days, life is better with you Life is betterHere we are Become number one, number one worldwide Number one, number one worldwide Yo, no no no no, you never know what the world is gonna show you, it ain't up to you You always think it's gonna happen to another person and it's never ever gonna happen to you You got your friends, you got your money, got your family, got your honey, you think you got a million days But when life comes your way and knocks you to the ground that's why I say, that Everybody oughta ought hug somebody at least once a day And everybody oughta kiss somebody at least once a day Everybody's gonna miss somebody at least once a day And everybody gotta love somebody every day And we all will rise, and we all will rise up And we all will rise, and we all will rise up And we all will rise, and we all will rise up And we all will rise, and we all will rise up I heard the purpose of life is to live a life full of purpose And so don't ever take for granted what the spirit is giving you In the first verse, you might never get a second verse The ain't rehearsal, you can't put it in reverse So just believe in yourself, don't let nobody be a negative Or tell you what to do Cause I know, in this sweet sweet life That just as much is trueOh my, oh my God Out here mama they got us livin' suicide singin'Oh my, oh my God Out here mama they got us livin' genocide singin'Oh my, oh my God Out here mama they got us livin' suicide singin'Oh my, oh my God, oh my God Slam bam, I come unseen But like gasoline you could tell I'm in the tank Like money in the bank I smell appealing, but I'm toxic, can send you reeling Without an inklin', keep ya thinkin'Cause you gave cash to the feds, left your school district for dead Fucked you up in the head, but still they sayin' nothin's wrong Selling firewater behind hot, loading the bomb Still believing the systems workin'While half of my people are still out of workin'Anonymous notes left in the pockets and coats Of judges and juries from 'Frisco and Jersey Threats and protests politicians mob debts Trumped up charges and phony arrests Stage a lethal injection, the night before the election Cause he got donations from the prison guard's unionI was born botanical The soul of an animal Deep beneath the layers, I sink my roots No need for mechanical I come strictly organical When I need to feast, I look to the East That's why I'm never scared of the beast Even though they try to prey upon me I'm protected by the one always greater than me So now I reveal to thee Because you wanna see The contour of my mystery The strength of my arches The colour of my conscience And the way that I process my diction Some fact some fiction some mystery Some future fantasy I'm the trunk that holds the branches The leaves who do the dances My flowers romantic My love gigantic From Africa, transplanted translantic In the heat of the sun I bring shade for everyone Like the beat on the one I'm the skin on the drumSometimes I can't breathe And when I wake up in the morning, I can't believe This whole world's crazy with emotion And I think it's coming over me Don't know how to find a relief, but in you I need help to get me through They same I'm crazy But if I'm crazy, I'm crazy for you And if we all go crazy Then I wanna go crazy, crazy with you You say that I lost my mind again Misplaced and never to find again But every morning when I look into your eyes I get the inspiration that I need to keep my soul alive In these crazy times, woah I lost my mind They same I'm crazy But if I'm crazy, I'm crazy for you And if we all go crazy Then I wanna go crazy, crazy with you Throw your hands up in the air and you can feel it coming And it goes on and it goes on until the early morning So throw your hands up in the air and you can feel it coming Down, I'm crazy for you
