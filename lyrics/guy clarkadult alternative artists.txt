I wished I was in Austin in the Chili Parlor Bar Drinking Mad Dog Margaritas and not caring where you are But here I sit in Dublin just rolling cigarettes Holding back and choking back the shakes with every breath So forgive me all my anger, forgive me all my faults There's no need to forgive me for thinking what I thought I loved you from the get go and I'll love you till I die I loved you on the Spanish Steps the day you said goodbye Now I am just a poor boy, work's my middle name If money was a reason, well, I would not be the same I'll stand up and be counted, I'll face up to the truth I'll walk away from trouble, but I can't walk away from you Forgive me all my anger, forgive me all my faults There's no need to forgive me for thinking what I thought I loved you from the get go and I'll love you till I die I loved you on the Spanish Steps the day you said goodbye I have been to Fort Worth and I have been to Spain I have been too proud to come in out of the rain I have seen the David, I've seen the Mona Lisa too I have heard Doc Watson play "Columbus Stockade Blues"My favorite picture of you is the one where you're staring Straight into the lens Just a Polaroid shot someone took on the spot No beginning, no end It's just a moment in time, you can't have back You never left, but your bags were packed Just in case My favorite picture of you is bent and it's faded And it's pinned to my wall Oh, and you were so angry It's hard to believe we were lovers at all There's a fire in your eyes, you've got your heart on your sleeve Curse on your lips, but all I can see Is beautiful My favorite picture of you Is the one where your wings are showing Oh, and your arms are crossed Your fists are clenched, not gone, but going Oh, a stand up angel who won't back down Nobody's fool, nobody's clown You were smarter than thatI'd play the Red River Valley And he'd sit in the kitchen and cry And run his fingers through seventy years of livin'And wonder, "Lord, has ever' well I've drilled gone dry "We was friends, me and this old man We was like desperados waiting for a train Like desperados waiting for a train He's a drifter and a driller of oil wells And an old school man of the world He taught me how to drive his car When he's too drunk to And he'd wink and give me money for the girls And our lives was like some old western movie Like desperados waiting for a train Like desperados waiting for a train From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe And there was old men with beer guts and dominoes Lying 'bout their lives while they'd played And I was just a kid that they all called his sidekickPack up all your dishes Make note of all good wishes And say goodbye to the landlord for me That son-of-a-bitch has always bored me Throw out all them L.A  papers And that moldy box of vanilla wafers Adios to all this concrete Gonna get me some dirt road back street If I can just get off of this L.A  freeway Without getting killed or caught I'll be down the road in a cloud of smoke To some land I ain't bought bought bought And it's Here's to you, old Skinny Dennis The only one I think I will miss I can hear that old bass singing Sweet and low like a gift you're bringing Play it for me one more time now Got to give it all we can now I believe every thing you're saying Just to keep on, keep on playingI wish I had a dime for every bad time But the bad times always seem to keep the change You've been all alone, so you know what I'm saying And when all you can recall is the pain Just you wait till tomorrow When you wake up with me at your side And find I haven't lied about nothing And I wouldn't trade a tree For the way I feel about you in the morning Anyhow, I love you And every day, it gets just a little bit better And half the getting there is knowing where I been before Well, I'm sure you understand 'cause I ain't your first man And when you feel like running for the back door, don't Just you wait until tomorrow When you wake up with me at your side And find I haven't lied about nothing And I wouldn't trade a tree For the way I feel about you in the morning Anyhow, I love youI'd rather sleep in a box Like a bum on the street Than a fine feather bed Without your little old cold feet And I'd rather be deaf Dumb and stone blind Than to know that your mornings Will never be mine And I'd rather die young Than to live without you And I'd rather go hungry Than eat lonesome stew You know it's once in a lifetime And it won't come again It's here and it's gone On a magnolia wind I'd rather not walk Through the garden again If I can't catch your scent On a magnolia windI got an old blue shirt and it suits me just fine I like the way it feels so I wear it all the time I got an old guitar won't ever stay in tune I like the way it sounds in a dark and empty room I got an old pair of boots and they fit just right Well I can work all day and I can dance all night I got an old used car and it runs just like a top I get the feeling it ain't ever gonna stop Stuff that works, stuff that holds up The kind of stuff you don't hang on the wall Stuff that's real, stuff you feel The kind of stuff you reach for when you fall I got a pretty good friend who's seen me at my worst He can't tell if I'm a blessing or a curse But he always shows up when the chips are down That's the kind of stuff I like to be around Stuff that works, stuff that holds up The kind of stuff you don't hang on a wall Stuff that's real, stuff you feel The kind of stuff you reach for when you fallFirst I thought a snake had got me, it happened dreadful quick It was a bullet bit my leg and right off I got sick I came to in a wagon load of ten more wounded men Five was dead by the time we reached that bloody tent Give me some of that Soldier's Joy You know what I mean I don't want to hurt no more My leg is turning green The doctor came and looked at me and this is what he said"Your dancing days are done, son, it's a good thing you ain't dead"Then he went to work with a carving knife, sweat fell from his brow About killed me trying to save my life when he cut that lead ball out Give me some of that Soldier's Joy Ain't you got no more Hand me down my walking cane I ain't cut out for war The red blood run right through my veins, it run all over the floor And it run right down his apron strings like a river out the door He handed me a bottle, said, "Son, drink deep as you can"He turned away and he turned right back with a hacksaw in his hand Give me some of that Soldier's Joy You know what I like Bear down on that fiddle, boys Just like Saturday night Give me some of that Soldier's Joy You know what I crave I'll be hitting that Soldier's Joy Till I'm in my graveShe could dance that slow Uvalde Shuffle to some cowboy hustle How she made them trophy buckles shine, shine, shine Wild-eyed and Mexican silvered Tricking dumb old cousin Willard Into thinking that he got her this time Hill country honky-tonking Rita Ballou Every beer joint in town has played a fool for you Backsliding barrel-riding Rita Ballou Ain't a cowboy in Texas would not ride a bull for you She's a rawhide rope and velvet mixture Walking talking Texas texture High-timing barroom fixture kind of girl She's the queen of the cowboys Look at old Willard grinning now, boys You'd have thought there's less fools in this world Hill country honky-tonking Rita Ballou Every beer joint in town has played the fool for you Backsliding barrel-riding Rita Ballou Ain't a cowboy in Texas would not ride a bull for youI
