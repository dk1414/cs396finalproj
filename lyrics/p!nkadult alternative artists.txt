Right from the start You were a thief, you stole my heart And I, your willing victim I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty And with every touch, you fixed them Now you've been talking in your sleep Oh, oh Things you never say to me Oh, oh Tell me that you've had enough Of our love, our love Just give me a reason Just a little bit's enough Just a second - we're not broken, just bent And we can learn to love again It's in the stars It's been written in the scars on our hearts We're not broken, just bent And we can learn to love again I'm sorry I don't understand Where all of this is coming from I thought that we were fine Your head is running wild again My dear, we still have everything And it's all in your mindLa-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da Da-da-da We are searchlights, we can see in the dark We are rockets, pointed up at the stars We are billions of beautiful hearts And you sold us down the river too far What about us What about all the times you said you had the answers What about us What about all the broken happy ever afters What about us What about all the plans that ended in disaster What about love  What about trust What about us We are problems that want to be solved We are children that need to be loved We were willin', we came when you called But man, you fooled us Enough is enough, ohWhere's all my soul sistas Lemme hear y'all

That's my plan , that's my plan, that's my planEver wonder about what he's doing How it all turned to lies Sometimes I thinkï»¿ that it's better To never ask why Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die You've gotta get up and try, try, try Gotta get up and try, try, try You gotta get up and try, try, try Eh, eh, eh Funny how the heart can be deceiving More than just a couple times Why do we fall in love so easy Even when it's not right Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die You've gotta get up and try, try, try Gotta get up and try, try, try You gotta get up and try, try, tryI know that I am runnin' out of time I want it all, mm-mm And I'm wishin' they'd stop tryin' to turn me off I want it on, mm-mm And I'm walkin' on a wire, tryin' to go higher Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars Even when I give it all away I want it all, mm-mm We came here to run it, run it, run it We came here to run it, run it, run it Just like fire, burnin' up the way If I could light the world up for just one day Watch this madness, colorful charade No one can be just like me any way Just like magic, I'll be flyin' free I'mma disappear when they come for me I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say No one can be just like me anyway Just like fire, uh And people like to laugh at you cause they are all the same, mmm See I would rather we just go a different way than play the game And no matter the weather, we can do it better You and me together, forever and ever We don't have to worry 'bout a thing, 'bout a thingI've been dreaming, friendly faces I've got so much time to kill Just imagine people laughing I know some day we will And even if it's far away Get me through another day Cover me in sunshine Shower me with good times Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning And everything'll be alright Cover me in sunshine From a distance all these mountains Are just some tiny hills Wildflowers, they keep living While they're just standing still I've been missing yesterday But what if there's a better place Cover me in sunshine Shower me with good times Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning And everything'll be alright Cover me in sunshine Shower me with good times Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning And everything'll be alright Cover me in
