Is what you say all true The one you never knew Has come to take himself what it's given you The love of greed of faithful truth Whilst that you won't be Too far of your own degree Is it the way that life has just past your by Taken too much to see while I know you feel I don't look out for the one thing that you never knew So many others have been here looking for something or even a clue Is it you heavy moon Under the heavy moon Another love too soon Nothing to help us fill what's been left behind A man came down to a troubled mind To save the lonely soul It's not just heavy what's gold To look for good and wrong by hollow lies Look for love and lost thatI can see what it is you gave me In my silent moment I can hear all that you have sent me In my silent moment To be one within you To be not without you To be as I once was I can feel the love that I was missing In my silent moment I can be all that I was wishing In my silent moment To be one within you To be not without you To be as I once wasAll the things you thought that you'd never be Not a sinner, not an enemy All the love that you had kept in your heart Was just a love that you had torn apart Is this what you want Can this be what you need You've lived your life so long You've lived your life in fear You sing in tune but you're so out of touch Tell me, what is that you love so much Was it the way you shared with all of your soul Or the freedom of the love you stole Is this what you want Can this be what you need You've lived your life so long You've lived your life in fear I can hear your words as they pass me by I can hear your songs as they're sung in time"To love's to forgive Love the sinner, hate the sin"I can hear these words and make them mineI could never read you Love, you think I’m much too kind Do you ever say how you feel Trying to control it Love is like a spinning wheel Slowing down would only reveal it In the end everything falls apart When you love somebody that’s not in your heart Keeping it together’s the hardest part When you find yourself losing the one that’s not for love I would never have it Would you ever let me go In your heart do you think so I don’t think you feel it Love should be something more In your heart you know it’s just for show In the end everything falls apart When you love somebody that’s not in your heart Keeping it together’s the hardest part When you find yourself losing the one that’s not for loveHow long have you been gone My Love, why are you so withdrawn Alone am I can't you see Do I need a sign to beg you please Come let's go and leave this land To far-off shores without a sound Shout out and say what you mean Come out from this reality I know your heart is back home In time, together we shall roam Across the sea, to far-off lands Together we'll be Just like we planned I know that the sun lies eastward I know where my heart belongs Back home where my love lies waiting Back home where we are one Day dawns and I'm still here Too far to reach and to see clearI'm looking for the one that's with me The one that burns an eternal light A distant sun that's deep within me A force too strong to ever fight A setting sun is not an ending A setting sun can be our light to get us right I've taken all that's handed to me So much detail, so little insight A calling card for the end of our century A new rebirth to give new life A setting sun is not an ending A setting sun can be our light to get us right I know it's hard to know When it's time to go Feel it coming near Hear your heart beat clear A light will guide our way To the life we've paid All we've done today Will carry us awayLand of dead, land of endless space Land of fire, the sky burns brighter Empty love, empty space Are we all losing grace We can live here no more Serpent skin, you’ve shed again Stories grow but the truth will show What’s the use of hiding here Can you smell the stench of fear Your eyes do not lie“Goodbye, blue sky So long, clean air Do you even care ”All these words seem to cut right through Sometimes silence can say so much In my heart I know I'm all for you Can you show me what is true In my heart I know I’m all for you Can you show me what is true All these words seem to cut right through Sometimes silence can say so much In my heart I know I'm all for you Can you show me what is true In my heart I know I'm all for you Can you show me what is true In my heart I know I’m all for you Can you show me what is true In my heart I know I'm all for you Can you show me what is true In my heart I know I'm all for you Can you show me what is true In my heart I know I'm all for you Can you show me what is true Is what you say all true The one you never knew Has come to take himself what it's given you The love of greed of faithful truth Whilst that you won't be Too far of your own degree Is it the way that life has just past your by Taken too much to see while I know you feel I don't look out for the one thing that you
