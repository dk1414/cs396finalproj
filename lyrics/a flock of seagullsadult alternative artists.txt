I walked along the avenue I never thought I'd meet a girl like you Meet a girl like you With auburn hair and tawny eyes The kind of eyes that hypnotise me through Hypnotise me through And I ran, I ran so far away I just ran, I ran all night and day I couldn't get away A cloud appears above your head A beam of light comes shining down on you Shining down on you The cloud is moving nearer still Aurora borealis comes in view Aurora comes in view And I ran, I ran so far away I just ran, I ran all night and day I couldn't get awayI saw your eyes And you made me smile And for a little while I was falling in love I saw your eyes And you touched my mind And though it took a while I was falling in love I was falling in love I saw your eyes And you made me cry And for a little while I was falling in love I was falling in loveIt's not the way you look, it's not the way that you smile Although there's something to them It's not the way you have your hair, it's not that certain style It could be that perfume If I had a photograph of you Or something to remind me I wouldn't spend my life just wishing It's not the makeup and it's not the way that you dance It's not the evening sky It's more the way your eyes are laughing as they glance Across the great divide If I had a photograph of you Or something to remind me I wouldn't spend my life just wishing It's not the things you say, it's not the things you do It must be something more And if I feel this way for so long, tell me is it all for nothing You'll still walk out the doorNo, never give your heart to a stranger Don't tell your secrets to a friend Don't put your heart in mortal danger They all desert you in the end The more you live, the more you love Or so they say The more you love, the more you're growing They say that nothing lasts forever And even true love turns to pain Don't trust your feelings to a stranger Don't wanna go through this again The more you live, the more you love Or so they say The more you love, the more you're growing The more you live, the more you love Or so they say The more you love, the more you're growing Don't ever give your heart to a stranger Don't ever think that you can hold on Don't put your heart in mortal danger You turn around and love has goneI walk along the avenue I never thought I'd meet a girl like you Meet a girl like you With auburn hair and tawny eyes The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through You hypnotize me through And I ran, I ran so far away I just ran, I ran all night and day I couldn't get away A cloud appears above your head A beam of light comes shining down on you Shining down on you The cloud is moving nearer still Aurora Borealis comes in view Aurora comes in view And I ran, I ran so far away I just ran, I ran all night and day I couldn't get awayYou're giving me a hard time What am I supposed to do, with a hard time Especially from you The way that you smile Reveals a shadow from the past When I thought I knew you But you lied If I see you walking If I see you talking What am I supposed to do What am I supposed to do What am I supposed to do What am I supposed to do You say it's over this time Emotion in the past Remember last time You said it wouldn't last The look in your eyes Another shadow from the past When I thought I knew you Don't know whyShe's an automatic He's a cosmic man They will get together They should know
