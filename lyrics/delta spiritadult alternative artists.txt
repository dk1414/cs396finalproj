So cold I know you can’t believe it Sometimes you gotta face the feelin’When you don’t care if you get up again There’s a thousand things I will not understand How you're dealin’ with the hell I put you through If I had my way I would be right there next to you Certain things in life you cannot change Certain things I hope you know I care I’ve been alone too many nights Too proud to tell you when you’re right A little patience would’ve helped me then Locked like a brake has been the common standard All the angels 'bove the Earth I beg Set this message right into her head Certain things in life I cannot take When I’m away I hope you know I care I hope you know I care I hope you know I care So cold I know you can’t believe it Sometimes you gotta face the feelin’When you don’t care if you get up again There’s a thousand things I will not understand How you're dealin’ with the hell I put you through If I had my way I would be right there next to you Certain things in life you cannot change Certain things I hope you know I careI want to disappear Far from the folks I know I want to get an answer To why I was even born No one here can tell me What's been haunting me all my life Well, this rat race has left me limping'Cause I balanced on the edge of the knife Why am I here Oh, what should I do Well, is this the point I'm trying to prove If there's a God in my head Then there's a devil too How can I tell the difference When they both claim to be true Maybe God is God Maybe the Devil is me Well, I just throw my chains on And tell myself that I'm free Chains, are they really there Is this just in my head Well, I'll just stay in bedToo much talk 'bout myself Drags me straight into hell Finally hearing from you Pulls me back off the rail You don't expect apologies You always see the best in me I'm the lucky fool that you married It always starts out as friends You always had my respect They all warned you 'bout me Don't give your heart to a wreck And when we're out on the run Drive into the setting sun My heart beats for only you My heart beats for only you My heart beats for only you My heart beats for only you My heart beats for only you My heart beats for only you My heart beats for only youIn the German sky there once was a plane It carried 71 children and their mothers to Spain Well, this plane was sure somethin'It was full of young Russians Proudly to gander at topics discussin'Now Pete the Swiss was doublin' shifts Jugglin' the iron controlled by his lips Not a minute too soon children fell to their doom Struck dead in the air, orphan a father or two He just laid in the alley Now orphan Vitaly met a young girl, married her quickly Was so damn in love that they had their two kids Had a great job, construction in Spain They were goin' to see Papa from Caucasus mountain range Now that damn Swissman crashed them into a plane I will find where he lives, speak to his face With the blood in my eyes, he will see my pain Many weeks passed, for fear of a suit The airline said nothin', Vitaly turned blue For the killin' they done, no apology made Is it 'cause we are Russian you treat us this way Could you feel me melting in your hand The last time you saw me, I was blacked out in the van Disregarding every single red light that I saw I blew past a speed trap, now I'm in trouble with the law For the longest time I would try To get in line But it ain't easy And I found it hard To be myself Without your help But it ain't easy, easy, easy In your suit, you're dancing on my stage Sipping pink lemonade, I'm rolling in my grave Thought I was dead, but I am better now Proving those in doubt I'll never let you down For the longest time I would try To get in line But it ain't easy And I found it hard To be myself Without your help But it ain't easyI'm a wandering soul I got no place of my own Well, I got nothing to give Well, I got nothing to show for it And I'll be wandering on for all my years What I become, no one could know If you're feeling what I'm feeling c'mon All you soul searching people c'mon And I got something to say, my friends I will never lay down without a fight And when I die, it will be the day When every one of my wrongs will be made right Only time's gonna heal my pain Lord knows the mistakes I will make Yeah, there'll be peace in my soul someday Reconciled, I'll be on my way And I'll be wandering on for all my years What I become, no one can say If you're feeling what I'm feeling c'mon All you soul searching people c'mon Oh no, if you're feeling what I'm feeling c'mon All you soul searching people c'mon, ohDown in Reseda where I left my keys You picked them up and stepped right in I had a vision about this very thing But it's probably in my head From now on, from now on From now on I'm gonna be your friend Your inner compass says you know I'm right No more letters, just a will All the prophets on the mountaintop But no one's hanging on the hill From now on, from now on From now on I'm gonna be your friend From now on, from now on From now on I'm gonna be your friend Something put you in my way May the moment awake in your head Fall in to the what is Let your body do all the rest May a love never break you May a love never break you Keep your heart on your sleeve real close Don't let anyone else tell you differentThe sun fell, another night began Shots rang out, all the people ran Confident in our innocence Promises out in the wilderness I know I said I would I know I said I would The martyred sons of a forgotten fit Bend a knee for your favorite So foolish in their innocence Promises out in the wilderness I know I said I would I know I said I would Hold my end, hold my end up, hold my end Hold my end, hold my end up, hold my end It's not too late to turn your back on them What kind of friend would lead you to your death As the chill finally hit your skin Your accomplice turned you in Juliet, you had your reasons Migraine hallucinations Had no way to define The start and the stop of your Freudian mind I believed you when you said God told you what to do But the God inside your head was wrong Fell in to a passionate clique Only way to truth is isolation Patriarch, patriarch, tell me what to do Patriarch, I must follow through Oh, the light shaking on the floor Speaking tongues of angels Surely I must be in the right Oh, this tempest loves to fight Blood bath on the John Muir trail And the hiker recalled the tale Juliet and her friend stood at the edge Juliet jumped without restraint Her friend fell back, lost faith Without a God to blameBrothers hold the line till we got something This world is way too small to feel like nothing I was found near the train tracks looking so homeless at you You came like a copper, you said, "Son, it's time to move"My love is coming I can barely, hardly wait around When my mother left the bat was the only one here He is just a reason why I'm still here My mother's well spoken, no I didn't get that gene But yes, I lost it, and yes, my eyes they are green My love is coming I can barely, hardly wait around Well if you hide your questions there's no answer I finally found the cure for my own cancer, yeah My love is coming I can barely, hardly wait My heart is thumping, I can feel it more with every beat My love is coming I can barely, hardly wait around
