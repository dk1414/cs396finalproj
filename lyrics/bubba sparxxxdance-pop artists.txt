I giggle outside the booth; but ain't no joke inside This is complicated - at least to y'all it is Just let me sell fifty million, then I'll call it quits But until that day, y'all in deep doo doo I never once saw you crank it cause I just leap through you What you need to do, is just admit you love me The South has always been Dirty but now it's gettin' uglyI've been travelin' for some time With my fishin' pole and my bottle of shine On these long dark dusty roads Lookin' there's nowhere to go I guess I gotta hide away, far away'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way I gotta hide away, far away'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way Ayy-ayy-ayy ayy-ayy-ayy ayy I left out from mamma's with my thumb in the wind The leaves on the ground, winter's comin again Solid on the surface as I crumble within But legends are made out of vulnerable men So on the brink of death, I still manage livin' life'Cause so rarely in this world are these chances given twice I indeed sold my soul, without glancing at the price No instructions when I was handed this device But with what I did get, I was more than generous Put others over self on several instances But I'm back on my feet without a hint of bitterness And one way or another I shall have deliverance So I say:My shits the most important shit In the whole world, it's mine of course it is The more I ponder it, the more it gets More and more important til' i done distorted it Out of proportion, loss of coordinates Help me Lord, 'fore I fall and scorch in it Orbiting, around the pulpit Gravity pulls to bullshit, what if What if  Grandma had balls She'd been Grandpa, might of ran off With the neighbor lady Mammary Mable That was a label since back in grade school Short story long, do it wrong And being done wrong Happens,
