To Everything There is a season And a time to every purpose, under Heaven A time to be born, a time to die A time to plant, a time to reap A time to kill, a time to heal A time to laugh, a time to weep To Everything There is a season And a time to every purpose, under Heaven A time to build up, a time to break down A time to dance, a time to mourn A time to cast away stones A time to gather stones together To Everything There is a season And a time to every purpose, under HeavenHey, Mr  Tambourine Man, play a song for me I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm goin' to Hey, Mr  Tambourine Man, play a song for me In the jingle jangle morning, I'll come followin' you Take me for a trip upon your magic swirling ship All my senses have been stripped And my hands can't feel to grip And my toes too numb to step Wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin'I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade Unto my own parade Cast your dancing spell my way I promise to go under it Hey, Mr  Tambourine Man, play a song for me I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm goin' to Hey, Mr  Tambourine Man, play a song for me In the jingle jangle morning, I'll come followin' youOh, I'd rather go and journey Where the diamond crescent's glowing And run across the valley Beneath the sacred mountain And wander through the forest Where the trees have leaves of prisms And break the light in colors That no one knows the names of And when it's time I'll go and wait Beside a legendary fountain'Til I see your form reflected In its clear and jeweled waters And if you think I'm ready You may lead me to the chasm Where the rivers of our vision Flow into one anotherI think I'm goin' back To the things I learned so well in my youth I think I'm returning to Those days when I was young enough to know the truth Now there are no games To only pass the time No more electric trains No more trees to climb But thinking young and growing older is no sin And I can play the game of life to win I can recall a time When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend Now I think I've got A lot more than just my toys to lend Now there's more to do Than watch my sailboat glide But every day can be A magic carpet ride A little bit of courage is all we lack So catch me if you can, I'm goin' backEight miles high, and when you touch down You'll find that it's stranger than known Signs in the street, that say where you're going Are somewhere just being their own Nowhere is there warmth to be found Among those afraid of losing their ground Rain gray town, known for its sound In places, small faces unbound Round the squares, huddled in storms Some laughing, some just shapeless forms Sidewalk scenes, and black limousines Some living, some standing aloneOh how is it that I could come out to here And be still floating And never hit bottom and keep falling through Just relaxed and paying attention All my two dimensional boundaries were gone I had lost to them badly I saw the world crumble and thought I was dead But I found my senses still working And as I continued to drop through the hole I found all the surrounding To show me the joy that innocently is Just be quiet and feel it around you And I opened my heart to the whole universe And I found it was loving And I saw the great blunder my teachers had made Scientific delirium madness I will keep falling as long as I live All without ending And I will remember the place that is now That has ended before the beginning Oh how is it that I could come out to here And be still floating And never hit bottom and keep falling through Just relaxed and paying attentionSun warm on my face, I hear you Down below moving slow And it's morning Take my time this morning, no hurry To learn to kill and take the will From unknown faces Today was the day for action Leave my bed to kill instead Why should it happen The reasons why, oh, I can't say I have to let you go, babe, and right away After what you did, I can't stay on And I'll probably feel a whole lot better When you're gone Baby, for a long time, you had me believe That your love was all mine, and that's the way it would be But I didn't know, that you were putting me on And I'll probably feel a whole lot better When you're gone Oh, when you're gone Now I've got to say that it's not like before And I'm not gonna play your games anymore After what you did, I can't stay on And I'll probably feel a whole lot better When you're gone Oh, when you're gone Oh, when you're gone Oh, when you're goneThe jukebox is playin' a honky-tonk song"One more", I keep sayin', "and then I'll go home"What good will it do me, I know what I'll find An empty bottle, a broken heart and you're still on my mind The people are dancin' and havin' their fun And I sit here thinkin' about what you have done To try and forget you, I've turned to the wine An empty bottle, a broken heart and you're still on my mind Alone and forsaken, so blue I could cry I just sit here drinkin' till the bottle runs dry What good will it do me, I know what I'll find An empty bottle, a broken heart and you're still on my mind An empty bottle, a broken heart and you're still on my mindYou want to know how it will be Me and her, or you and me You both stand there, your long hair flowing Your eyes alive, your mind still growing Saying to me what can we do now that we both love you I love you too And I don't really see Why can't we go on as three You are afraid, embarrassed too No one has ever said such a thing to you Your mother's ghost stands at your shoulders A face like ice, a little bit colder Saying to you, you cannot do that It breaks all the rules, you learned in school But I don't really see Why can't we go on as three We love each other, it's plain to see There's just one answer that comes to be Sister lovers, water brothers, and in time maybe others So you see what we can do is to try something new If you're crazy too And I don't really see Why can't we go on as three
