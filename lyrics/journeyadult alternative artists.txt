Just a small-town girl, livin' in a lonely world She took the midnight train goin' anywhere Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit He took the midnight train goin' anywhere A singer in a smoky room The smell of wine and cheap perfume For a smile, they can share the night It goes on and on and on and on Strangers waitin'Up and down the boulevard Their shadows searchin' in the night Streetlights, people Livin' just to find emotion Hidin' somewhere in the night Workin' hard to get my fill Everybody wants a thrill Payin' anything to roll the dice Just one more timeHighway run into the midnight sun Wheels go 'round and 'round, you're on my mind Restless hearts, sleep alone tonight Sendin' all my love along the wire They say that the road ain't no place to start a family Right down the line, it's been you and me And lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be Oh, girl, you stand by me I'm forever yours Faithfully Circus life under the big-top world We all need the clowns to make us smile Through space and time, always another show Wonderin' where I am lost without you And bein' apart ain't easy on this love affair Two strangers learn to fall in love again I get the joy of rediscovering you Oh, girl, you stand by meHere we stand Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two Sleepless nights Losing ground, I'm reaching for you, you, you Feeling that it's gone Can't change your mind If we can't go on To survive the tide Love divides Someday love will find you Break those chains that bind you One night will remind you How we touched and went our separate ways If he ever hurts you True love won't desert you You know I still love you Though we touched and went our separate ways Troubled times Caught between confusion and pain, pain, pain Distant eyes Promises we made were in vain, in vain, in vainLying beside you Here in the dark Feeling your heartbeat with mine Softly you whisper You're so sincere How could our love be so blind We sailed on together We drifted apart And here you are By my side So now I come to you With open arms Nothing to hide Believe what I say So here I am With open arms Hoping you'll see What your love means to me Open arms Living without you Living alone This empty house seems so cold Wanting to hold you Wanting you near How much I wanted you homeWinter is here again, oh lord Haven't been home in a year or more I hope she holds on a little longer Sent a letter on a long summer day Made of silver, not of clay Ooh, I've been runnin' down this dusty road Ooh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'I don't know where I'll be tomorrow Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'I've been trying to make it home Got to make it before too long Ooh, I can't take this very much longer, no I'm standing in the sleet and rain Don't think I'm ever gonna make it home again The morning sun is risin', it's kissin' the day Ooh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'I don't know where I'll be tomorrow Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'Whoa, whoa, whoa My, my, my, my, my For tomorrowWhen the lights go down in the City And the sun shines on the bay Ooh, I wanna be there in my City, oh Oh, oh, oh So you think you're lonely Well, my friend, I'm lonely too I want to get back to my City by the bay Oh, oh, oh It's sad, oh, there's been mornings out on the road without you Without your charms Ooh, my, my, my, my, my, my Oh, oh, oh When the lights go down in the City And the sun shines on the bay Ooh, I wanna be there in my City, oh Oh, oh, oh When the lights go down in the City And the sun shines on the bay Ooh, I wanna be there in my City, oh Oh, oh, oh Mmm Oh, oh, ohIt's been a mystery And still they try to see Why something good can hurt so bad Caught on a one-way street The taste of bittersweet Love will survive somehow, some way One love feeds the fire One heart burns desire I wonder, who's crying now Two hearts born to run Who'll be the lonely one I wonder who's crying now So many stormy nights So many wrongs or rights Neither could change Their headstrong ways And in a lover's rage They tore another page The fighting is worth The love they saveAny way you want it That's the way you need it Any way you want it She loves to laugh She loves to sing She does everything She loves to move She loves to groove She loves the loving things Ooh, all night All night Oh, every night So hold tight Hold tight Ooh, baby, hold tight Oh, she said Any way you want it That's the way you need it Any way you want it She said, Any way you want it That's the way you need it Any way you want itYou make me weep, and wanna die Just when you said we'd try Loving, touching, squeezing each other When I'm alone all by myself You're out with someone else Loving, touching, squeezing each other You're tearing me apart Every, every day You're tearing me apart Oh, what can I say You're tearing me apart It won't be long, yes, 'til you're alone When your lover, oh, he hasn't come home'Cause he's loving, ooh, he's touching He's squeezing another He's tearing you apart Ooh, every, every day He's tearing you apart Oh, girl, what can you say Cause he's loving, touching anotherJust a small-town girl, livin' in
