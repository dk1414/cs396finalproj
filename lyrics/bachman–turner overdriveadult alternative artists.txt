I met a devil woman She took my heart away She said, I've had it comin' to me But I wanted it that way I think that any love is good lovin'So I took what I could get Mmh, mmh, mmh She looked at me with big brown eyes And said You ain't seen nothin' yet B-b-b-baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet Here's something that you're never gonna forget B-b-b-baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet Nothin' yet, you ain't been around That's what she told me And now I'm feelin' better'Cause I found out for sure She took me to her doctor And he told me of a cureYou get up every morning from alarm clock's warning Take the 8:15 into the city There's a whistle up above and people pushing, people shoving And the girls who try to look pretty And if your train's on time, you can get to work by nine And start your slavin' jobs and get your pay If you ever get annoyed, look at me, I'm self-employed I love to work at nothing all day And I've been takin' care of business, every day Takin' care of business, every way I've been takin' care of business, it's all mine Takin' care of business and working overtime, work out Whoo If it were easy as fishing, you could be a musician If you could make sounds loud or mellow Get a secondhand guitar, chances are you'll go far If you get in with the right bunch of fellows People see you having fun just a-lying in the sun You tell them that you like it this way It's the work that we avoid and we're all self-employed We love to work at nothing all day{Intro}Goodbye, hard life Don't cry, would you let it ride Goodbye, hard life Don't cry, would you let it ride {hook}You can see the mornin', but I can see the light Try, try, try, let it ride While you've been out runnin', I've been waitin' half the night Try, try, try, let it ride And would you cry if I told you that I lied And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride And would you cry if I told you that I lied And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride Seems my life is not complete, I never see you smile Try, try, try, let it ride Baby you want the forgivin' kind, and that's just not my style Try, try, try, let it ride And would you cry if I told you that I lied And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride And would you cry if I told you that I lied And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride Hey you!You say you wanna change the world It's alright With me  There's no regret It's my turn!The circle game has brought me here And I won't let down 'till every song is set You realize now!You should have tried now, oh!The music's gone now!You lost it, somehow Hey you!Sha la la la Hey you!Sha la la la Woo!Sha la la Woo!Sha la la Hey you!You say the race is much too fast It's okay With me  I'm keeping pace It's my game!The music is inside my head For every one on top there's one who can't retraceWe rented a truck and a semi to go Travel down the long and winding road Look on the map I think we've been here before Close all the doors let's roll once more Cop on the corner, look he's startin' to write I don't need no ticket so I screamed out of sight Drove so fast that my eyes can't see Look in the mirror is he still followin' me Let it roll down the highway Let it roll down the highway Roll, roll Look at the sign, we're in the wrong place Move out boys, let's get ready to race454 coming over the hill The man on patrol, is gonna give us a bill The time's real short, you know the distance is long I'd rather have a jet but it's not in the song Climb back in the cab, cross your fingers for luck We gotta keep movin' if we're gonna make a buck Let it roll down the highway Let it roll down the highway RollComin' to you across country Hoping boogies still allowed You ask do we play heavy music Well are thunderheads just another cloud We do Not Fragile, straight at you Then we vanish to the night Still in your ears but out of sight Not Fragile Don't think we feel hurt or wounded Or our egos are showing thru It's our world that's been disrupted And our strength reflects from you Well it's true Not Fragile, over you Try us when you're getting down Feelin' high or just hangin' round Not Fragile The times we travel in our lives Are hard and fast and give us drive We may seem distant most of the time But many thoughts are still on our minds Not FragileI was walking on down the alley When a face I've never seen Came so from deep in the darkness And his mouth came on real mean And I saw that he'd been liquored And he staggered up to -- you know -- he staggered up to his feet And he said, "Boy, you'd better move real slow And gimme your money please."He said, "Gimme your money please."Wasn't that strange Wasn't that strange indeed Wasn't that strange Wasn't that strange indeed He said, "Gimme your money please."He said, "Gimme your money please."Being born and raised in New York There ain't nothing you won't see'Cause the streets are filled with bad goings-on And you know that's no place to be But my car broke down in the evening You know it just stopped stone cold Stopped stone cold in the street And a dirty mean man with sharp glass eyes He said, "Gimme your money please."He said, "Gimme your money please."Walk your street And I'll walk mine And should we meet Would you spare me some time Cuz you should see my world Meet my kind, and before you judge our minds Blue collar Sleep your sleep I'm awake and alive I keep late hours You're a nine to five So I would like you to know I need the quiet hours to create in this world of mine Blue collar I'd like you to know at four in the morning, things are comin' to mind All I see, all I've done, and those I hope to find I'd like to remind you at four in the morning my world is very still The air is fresh under diamond skies, makes me glad to be alive You keep that beat And I keep time Your restless face Is no longer mine I rest my feet while the world's in heat and I wish that you could do the same Blue collarHeaded 'cross the border Looking for a place to play I left the sun behind I don't mind But I think that it looked like rain Hold back the water I gotta find time to burn Hold back the water I gotta find time to burn Headed west to Georgia Looking for the road to L.A They say the weather's fine But the sun don't shine'Cause the smog's always in the way Hold back the water I gotta find time to burn Hold back the water I gotta find time to burn I've never played no smoker You know I've never played no hotdog The preacher say I was born this way With a storm cloud in my heartIt's a hurried up life But it's the life I choose No use in asking me to slow down Cause I got nothing to lose But time and time is all I've got You know I was born standing up with a guitar in my hand I'm not trying to come on like Hollywood But Hollywood is what I am When we come into a new town Everybody's there When we play our music Hands are in the air When the music's over You wonder where we are I'm standing in the silence With my old guitar Rock is my life and this is my song It's a crying shame That some of us have not survived No use in asking how it happened But very few are left alive
