And you will know us by the trail of dead Close the door and drift away Into a sea of uncertainty Where all your hopes And dreams have faded out of reach Remember all the bad dreams Not far from reality Would you write again for me And you awake and there you are Not far off from the line before And just how long it take for you to understand Where your feelings stopped and writing began Convince yourself to take control Play to the hilt this unlikely role Remember all the bad dreams Are not far from reality Would you write again for me Looking back in time Through verses set in nursery rhyme At oil painted eyes Of muses left behind I swear I know not why Those eyes have always left me dry She stands with arms stretched out Towards the mountains and the clouds Oil painted eyes Blind yet hypnotized I swear I know not why Those eyes have always left me dry Me dry How near, how far, how lost they are How near, how far, how lost they are How near, how far, how lost they are How near, how far, how lost they are How near, how far, how lost they are How near, how far I've rendered every line Every contour of a muse's eye Painted in my mind On canvases of time I swear I know not why Those eyes have always left me dry Me dry Me dryIf I could make a list Of my mistakes and regrets I'd put your name on top And every line after it'Cause every inch of hope Becomes a world of shame I've had to walk through Each and every day And if I screamed "you were wrong"At the top of my lungs You would never return All the faith that I've lost And there is nothing left to say That has not been said If I shouted, you wouldn't listen I don't think it'd even sink in If I could make a list Of my mistakes and regrets I'd put your name on top And every line after itOn the plane you arrive You caught me on the ground Promise don't look down I have a picture of us I want you to smile Now I don't know why Ah, do you recall The nights we raced around The nights we owned this town I have another set of eyes That I used to disguise the part of me that died I have another set of lives That I used to describe the part that's still alive I try to picture you now Were we ever more than friends If so, I don't know when The part of me you don't know anymore Each time I try to recollect the people we were then Ah, do you recall That night that made us cry And now I don't know whyNow that our ties are severed As we wave goodbye Let us not wonder whether We are ready to take the dive Let it dive, let it die, let it fade out of sight Let it drag us down, let it fade Grieve, but not grieve together Mourn with nothing to say Gone are those times forever Lost are those sweet warm other days Let it dive, let it die, let it fade out of sight Let it drag us down, let it come between you and I Let it dive, let it die, let it fade Were we born to despair Deeds done but not forgiven There will always be something there As long as one of us goes on living Let it dive, let it die Let it fade out of sight Let it drag us down, let it come between you and I What is done is done, no reason to apologize Let it dive, let it die, let it fadeI have made you in my likeness And I will make you the keeper of my garden world If you honor me in kind, I'll be grateful, but be warned I'm a jealous God Who placed the demons in hell And the angels in heaven At my side So set me free, I'll grant your hearts desire And I will share the secrets of the grand design Give me daughters, send me sons and I'll make them all chosen ones I will send them out to die To meet the angels of death With no tears, no regrets I was cast down from the heights My blood must pay for the debt That was made when they left Because of me And if they taste the blood we'll let them drink And if they taste the flesh we'll let them eat And if one has to be forgiven then we'll pardon all of them And if they raze our walls we'll let them in And if they raise their swords we'll let them hit And if one has to be forgiven then We'll pardon all of them Let me lead you to the garden world I will place you at the right of my father's hand I was tempted in the wild I crossed from start till end of time I emerged the sacred lamb Whose blood must pay for the debt That was made when they left As I ascend into the sky I'll free the angels from hell And place them in heaven At my sideThe only sin in this world of pain In this world of shame In this world of heartache The only sin in this world unjust In this world of lust In this world distrusting The only sin in this world corrupt Where passions erupt And end abrupt it's a crime With no great gestures cry Its eyes, with no great evils shine Here among all the vicious beasts With their blood lust feast Ordained by black priests Here among the poison viper's bite A police gunfight In the unknown night is a man With no great master plan No deadly weapon clutching in his hand You'll never see the light In the darkest night Never see the light Never see the light When the boredom comesIt's hard to imagine, it's so hard to perceive To find an expression for what it all means All panic and struggle, all death and decay Are coming together in relative ways This electric guitar hanging to my knees Got a couple of verses I can barely breathe But it's all right, it's O KIt's coming together in relative ways It's O K, I'm a saint I forgave your mistakes It's O K, I'm a saint I forgave your mistakes And It started to happen, and it'started to change With the movement up on us, hope we make it O KIf it takes a life or a couple of days Coming together in relative ways An electric guitar hangs to my knees Got a couple of verses I can barely breathe It's all right, it's O KIt's coming together in relative waysAre you asleep, are you in a dream The copper shades of a morning Distant lights beckon and fade Unwritten songs of another day I fear that you would never be Every song in the world for me I took your hand, led you astray You cursed the worlds I longed to save To save To save Is heaven to you a perfect place The look of sorrow on a sufferer's face A field of lives to sow and reap That some of us will never see Why is it I don't feel the same Are my longings to be blamed For not seeing heaven like you would see Why is a song a world for me For me For me What is forgiveness It's just a dream What is forgiveness It's everything What is forgiveness It's just a dream What is forgiveness It's everything What is forgiveness It's just a dream What is forgiveness It's everything What is forgiveness It's just a dream What is forgiveness It's everythingIt was there that I saw you And it was there that I came As evening sighs Rises up against the sky-line Let me come and have my leis You were fair and fey as a sun that evil day We were bold and life was great But as time went on I wondered what went wrong I wondered what became Of you Let me hold you in my arms dear And let me melt in the heat of your gaze And let the clock strike one Time and mind go marching on Let our sense of selves decay It was there that I saw you In the heat of a summer's embrace But as time went on I wondered what went wrong I wondered what became Became Became Became, became Of you
