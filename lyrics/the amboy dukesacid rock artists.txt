Leave your cares behind Come with us and find The pleasures of a journey to the center of the mind Come along if you care Come along if you dare Take a ride to the land inside of your mind Beyond the seas of thought Beyond the realm of what Across the streams of hopes and dreams where things are really not Come along if you care Come along if you dare Take a ride to the land inside of your mind But please realize You'll probably be surprised For it's the land unknown to man Where fantasy is fact So if you can, please understand You might not come backBaby, please don't go Baby, please don't

on our way Talk to me, girl Tell me what you know You give me all my soul This is what I say Get a little closer, child Say it in my ear It puts my mind in gear Let me hear you sing Give me some action now Some like I've never seen You make it plain to me Come on and do your thing Look what you've done You've paved my way of life I know that it must be right And we're on our wayNow my journey is ended And I'm back where I began For I've seen things beyond you wildest dreams And I've searched the soul of man Though I die unknown and unrecognized I'm glad I found the time To take the journey To the center To the center Of my mindAren't all the ivory castles Worth all of the hassles One incurs when he blows his mind Aren't all the rainbow colors Worth all the rain Aren't the fine sensations Worth all the pain If life seems to be a drag Keep your spirits high And try to quit relying On the outside world To bring you joy You can't command them To want anything but wealth Don't try and understand them'Till you understand yourself No greed and hatred rule today I feel it right now Going up and coming down Colors all aroundWe keep on thinking it’s all worth while Just like everyone It’s another life, and I’m feeling alright Oh, I’m a son of a gun You know we’re gonna be here all night Give you what you all come for And it’s all worth while just to see you smile Lord I know is all I can say Ain’t it the truth Ain’t it the truth Now I’ve been told that I’m growing old And that don’t mean a thing I just laugh in their face and I keep up the pace Cause I’ve got a song to sing You know we’re gonna be here all night Give you what you all come for And it’s all worth while just to see you smile Lord I know is all I can say Ain’t it the truth Ain’t it the truthI'm lookin' for a way Gotta be the way I should I've been just thinkin' of myself Tryin' to make it anyway I could But 'til I see you again Don't think I'll miss you But then I know I'll see you back again It's just gonna happen And we won't have to worry no more I can wait a little'Cause it's gotta be easy There is none righteous, no, not one There is none that understandeth They are all gone out of the way Their throat is an open sepulchre With their tongues they have used deceit The poison of asps is under their lips Whosе mouth is full of cursing and bitterness Their feet arе swift to shed blood Destruction and misery are in their ways And the way of peace they have not known Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth and been wanton Ye have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter Mine eyes have seen the glory of the lord Mmm, mmm, mmmThere's enough for everyone 'specially you and I Keep a watch on everything, there's more than meets the eye Get yer guns everyone its time to take over this place Get yer guns everyone take 1st prize in the human raceYou surrender to your king Accepting all his worldly things'Til you find out too late, he's used you for bait The bluebird continues to sing, oh ho As a child you searched to find Someone to stand behind But the harder you look, the bigger the crook Tries to overpower your mind, oh ho I know why My self is hard to see I'm sure there's more around Who feel the same as me Now never turn your back On a friend who gave you love If the time came on a cliff He'd be the first to shove You surrеnder to your kings Accepting all his worldly things'Til you find out too late, hе's used you for bait The bluebird continues to sing, oh ho With tears in your eyes You cry in sorrow Don't wanna go, I know You'll die tomorrowI don't know why I feel this way I haven't bought a thing but I'll have to pay No ones gonna let me have my say And you see what you’re doing to me Tonight I'll prove I'm right While collar man working nine to five Blue collar man working to survive I'm glad I haven't got the time It seems it started but where will it end I'm too rich to borrow and to poor to lend I have acquaintances but no ones my friend
