clenches And make the radiator blow now Crack the planks and shatter the lenses And mix the salt, the sugar and flour Sweet and plain, unsingable name That rings in my mind now That strums me like a string Shine, unsingable name Over everything Slushing, sleeting through the blue gloom Some long bells lonely ring Chime, unsingable name Over everything
