Hey, dad, look at me Think back and talk to me Did I grow up according to plan And do you think I'm wasting my time Doing things I wanna do But it hurts when you disapprove all along And now I try hard to make it I just wanna make you proud I'm never gonna be good enough for you Can't pretend that I'm alright And you can't change me'Cause we lost it all Nothing lasts forever I'm sorry I can't be perfect Now it's just too late And we can't go back I'm sorry I can't be perfect I try not to think About the pain I feel inside Did you know you used to be my hero All the days you spent with me Now seem so far away And it feels like you don't care anymoreI woke up, it was seven, I waited 'til eleven Just to figure out that no one would call I think I've got a lot of friends, but I don't hear from them What's another night all alone When you're spending everyday on your own And here it goes I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is Having more fun than me Tonight And maybe when the night is dead, I'll crawl into my bed I'm staring at these four walls again I'll try to think about the last time I had a good time Everyone's got somewhere to go And they're gonna leave me here on my own And here it goes I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is Having more fun than meWhoa, oh, oh Whoa, oh, oh So jet-lagged What time is it where you are I miss you more than anything And back at home you feel so far Waiting for the phone to ring It's getting lonely living upside down I don't even wanna be in this town Tryna figure out the time zone's making me crazy You say good morning when it's midnight Going out of my head, alone in this bed I wake up to your sunset, and it's driving me mad I miss you so bad, and my heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged Heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged Heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged, is so jet-lagged What time is it where you are Five more days and I'll be home I keep your picture in my car I hate the thought of you alone I've been keeping busy all the time Just to try to keep you off my mind Tryna figure out the time zone's making me crazyDo you ever feel like breakin' down Do you ever feel out of place Like somehow you just don't belong And no one understands you Do you ever wanna run away Do you lock yourself in your room With the radio on turned up so loud That no one hears your screamin'?No, you don't know what it's like When nothin' feels alright You don't know what it's like To be like me To be hurt, to feel lost To be left out in the dark To be kicked when you're down To feel like you've been pushed around To be on the edge of breakin' down And no one's there to save you No, you don't know what it's like Welcome to my lifeI open my eyes I try to see, but I’m blinded by the white light I can’t remember how, I can’t remember why I’m lying here tonight And I can’t stand the pain And I can’t make it go away No, I can’t stand the pain How could this happen to me I've made my mistakes Got nowhere to run The night goes on as I’m fading away I’m sick of this life I just wanna scream How could this happen to me Everybody’s screaming I try to make a sound, but no one hears me I’m slipping off the edge, I’m hanging by a thread I wanna start this over again So I try to hold on to a time when nothing mattered And I can’t explain what happened And I can’t erase the things that I've done No, I can’tOh, oh Take me back, take me back Oh, yeah Back to summer paradise My heart is sinking As I'm lifting up Up above the clouds away from you And I can't believe I'm leaving Oh, I don't kno-kno-know what I'm gonna do But someday I will find my way back To where your name Is written in the sand'Cause I remember every sunset I remember every word you said We were never gonna say goodbye Singing la-da-da-da-da Tell me how to get back to Back to summer paradise with you And I'll be there in a heartbeat Oh-oh I'll be there in a heartbeat Oh-ohAnother day is going by I'm thinking about you all the time But you're out there and I'm here waiting And I wrote this letter in my head'Cause so many things were left unsaid But now you're gone and I can't think straight This could be the one last chance to make you understand, yeah I'd do anything Just to hold you in my arms To try to make you laugh'Cause somehow I can't put you in the past I'd do anything Just to fall asleep with you Will you remember me 'Cause I know I won't forget you Together we broke all the rules Dreaming of dropping out of school And leave this place but never come back So now, maybe after all these years If you miss me, have no fear I'll be here, I'll be waitingCan anybody hear me Or am I talking to myself My mind is running empty In this search for someone else Who doesn't look right through me It's all just static in my head Can anybody tell me why I'm lonely like a satellite 'Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut Sending S.O.S  from this tiny box And I lost all signal when I lifted off Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot Can I please come down  'Cause I'm tired of driftin' around and 'round Can I please come down I'm deafened by the silence Is it somethin' that I've done I know that there are millions I can't be the only one Who's so disconnected It's so different in my head Can anybody tell me why I'm lonely like a satellite I gotta find my way back Back to summer paradise Sean Paul, Simple Plan My heart is sinking as I'm lifting Up above the clouds away from you And I can't believe I'm leaving Oh I don't kno-kno-know what I'm gonna do But someday I will find my way back to where Your name is written in the sand 'Cause I remember every sunset I remember every word you said And we were never gonna say goodbye Singing la-da-da-da-da Tell me how to get back to Back to summer paradise with you And I'll be there in a heartbeat Oh-oh I'll be there in a heartbeat Oh-oh Tell 'emI heard you're doing O KBut I want you to know I'm a dick I'm addicted to you I can't pretend I don't care When you don't think about me Do you think I deserve this I tried to make you happy But you left anyway I'm trying to forget that I'm addicted to you But I want it and I need it I'm addicted to you Now it's over Can't forget what you said And I never wanna do this again Heartbreaker Heartbreaker Heartbreaker Since the day I met you And after all we've been through Still a dick I'm addicted to you I think you know that it's true I'd run a thousand miles to get you Do you think I deserve this
