I've been cheated by you since I don't know when So I made up my mind: it must come to an end Look at me now, will I ever learn I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control There's a fire within my soul Just one look and I can hear a bell ring One more look and I forget everything, whoa Mamma mia, here I go again My my, how can I resist you Mamma mia, does it show again My my, just how much I've missed you Yes, I've been broken-hearted Blue since the day we parted Why, why did I ever let you go Mamma mia, now I really know My my, I could never let you go I've been angry and sad about things that you do I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through And when you go, when you slam the door I think you know that you won't be away too long You know that I'm not that strongYou can dance, you can jive Having the time of your life Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene Digging the dancing queen Friday night and the lights are low Looking out for a place to go Where they play the right music, getting in the swing You come to look for a king Anybody could be that guy Night is young and the music's high With a bit of rock music, everything is fine You're in the mood for a dance And when you get the chance You are the dancing queen Young and sweet, only seventeen Dancing queen Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah You can dance, you can jive Having the time of your life Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene Digging the dancing queenI don't wanna talk About things we've gone through Though it's hurting me, now it's history I've played all my cards And that's what you've done, too Nothing more to say, no more ace to play The winner takes it all The loser's standing small Beside the victory That's her destiny I was in your arms Thinking I belonged there I figured it made sense, building me a fence Building me a home Thinking I'd be strong there But I was a fool playing by the rules The gods may throw the dice Their minds as cold as ice And someone way down here Loses someone dear The winner takes it all The loser has to fall It's simple and it's plain Why should I complain  Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong You're enchained by your own sorrow In your eyes, there is no hope for tomorrow How I hate to see you like this There is no way you can deny it I can see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet Chiquitita, tell me the truth I'm a shoulder you can cry on Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on You were always sure of yourself Now, I see you've broken a feather I hope we can patch it up together Chiquitita, you and I know How the heartaches come and they go And the scars they're leaving You'll be dancing once again And the pain will end You will have no time for grieving Chiquitita, you and I cry But the sun is still in the sky And shining above you Let me hear you sing once more Like you did before Sing a new song, Chiquitita Try once more, like you did before Sing a new song, ChiquititaHalf-past twelve And I'm watching the late show in my flat, all alone How I hate to spend the evening on my own Autumn winds Blowing outside the window as I look around the room And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom There's not a soul out there No one to hear my prayer Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight Take me through the darkness to the break of the day Movie stars Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win It's so different from the world I'm living in Tired of T VI open the window and I gaze into the night But there's nothing there to see, no one in sightMy, my At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender Oh, yeah And I have met my destiny in quite a similar way The history book on the shelf Is always repeating itself Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you Woah, woah, woah, woah, Waterloo Finally facing my Waterloo My, my I tried to hold you back, but you were stronger Oh, yeah And now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight And how could I ever refuse I feel like I win when I loseSuper Trouper beams are gonna blind me But I won't feel blue Like I always do'Cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you I was sick and tired of everything When I called you last night from Glasgow All I do is eat and sleep and sing Wishing every show was the last show So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming Suddenly I feel all right And it's gonna be so different When I'm on the stage tonight Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me Shining like the sun Smiling, having fun Feeling like a number one Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me But I won't feel blue Like I always do 'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's youI've been cheated by you since I don't know when So I made up my mind: it must come to an end Look at me now, will I ever learn I
