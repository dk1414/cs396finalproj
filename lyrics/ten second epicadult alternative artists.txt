Beyond the common grind, the 9 to 5 The dead-end jobs we try, we try to hide We struggle through the means, to meet the end Please tell me that this life isn't permanent'Cause we don't care enough So don't hold it off You're what get's me off And gets me through long and sober days You don't deserve to be unnoticed You don't deserve to be treated like that We've gone to far to be unnoticed now Days and weeks go by and seasons change The scenery gets old it stays the same There's nothing in this town but you and I So baby pack your bags 'cause we leave tonight'Cause we don't care enough So don't hold it off You're what get's me off And gets me through long and sober daysYou said, "There's no way the days should feel this short As soon as one ends, the other starts"You say, "All day I feel you playing a part"When all you ever want to do was leave a mark Every day, another one wasted Every day, you get up and face it Every day, is a chance for redemption Every day, every day You said, "Time moves fast," but you're still staying in park As every chance takes off, you don't depart But it's just the defence for all the moments That name and define what we do Well how about you We're all scared of breaking through Every day, another one wasted Every day, you get up and face it Every day, is a chance for redemption Every day, every dayI'm not the only one I'm not the only one I know what your thinking I know what your thinking I know what your thinking, now Honestly, your carefree Life on weekends is starting to Tear us apart Honestly, why can't we Leave the nightlife for the lonely And spend your evening right beside me And when the drinks go down too fast You slow down baby It's time to come clean I'm not the only one I'm not the only one I know what your thinking I know what your thinking I know what your thinking, nowSomewhere in the world now You're getting out of bed You're standing on your own feet To shake your sleeping head If you win you take the credit If you lose you take the blame No one knows where you are And they never will again I can still remember The day you up and left I swear it was a moment I never will forget You said you'd take no prisoners But that's just what you did You took my heart captive Hope you know that you are missed Welcome to your lies, welcome to goodbye You see the big world through small town eyes Welcome to the point, the point of no return Let the past ignite and memories burnWaiting as the months are changing Hoping for the cards to fall my way The bad luck overstays But every time an underdog Is backed against a wall he will repay The ones who stole his day No one was counting on me coming through But I showed them the truth What do I got, what do I got to lose 'Cause all along, I carried on I found a way to pay the dues What do I got, what do I got to prove I'm fighting on, fighting on So if you're feeling the same way You're not alone I persevered, ignored the warnings Left to dig my heels into the sand To be a better man For every time they said I couldn't I will take a name and make a stand Make actions of my plansEight months it's been over now But over just can't be allowed Thought the score was settled But your lonely Things weren't getting better The phone call I remember Dialling 911 Was the next call I made Our time is gone It's long gone And I've learned To let you go Do you want to beat Wanna beat me to it Do you want to beat Wanna beat me to it I feel like you do, tonight Do you want to beat Wanna beat me to it Do you want to beat Wanna beat me to it I feel like you do, tonightYou're a ghost, the mistake I miss the most And I'm losing hold, 'cause all and all There's nothing left to change now You're exposed, when the heart and mind aren't closed A forgotten road that disappears Before I find a way to get you to stay You didn't change your mind, but you're not better off I couldn't take back time, I'm not better off So all that could've been is paper thin And we'll never know, we'll never know You're a curse, that can never be reversed And it's getting worse, when we both know That I'm the one to blame now And to you, how could I be untrue My grip's so loose, that holding on Is all that remains when you don't feel the same You didn't change your mind, but you're not better off I couldn't take back time, I'm not better off So all that could've been is paper thin And we'll never know, we'll never knowSometimes with life You salvage every kiss goodnight And climb to every mountain high But prairies are too flat Don't sell it out And curse the hand that waivers growth I won't trade this for the world'Cause this is my world Don't you, don't you try to Hold on, to the old town We've been through the bad times We've lasted the whole night A million lights from the plane above A million stories that bring push to shove And why do we keep looking forward When who we are is starring back Sally tells have longed for love It started in New Amsterdam She's gone, gone through change Gone through planes and magazines And that is all The church bells ringing through her head Some live life through the dotted line Some make the safe bet sounding off The good life, the one life The whole life, the old life The lasting single solitary World that you will know The good life, the one life The whole life, the old life The lasting single solitary World that you will know This counsel's faltered enough And shadows drag through the dusk And that's the way it Always goes downI know you think that it's impossible I felt the same, but I said it for the first time Anyway Seems like something's standing in your way Baby, you're not always Not always gonna feel like you do today If you don't, don't say it to me And if you don't, don't say it to me I think I've said enough, you should know That if you're not in love, it's worth a lifetime waiting for you To say it to me Just say it to me I know you thought that it was possible He's gone, and left you broken for the first time But you stayed You're finally out, but what's the price you paid
