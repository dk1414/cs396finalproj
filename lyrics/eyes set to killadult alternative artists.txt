Break The days are passing by The voices grow louder I can't get through the night Tossing and turning Wake up, nothing feels the same I'm not the person I was yesterday I can't find my center I've lost my temper again Feels like I'm gonna, feels like I'm gonna break I can't turn off my mind The voices take over me Try to contain them,  they drive me insane And I feel like I'm caving in I'm caving in, I'm caving Wake up, nothing feels the same I'm not the person I was yesterday I can't find my center I've lost my temper again Feels like I'm gonna, feels like I'm gonna breakDon't lie, don't lie to me now Now I'm erasing you Throwing those memories out Out to start something new I'm throwing those memories Darling, don't lie to me Darling, don't lie to me Darling, don't lie to me Darling don't Breathe in slowly now Darling don't lie to me Breathe in slowly now Darling don't lie to me Inhale truth I plead For you're my only, hope Don't lie, don't leave Mind set on failure The road you chose Told me you loved me Told me, noGlass hailed from the sky that night I couldn't hide to save my life Standing drenched in open wounds You took my hand, and pulled me through I want to give you everything I'll give you my all, because you gave me You gave me your lips, a gentle kiss The medicine to cure my pain Listen to all this glass shatter Once peirced my ears and made them bleed Now it sounds so beautiful Because you're beatiful You're beautiful I want to give you everything I'll give you my all, because you gave me You gave me your lips, a gentle kiss The medicine to cure my pain I want to give you everything Ill give you my all, because you gave me You gave me your lips, a gentle kiss The medicine to cure my painEvery day these voices Make me question myself Should I be somebody else My demons are awakening Won't let the pressure Take over me Won't let the pressure Take over me Ready to make my own way Or die trying I'm gonna break through the chains Ready to make my own way Or die trying Wipe the blood off my face I keep my head in the game Or die trying I'm gonna put up a fight Gonna risk my own life Or die trying I'm gonna break through the chains Ready to make my own way Or die tryingWhen all is said and done Where will you be You'll be staring right back Right back at me Never, never talk back to me Quiver at the sound That we scream Never been a fan of goodbyes You know that I'd rather leave you here to die You know that And when you say my name You get the best of me I feel, I can feel You're bitter You can't get over me Deliver Her body back to sea Won't let you be the death of me You know that Before it's over you will see The waves crashHush don't speak a word about the dreams that I live for It hurts to reach you when I'm down Don't speak again, I'm still waiting for my turn It hurts to reach you when i'm down My dreams are growing into Frustrations when i hear your voice Feeding me 'til I'm choking, feeding me 'til I'm choking My ears are ringing louder Repeating words that bring me down Ringing, my ears are bleeding, ringing, my ears are bleeding So hold your breath and spare me The pointless conversation, I'm running out of patience Don't blame me for trying to Hush don't speak a word about the dreams that I live for It hurts to reach you when I'm down Don't speak again, I'm still waiting for my turn It hurts to reach you when i'm down As you are moving forward I feel as if i can't catch up Trying so hard to reach you, trying so hard to reach you I'm stuck here at the bottom You're too high up to come back down Trying so hard to reach you, trying so hard to reach youSip my blood till there's no blood left to spill From my neck embraced by A concealed grip I welcomed in my arms, in my arms, in my arms Bruised by your love Burned by your kiss Is this true love Is this true love Young blood spills tonight This time the victim is you Poison lips, the ones you kiss I swear, my love for you is true Young blood spills Now here I sing My deadly lullaby Bruised by your love Burned by your kiss Is this true love Is this true love Bruised by your love Burned by your kiss Is this true love Is this true love I didn't think that we'd get so far I never thought that you had it in you Now we both got our battle scars Now we both got our new point of views And now I see you've become A bitter heart with no one To come home to We were young and stupid We thought that we might get through it Now you want an apology Now you want an apology It took two to make it It took one of us to break it Now you want an apology Now you want an apology Not sorry, not sorry Not sorry, no, no Not sorry, not sorry Not sorry, no, no I didn't think that you'd hurt so bad I recall that you didn't need me I never thought that you'd get so mad Call me selfish and call me crazy And now you see I've become A bigger heart with the one I hold on toI can't keep pacing I need your blood tonight You're so far from me And I'm so weak inside Come fly to me, I'll show you what it's like When the full moon shines We'll stop hearts together When we're conjoined at the lips I feel alive, I feel undead Pumping new life through these veins Holding onto the finest thread Take my hand, grip it tightly I promise pain will pass you silently, silently Take my hand, grip it tightly With your neck, I'll kiss you violently, violently To kiss my lips will leave you cold tonight You'll need my blood And I'll devote my life Come fly to me, I'll show you what it's like When the full moon shines We'll stop hearts togetherDo you feel like the world turned its back on you Like no one hears what you say Pouring your heart out in everything you do With no reward, just the pain You're stuck in the cycle Of setting the blame Don't think about where you are But where you could be The hardest part is letting go You've got to prove your life's hard And jump into the dark And when you find the light you'll know That it was always the struggle To leave it behind, let it go Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa You're ready to let it go It's like the place that you want to be Is right outside of your window So why is it so hard to reach out And step into the unknown
