There is a house in New Orleans They call the Rising Sun And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy And God, I know I'm one My mother was a tailor She sewed my new blue jeans My father was a gamblin' man Down in New Orleans Now the only thing a gambler needs Is a suitcase and a trunk And the only time he'll be satisfied Is when he's all drunk Oh, mother, tell your children Not to do what I have done Spend your lives in sin and misery In the House of the Rising SunInstrumental Intro Baby, do you understand me now Sometimes I feel a little mad But don't you know that no one alive Can always be an angel When things go wrong I seem to be bad But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree With a joy that's hard to hide And sometimes it seems that all I have do is worry And then you're bound to see my other side But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood If I seem edgy I want you to know That I never mean to take it out on you Life has its problems and I get my share And that's one thing I never meant to do Because I love you, oh Oh, oh baby don't you know I'm human Have thoughts like any other one Sometimes I find myself long regretting Some foolish thing some little simple thing I've doneIt's a hard world to get a break in All the good things have been taken But girl there are ways To make certain things pay Though I'm dressed in these rags I'll wear sable someday Hear what I say I'm gonna ride the serpent No more time spent Sweating rent Hear my command I'm breaking loose It ain't no use Holding me down Stick around But baby Remember It's my life, and I'll do what I want It's my mind, and I'll think like I want Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime But some day, I'll treat you real fineIn this dirty old part of the city Where the sun refused to shine People tell me there ain't no use in tryin'Now my girl, you're so young and pretty And one thing I know is true You'll be dead before your time is due, I know Watch my daddy in bed a-dyin'Watched his hair been turnin' grey He's been workin' and slavin' his life away Oh, yes I know it

He's been workin' and slavin' his life away I know he's been workin' so hardThe rooms were so much colder then My father was a soldier then And times were very hard When I was young When I was young I

was young When I was young I met my first love at thirteen She was brown and I was pretty green And I learned quite a lot When I was young When I was youngHe blesses the boys as they stand in line The smell of gun grease And the bayonets they shine He's there to help them all that he can To make them feel wanted he's a good holy man Sky pilot Sky pilot How high can you fly You'll never, never, never reach the sky He smiles at the young soldiers Tells them it's all right He knows of their fear in the forthcoming fight Soon there'll be blood and many will die Mothers and fathers back home they will cry Sky pilot Sky pilot How high can you fly You'll never, never, never reach the sky He mumbles a prayer and it ends with a smile The order is given They move down the line But he'll stay behind and he'll meditate But it won't stop the bleeding or ease the hateSittin' here lonely like a broken man Sell my time and doin' the best I can Walls and bars, they're surroundin' me But I don't want your sympathy, yeah Oh baby, oh baby I just need your tender lovin'To keep me sane in this burnin' oven When my time is up, be my rebirth Like Adam's work on God's green earth My rebirth, my
