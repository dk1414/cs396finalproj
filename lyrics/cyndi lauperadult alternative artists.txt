Lyin' in my bed, I hear the clock tick and think of you Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new Flashback, warm nights almost left behind Suitcase of memories Time after Sometimes you picture me, I'm walkin' too far ahead You're callin' to me, I can't hear what you've said Then you say, "Go slow", I fall behind The second hand unwinds If you're lost, you can look and you will find me Time after time If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting Time after time If you're lost, you can look and you will find me Time after time If you fall, I will catch you,  I will be waiting Time after time After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray Watchin' through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay Secrets stolen from deep inside The drum beats out of timeI come home in the morning light My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right "Oh, mama dear, we're not the fortunate ones And girls, they wanna have fun Oh, girls just wanna have fun The phone rings in the middle of the night My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life "Oh, daddy dear, you know you're still number one But girls, they wanna have fun Oh, girls just wanna have That's all they really want Some fun When the working day is done Oh, girls, they wanna have fun Oh, girls just wanna have fun Girls, they want, wanna have fun Girls, wanna have Some boys take a beautiful girl And hide her away from the rest of the world I wanna be the one to walk in the sun Oh, girls, they wanna have fun Oh, girls just wanna haveYou with the sad eyes Don't be discouraged Oh I realize It's hard to take courage In a world full of people You can lose sight of it all And the darkness inside you Can make you feel so small But I see your true color Shining through I see your true colors And that's why I love you So don't be afraid to let them show Your true colors True colors are beautiful Like a rainbow Show me a smile then Don't be unhappy Can't remember when I last saw you laughing If this world makes you crazy And you've taken all you can bear You call me up Because you know I'll be thereAll through the night I'll be awake, and I'll be with you All through the night This precious time when time is new Oh, all through the night today Knowing that we feel the same without saying We have no past, we won't reach back Keep with me forward all through the night And once we start the meter clicks And it goes running all through the night Until it ends, there is no end All through the night Stray cat is crying, so stray cat sings back All through the night They have forgotten what by day they lack Oh, under those white street lamps There is a little chance they may see We have no past, we won't reach back Keep with me forward all through the night And once we start the meter clicks And it goes running all through the night Until it ends, there is no endWell, I see 'em every night in tight blue jeans In the pages of a Blueboy magazine Hey, I've been thinking of a new sensation I'm picking up the good vibrations Oop, she bop, she bop Do I wanna go out with a lion's roar Yeah, I wanna go south and get me some more Hey, they say that a stitch in time saves nine They say I better stop or I'll go blind Oop, she bop, she bop She bop, he bop, a we bop I bop, you bop, a they bop Be bop, be bop, a lu bop She bop, he bop, a we bop I bop, you bop, a they bop Be bop, be bop, a lu, she bop Oh, she do, she bop Hey, hey they say I better get a chaperone Because I can't stop messing with the danger zone I won't worry, and I won't fret Ain't no law against it yet Oop, she bop, she bopHere we are Hanging onto strains of greed and blues Break the chain then we break down Oh, it's not real if you don't feel it Unspoken expectations Ideals you used to play with They've finally taken shape for us What's good enough for you Is good enough for me It's good enough It's good enough for me Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Now you'll say You're startin' to feel the push and pull Of what could be and never can You mirror me stumblin' through those Old fashioned superstitions I find too hard to break Oh, maybe you're out of placeI said, "I'm sorry, baby, I'm leaving you tonight I found someone new He's waiting in the car outside""Aw honey, how could you do it We swore each other everlasting love"I said, "Well yeah, I know, but when we did There was one thing we weren't thinking of, and that's money"Money changes everything I said money, money changes everything We think we know what we're doing That don't mean a thing It's all in the past now Money changes everything They shake your hand And they smile, and they buy you a drink They say, "We'll be your friends We'll stick with you 'til the end"Ah, but everybody's only looking out for themselves And you say, "Well who can you trust "I'll tell you, it's just nobody else's moneyI had to escape The city was sticky and cruel Maybe I should have called you first But I was dying to get to you I was dreaming while I drove The long straight road ahead, I Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide This fever for you is just burning me up inside I drove all night to get to you Is that all right I drove all night Crept in your room Woke you from your sleep To make love to you Is that all right I drove all night What in this world Keeps us from tearing apart No matter where I go I hear The beating of your heart I think about you When the night is cold and da-ah-arkWhen you were mine I gave you all of my money Time after time, huh You done me wrong Just like a train Let all my friends come over and eat You were so strange You didn't have the decency to change the sheets Oh, when you were mine Used to let you wear all of my clothes You were so fine Hah, baby, that's the reason that it hurt me so I know That you're going with another guy I don't care 'Cause I love you, baby, that's no lie I love you more than I did when you were mine When you were mine You were kinda sorta my best friend So, I was blind I let you fool around I never cared I never was the kind to make a fuss When he was there Sleeping in between the two of usI bought no gift this year And I slept with your sister I know I should have thought twice Before I kissed her But with the year we had last And the dress that she wore I just went along for the ride And I came back for more And I'm sorry baby...That's all O K honey, cause see...I bought no tree this year And I slept with your brother I wrecked your Daddy's car And went down on your Mother I set your record collection on fire And said I never knew Felt kind of bad about that And I know you did too So whatever you say, it's all fine by me Who the fuck anyway wants a Christmas tree Cause the snow keeps on fallin'Even though we were bad It'll cover the filth We should both just be glad
