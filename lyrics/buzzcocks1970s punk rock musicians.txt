I say what I mean I say what comes to my mind Because I never get around to things I live a straight, straight line You know me, I'm acting dumb You know the scene, very humdrum Boredom, boredom Boredom And now, I'm living in this movie But it doesn't move me And I've been waiting for the phone to ring Hear it ring-a-ring-a-ring, a fucking thing You know me, I'm acting dumb You know the scene, very humdrum Boredom, boredom Boredom You see, there's nothing that's behind me I'm already a has-been, uh Because my future ain't what it was Well, I think I know the words that I meanReality's a dream A game in which I seem to never find out just what I am I don't know if I'm an actor or ham, a shaman or sham But if you don't mind, I don't mind I'm lost without a clue So how can I undo the tangle of these webs I keep weaving I don't know if I should be believing, deceptive perceiving But if you don't mind, I don't mind I used to bet that you didn't care But gambling never got me anywhere Each time, I used to feel so sure Something about you made me doubt you more How can you convince me  When everything I see just makes me feel you're putting me down And if it's true, this pathetic clown'll keep hanging around I'm in love again Been like this before I'm in love again This time's true, I'm sure Don't wanna end up like no nine-day wonder I've been hurt so many times before So my darling, I will never leave you It's in my blood to always love you more, love you more It's my heart again That drives me so wild I just can't explain Although, I'm not a child So why would I cry if you ever left me  Maybe 'cause you're all I'm living for With every heartbeat, I want you madly It's in my blood to always love you more, love you more Oh my love, again What I say is true Though it may sound plain I love youI was so tired of being upset Always wanting something I never could get Life's an illusion, love is a dream But I don't know what it is Everybody's happy
