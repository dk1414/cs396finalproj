I'm crazy and that I am blind Risking it all in a glance And how you got me blind is still a mystery I can't get you out of my head Don't care what is written in your history As long as you're here with me I don't care who you are Where you're from, what you did As long as you love me Who you are, where you're from Don't care what you did As long as you love me Every little thing that you have said and done Feels like it's deep within me Doesn't really matter if you're on the run It seems like we're meant to beI got mixed emotions Did I finally find me a river That could lead me out to the ocean 'Cause I've only ever known the kind of love That leaves you battered and broken So forgive me for my mixed emotions, yeah yeah I'm not that kind of person Who can fall in and out of love with you That's not what love's supposed to do I'm not that kind of person Who can fall in and out of love with you That's not what love's supposed to do Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart'Cause it's the only one I've got'Cause it's the only one I've got Am I being too open 'Cause I told you everything I have to say And now we're having a moment Does it make you wanna pack up all your things And drive away like you stole it Just forgive me if I'm being too open No no no no, yeah yeah yeahShow me the meaning of being lonely So many words for the broken heart It is hard to see in a crimson love So hard to breathe Walk with me and maybe Nights of light so soon become Wild and free I could feel the sun Your every wish will be done They tell me Show me the meaning of being lonely Is this the feeling I need to walk with Tell me why I can't be there where you are There is something missing in my heart Life goes on as it never ends Eyes of stone observe the trends They never say forever gaze, if only Guilty roads to an endless love There is no control, are you with me now Your every wish will be done They tell meWhat if I never run into you What if you never smiled at me What if I had noticed you too And you never showed up where I happened to be What's a girl like you doing in a place like this On a quiet night, what are the odds What's a guy like me doing in a place like this I could have just walked by, who would have thought What are the chances that we'd end up dancing Like two in a million, like once in a life I could have found you, put my arms around you Like two in a million, like once in a life What are the chances What if I hadn't asked for your name And time hadn't stopped when you said it to me  Oh Of all of the plans that I could have made Of all of the nights that I couldn't sleep, oh What's a girl like you doing in a place like this In a crowded room, what are the odds Getting close to you, but here we areI've been to Paris, made my way down to Rome Seen the sun setting on the beach in Mexico But I could care less, 'cause I was all alone And there ain't no way to touch your body over the phone I've been all around the world, done all there is to do But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to You're a wild night with a hell of a view There ain't no place, ain't no place like you There ain't no place, ain't no place like you You're my daybreak, you're my California sun You're my Memphis, New York, New Orleans all rolled into one In the city, the country, the mountains or sea Wherever you are, baby, that's where I wanna be I've been all around the world, done all there is to do But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to You're a wild night with a hell of a view There ain't no place, ain't no place like you There ain't no place, ain't no place like you, noHa Yeah-ha-ha-ha-ha  Woo Ha-ha-ha-ha!I may run and hide When you're screamin' my name, alright But let me tell you now There are prices to fame, alright All of our time spent In flashes of light All you people, can't you see, can't you see How your love's affecting our reality Every time we're down, you can make it right And that makes you larger than life Lookin' at the crowd And I see your body sway, come on Wishin' I could thank you In a different way, come onHmm, mmmh, yeah, yeah Baby, please try to forgive me Stay here, don't put out the glow Hold me now don't bother If every minute it makes me weaker You can save me from the man That I've become, oh yeah Looking back on the things I've done I was trying to be someone I played my part, kept you in the dark Now let me show you the shape of my heart Sadness is beautiful Loneliness that's tragical So help me I can't win this war, oh no Touch me now, don't bother If every second it makes me weaker You can save me from the man I've become Looking back on the things I've done I was trying to be someone I played my part, kept you in the dark Now let me show you the shape of my heartBaby, oh-oh Even in my heart, I see You're not being true to me Deep within my soul, I feel Nothing's like it used to be Sometimes I wish I could turn back time Impossible as it may seem But I wish I could so bad, baby Quit playing games with my heart Quit playing games with my heart Before you tear us apart Quit playing games with my heart I should have known from the start You know you have got to stop You are tearing us apart Quit playing games with my heart I live my life the way To keep you coming back to me Everything I do is for you So what is it that you can't see
