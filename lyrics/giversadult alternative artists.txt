Oh, we up up up for the glow show Yeah we down down here on the ground Yeah we up up up up above love Yeah we up up up in the clouds Yeah we up, yeah we up Yeah we up, yeah we up You're gonna find your way, find your way to be You're gonna get yourself a land with your old man You'll get it free, you'll get it free It's the way now, way to see'Cause it's inside and out with no doubt It's in everything, it's in everything Oh, we up up up for the glow show Yeah we down down here on the ground Yeah we up up up up above love Yeah we up up up in the clouds Yeah we up, yeah we up Yeah we up, yeah we up You're gonna find your way, find your way to be Yeah you're gonna get yourself aligned with your own spine You'll get it free, you'll get it freeSome time ago I was glidin' by Racing time, reaching out for your love When it hit me it knocked me out Calmed me down, pushed me up just enough For a while I was flying high, chasing the sun Set it off in the wild There you were, you were calling back Pushing me off this cliff and up into the-Light And you feel it collide with your night When you see it coming after you don’t hide Can you feel it collide with your night Can you feel it  Can you feel it All the pieces they come undone Build em up, break them down into dust And it convinced me to make that drive Take that fall, open the window enough And for a while I was crying loud Bleeding out, wishing my way through the dark There you were, you were calling back Pushing me off this cliff and up into the-Please come back Home to Bermuda Please come back Home to Bermuda Back at your town, your carpet choice Fat and feeling there’s no reason to avoid Keep proving everything Till you prove the stuff you got Won’t complain at all Push too far Didn’t wanna follow it up And once recites Can we hear you now Cuz in the night singing that I will sing what’s writing on the wing Cuz my vision’s sharp through love and pain Racing up in you love, whisper an idea Yeah, these visions start with a common thread coming through Great watch we wave as we say goodbyeI saw you first It was in a dream, it was in a dream It was in a dream, it was in a dream I knew it’d work Or so it seemed, or so it seems Or so it seems, or so it seems While you hold on Let that Golden go Golden goes on So don’t hold it Oh no, oh no Oh no ,oh no In the light, there’s still stormin’In the shade, there’s still warmin’You’ll see What you’ll be In the grey, there’s still colors Without fade, inside lovers We’ll be Yeah, we’ll beIt's that desire over love I have to turn around and come right back to bay'Cause you're my ceiling of plankton You hold the white light much better And you know You got that keeping it warm Not too tight, just like my favorite sweater And you glow a purple star And when you notice all your stars are in line Yes, yes you'll find me I'll be there waiting right behind And when you notice that your heart is bleeding Mine is bleeding too That magic walk that's in your sky I'll give you all my guts You make me still, you make me blush You make me go out my own mind And when you notice all your stars are in line Yes, yes you'll find me I'll be there waiting right behind And when you notice that your mind is fleeting Mine is fleeting too That magic walk that's in your skyHiding from reality We're lost in a dream, reaching out for more Nothing can erase all I've seen I make another fastback round on you darling I've been paying our toys, what happens when you lose Is it something you just get used to Is it getting old They say there's no use in running Just like you can't escape the sun Baby, 'cause your love's like fire Your love is like a fire Your love is like fire I'm always getting burnt You see my softness as a weakness But I assure you it's not so go ahead and take it I go more where in vacant where it's coming from We're all cowards in the backyard Then the scene is getting cold, who knows it truly Everyone's afraid to leave and there was youOh, we up up up for the glow show Yeah we down down here on the ground Yeah we up up up up above love Yeah we up up up in the clouds Yeah we up, yeah we up Yeah we up, yeah we up You're gonna find your way, find your way to be You're gonna get yourself a land with your old man You'll get it free, you'll get it free It's the way now, way to see'Cause it's inside and out with no
