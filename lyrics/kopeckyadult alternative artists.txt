What do we do with the words that we're saying Never met you before, but I'll know you, I'm sure The worst part is that this night ends What do I do with the words you've been saying With my feet in the sand, and your back to the east I'm facing you, you're facing My love You've been waiting for my love You've been waiting for my love I've been waiting for you, waiting for you Woo!All of my ghosts are here speaking politely Saying it's time, so I'll walk away slowly What a pleasure it's been, so for now let's pretend The worst part is, the worst part is My love You've been waiting for my

my eye on you I'm watching you I've got my eye I am watching you I've got my eye on you Watching you I've got my eye Oh my wandering eyes nothing's gonna take me by surprise I know nothing's gonna take me by surprise Oh my wandering eyes nothing's gonna take me by surprise I know nothing's gonna take me by surprise For what it's worth beyond this dirt On complicated lies I surf The tide is rising high up to the sun telepathic is my mind Walking with the passerbys The creatures never notice what I've done I am watching you I've got my eye on you I'm watching you I've got my eye I am watching you I've got my eye on you Watching you I've got my eye Oh my wandering eyes nothing's gonna take me by surprise I know nothing's gonna take me by surprise Oh my wandering eyes nothing's gonna take me by surprise I know nothing's gonna take me by surpriseIf you find the road is winding Stage a turn and wipe the bend Take what's yours if you're inclined to Leave the rest and come again The glow is coming We're almost home Just keep on running No more sleeping We don't got time Just keep on running When you find this road is winding Strangers still lies right around the bend All you left is right behind you Slightly strained but still intact The glow is coming We're almost home Just keep on running No more sleeping We don't got time Just keep on running The glow is coming We're almost home Just keep on running No more sleeping We don't got time Just keep on runningNow it's just God and me Playing our parts just to see who believes And he rules the world through his teeth Taking his time And slowly bringing us down Could you stop it Could you stop it This sinking feeling The mess i'm in i'm not quite sure But it looks a lot like yours Could you stop it Could you stop it This sinking feeling The mess i'm in i'm not quite sure But it looks a lot like yours Now it's just god and me Playing our parts just to see who believes And he rules the world through his teeth Taking his time And slowly bringing us down down down Slowly brining us down down down Slowly brining us down down down Slowly brining us down down down
