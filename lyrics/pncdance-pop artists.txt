the plate up I’m on the track, kick the plate up I’m twisted up The liquor’s in my arteries Kitchen top looking similar to pharmacies They ran their mouth Now we’re finding out the talk's tall I’m coming out That means fire for your aux cord I see their clips So all I’m hearing is my son’s flow But fuck the kids All I care is that my funds grow Who got the codes Let’s reel it on a laptop I run the game since the days I had a mascot No introduction needed My circumference undefeated Every hand I play is royal flush And then I just repeat it Beat em to death in fact I hit like Stephen stepping back We still about our cash money You better put respect on that Rappin' that gruesome music And it's Patrick who produced it Do this on my own You know I never had to super-group it New shit to flood the net I been through hell but nonetheless I still telling my tale until my body fail and come to restDark clouds in the bright lights Cheap women pay the high price Passed out on the rock and roll End up familiar with the so and so's Packed shows full of the unanimous Seeing black crows, feeling ominous Take the solace in a bottle You can bet that its on again tomorrow You can bet A repeat of original sin In the home of the Devil might as well move in Moving like The Walking Dead We got the virus We need supplies to ignite us for the night It's what we do, huh, how you doing Bruh I need Jack and Jim to get thru bruh And I am back in the mindset Can you really risk it all when there is nothing at stake Wait...If it wasn't for the Love I was showing now Could have been another two meters below with a Tombstone reading, "Gone to soon though"Any minute I can see my final moon glow Any minute trying to live it like the world's got a comet about to hit it and we're done for every cynical night in a dark space I know that I can make it to a sun-rise See myself in the eyes of a daughter or a son before I can take flight To the spiritual or the ship you left weighing you down, It's nothing to take light I take Pride Like a lion when he leads Never trying to appease Please It's fight time rather die standing on these Nike's than living the life on my knees Until then..
