What will people think when they hear that I'm a Jesus freak  What will people do  when they find that it's true Ho, ho Ho, ho, ho-oh Ho, ho Separated, I cut myself clean From a past that comes back in my darkest of dreams Been apprehended by a spiritual force And a grace that replaced all the me I've divorced I saw a man with a tat on his big fat belly It wiggled around like marmalade jelly It took me a while to catch what it said'Cause I had to match the rhythm of his belly wit' my head"Jesus Saves" is what it raved in a typical tattoo green He stood on a box in the middle of the city and he claimed he had a dream What will people think when they hear that I'm a Jesus freak What will people do when they find that it's true  I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak There ain't no disguisin' the truth 1, 2, 3, 4 Pardon me, your epidermis is showing, sir I couldn't help but note your shade of melanin I tip my hat to the colorful arrangement'Cause I see the beauty in the tones of our skin We've gotta come together And thank the Maker of us all We're colored people, and we live in a tainted place We're colored people, and they call us the human race We've got a history so full of mistakes And we are colored people who depend on a holy grace1, 2, 3, 4 A piece of canvas is only the beginning for It takes on character with every loving stroke This thing of beauty is the passion of an artist's heart By God's design, we are a skin kaleidoscopeThe greatest single cause of atheism in the world today Is Christians who acknowledge Jesus with their lips Then walk out the door and deny him by their lifestyle That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable What if I stumble What if I fall Is this one for the people Is this one for the Lord Or do I simply serenade For things I must afford You can jumble them together My conflict still remains Holiness is calling In the midst of courting fame Cause I see the trust in their eyes Though the sky is falling They need Your love in their lives Compromise is calling What if I stumble What if I fall What if I lose my step And I make fools of us all Will the love continue When my walk becomes a crawl What if I stumble And what if I fall I keep trying to find a life On my own, apart from you I am the king of excuses I've got one for every selfish thing I do What's going on inside of me I despise my own behavior This only serves to confirm my suspicions That I'm still a man in need of a savior I wanna be in the Light As you are in the Light I wanna shine like the stars in the heavens Oh, Lord be my Light and be my salvation Cause all I want is to be in the Light All I want is to be in the Light The disease of self runs through my blood It's a cancer fatal to my soul Every attempt on my behalf has failed To bring this sickness under controlLovely traces I can sense you in everything The way that you move me Takes me far away I seek no escape I'm dreaming through your eyes I am wandering through your mind I'm overtaken By the way that you deliver me I'm transcended There's no place I'd rather be Than here in heaven Without you I'm incomplete It's hopeless You consume me, You consume me Like a burning flame running through my veins You consume me moving through me Anytime, anyplace, you invade my space You consume me, You consume me Wholly devoted I immerse myself in you Baptize me in your love Cause drowning in the thought of you Floods my soul I'm taken by the things you do God you know It doesn't matter what I lose I'm yoursDo do do do do Do do do do Do do do do do Do do do Kick it for me one time Oh, yeah, yeah Jesus is still all right with me Jesus is still all right, oh, yeah Jesus is still all right with me Jesus is still all right You know that He's all right   Toby Mac, and the Mac is back, no slack On a D C track that's jacked Beyond comprehension I believe that I failed to mention That there's a lack of recognition When it comes to His position 'Cause if Christ can't be crossed over Then I'll keep my beat up nova Some people out there givin' rap a bad name Well, I'm here to let you know We ain't down with that Yeah!Oh, yeah A-hey, yeah Come on: the sound of the times Ya sorta talk lyrics to rhythm and rhyme And then deliver in various ways You know, some sorta preach and some sorta play Nevertheless, there's some common ground Ya know the def hip-hop sound Hyped up bass with a tiny snare The subwoofer makes ya neighbor stare But still I…I love rap music I always have and I always will Drop it Now rap started as the voice of the streets A sorta politics to a ghetto beat Then rappers started braggin' all about their gold And the girlies and the beepers and the big, black Olds In '83, the beatbox hit A-makin' funky drum sounds from out ya lips But takin' on new forms, rap has moved from the block Now some mix it with soul and some mix it with rock , ya knowThe other night I met a girl and she looked to be so nice I asked her for the digits and she didn't think twice A couple of days later, called her up and asked her out She said "With you " I said "With me," and then she said "Without a doubt." I took her to the garden where I guess they grow the olives She wore a tighter skirt than any I had seen in college She said, "I love to smoke and drink while cursin' like a sailor."I asked her where she got her mouth and if she had a tailor Finally, I walked her to the door to say good night She said, "I am an apple  Would you care to take a bite " Politely, I refused and said, "I'm lookin' for a lady."So she slapped me *slap* in my face and said, "Boy, you must be crazy."D-different from the ones before Different from the ones before She's that kind of girl Different from the ones before'Cause I know she loves the Lord She's that kind of girl Virtuous in every way The kind of girl that makes you say"I hope she comes my way."Well, I'm lookin' for a girl who's virtuous'Cause God laid it on my heart to search for this So I open up the Word to the book of Proverbs The 31st chapter tells me all about her Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain A woman who fears the Lord, she ain't playin'Hear what I'm sayin' 'cause I'm sayin' it clearly She's the kinda girl I gots to have near meDo you copy S-E-X is test when I'm pressed So back up off with less of that zest Impress this brother with a life of virtue The innocence that's spent is gonna hurt you Safe is the way they say to play Then again safe ain't safe at all today So just wait for the mate that's straight from God And don't have sex 'til ya tie the knot I don't want it, I don't want it, want it I don't want it, want your sex for now I don't want it, I don't want it, want it I don't want it 'til we take the vows Girl, it's gonna take a little time for us to see That love is simply more than fulfillin' the need Respect  is what we need to find the cure for this disease And trust  in God above to shape our lives in harmony Do you copy That's why I'm sayin'…Give 'em somethin'Give 'em a lil' somethin'Go ahead, man, break it down When you really break it down…We're just two honks and a negro Servin' the Lord We're just two honks and a negro Singin' our song*laughter*
