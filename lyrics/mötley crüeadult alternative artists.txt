You know I'm a dreamer But my heart's of gold I had to run away high So I wouldn't come home low Just when things went right It doesn't mean they were always wrong Just take this song and you'll never feel Left all alone Take me to your heart Feel me in your bones Just one more night And I'm coming off this Long and winding road I'm on my way I'm on my way Home sweet home Tonight, tonight I'm on my way I'm on my way Home sweet home You know that I've seen Too many romantic dreams Up in lights Falling off the silver screen My heart's like an open book For the whole world to read Sometimes nothing Keeps me together At the seamsNow listen up She's a razor sharp If she don't get her way She'll slice you apart Now she's a cool, cool black She moves like a cat If you don't get her name Well, you might not make it back She's got the looks that kill, that kill, oh She's got the looks that kill, that kill, oh She's got the look Now she's bulletproof She keeps her motor clean And believe me, you She's a number thirteen The church strikes midnight She's looking louder and louder She's going to turn on our juice, boy So she turns on the powerFriday night and I need a fight My motorcycle and a switchblade knife Handful of grease in my hair feels right But what I need to make me tight are those Girls, girls, girls Long legs and burgundy lips Girls, girls, girls Dancing down on Sunset Strip Girls, girls, girls Red lips, fingertips Trick or treat, sweet to eat On Halloween and New Years Eve Yankee girls, you just can't be beat But they're the best when they're off their feet Girls, girls, girls At the Dollhouse in Fort Lauderdale Girls, girls, girls Rocking in Atlanta at Tattletale Girls, girls, girls Raising hell at the Seventh VeilKneel down you sinners to streetwise religion Greed's been crowned the new king Hollywood dream teens, yesterday's trash queens Save the blessings for the final ring, amen Take a ride on the wild side Wild side I carry my crucifix under my death list Forward my mail to me in hell Liars and the martyrs lost faith in the Father Long lost is the wishing well Take a ride on the wild side Wild side Fallen angels so fast to kill Thy Kingdom come on the wild side Our Father, who ain't in heaven Be Thy name on the wild side Holy Mary, Mother, may I Pray for us on the wild side Wild side, wild sideWooh!Do you ever seem to have one of those days Where everyone's on your case From your teacher all the way down To your best girlfriend Well, yâ€™know I used to have those about all the time But I found a way to get out of it Let me tell you about!I'm sitting in the classroom thinking it's a drag Listening to the teacher rap, it just isn't my bag When two bells ring, you know it's my cue I'm gonna meet the boys on floor number two Smoking in the boys room Smoking in the boys room Now Teacher, don't you fill me up with your rule'Cause everybody knows that smoking ain't allowed in school Checking out the halls, making sure the coast is clear Looking in the stalls, nah, there ain't nobody here My buddies, Sixx, Mick, and Tom To get caught would surely be the death of us allYou say our love Is like dynamite Open your eyes It's like fire and ice Well, you're killing me Your love's a guillotine Why don't you just set me free Too young to fall in love I'm too young Too young to fall in love I'm too young Too young to fall in love I'm too young Too young to fall in love I'm too young Too young to fall in love I'm too young,  too young To fall in love Run for the hills We're both sinners and saints Not a woman, but a whore I can taste the hate Well, now I'm killing you Watch your face turning blue Not yet a man Just a punk in the streetThe sex, the cash, the fame Living out a life you can't deny The drugs, the lies, the pain Will never get enough to satisfy They never found a way to break us down That's why we're still around Gimme the dirt, just gimme the dirt Just gimme what I want 'til it hurts Just gimme the dirt, gimme the dirt Let's take it to the top and watch it burn The fight, the hate, the game Not afraid to stab you from behind The years, the months, the days Never gave a fuck about the time They never found a way to break us down That's why we're still aroundRat-tailed Jimmy is a second hand hood Deals out in Hollywood Got a '65 Chevy, primered flames Traded for some powdered goods Jigsaw Jimmy, he's the

This love that I tell Now feels lonely as hell From this padded prison cell So many times I said You'd only be mine I gave my blood and my tears And loved you, cyanide When you took my lips I took your breath Sometimes love's better off dead You're all I need Make you only mine So I set you free I had to take your life You're all I need You're all I need And I loved you so But you didn't love
