I never understood before I never knew what love was for My heart was broke, my head was sore What a feeling Tied up in ancient history I didn't believe in destiny I look up, you're standing next to me What a feeling What a feeling in my soul Love burns brighter than sunshine Brighter than sunshine Let the rain fall, I don't care I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine Suddenly, you're mine And it's brighter than sunshine I never saw it happening I'd given up and given in I just couldn't take the hurt again What a feeling I didn't have the strength to fight Suddenly, it seemed so right Me and you What a feelingThere's a song we sing Elemental sound Where it all begins It can draw you in Drag you out But it's hard to hear That distant voice Oh it would ring so clear If we could only tune out the noise To the wonder There's a song you know If you listen close It will always be As it always was Elemental sound Running underneath it all To the wonder To the wonderI've been watching your world from afar I've been trying to be where you are And I've been secretly falling apart Unseen To me, you're strange and you're beautiful You'd be so perfect with me But you just can't see You turn every head but you don't see me I'll put a spell on you You'll fall asleep When I put a spell on you And when I wake you I'll be the first thing you see And you'll realize that you love me Yeah Ye-ah Sometimes the last thing you want comes in first Sometimes the first thing you want never comes But I know that waiting is all you can do SometimesI look up, I look down But all I see is you I look left, I look right But all I see is you You got me surrounded I tried everything I can But I know that you're my only way out You got me surrounded My love, I ain't fighting anymore And I know that you're my only way out I look back I looked in front of me And all I felt was this So I run away and I hide away But all I felt was this Ah oh, ah oh-oh, ah oh No more, you got me surrounded You got me surrounded I tried everything I can But I know that you're my only way out You got me surrounded My love, I ain't fighting anymore And I know that you're my only way outWe're two spinning spheres Two spinning spheres In a bed of stars Silence is super Staring into space I wonder where you are You're all that I've ever needed I know that you want to feel it Drift out into the darkness Lost out on the horizon It's alright, it's alright I'll be your respirator I'll be your pressure suit It's alright, it's alright Violently clear The upper atmosphere Raging out your heart Somewhere far beneath Your pointed tognue and teeth Is where you really are I don't want to be be forgiven But drag you down from where you areI got trampstamped in Santa Monica Shame on me Got told off for taking a piss on Malibu beach I am smoking in my rental Shame on me With that V IP chit Chat with a lizard on heat I been negging on the teenage dream Shame on me But feeling stronger in this plastic fantasy I've lived in fear of younger, better Shame on me I even Considered early booking at the Westwood cemetery But this is working now Yes this is working now Oh yeah The pressure's easing now The weight is lifting now Oh yeah I'm on that open road And there is no one in my lane And I will be what I want And I will do it my way I'm on that open road And there is no one in my lane Here I go talking trash again Shame on me Hopefully critical but I call it jealousy Bite the blade and get into the tub Cos I'm always do down in the Dumps When on paper I'm pulling up trumps Yeah shame on meI never understood before I never knew what love was for My heart was broke, my head was sore What a feeling Tied up in ancient history I didn't believe in destiny I look up, you're standing next to me What a feeling What a feeling in my soul Love burns brighter than sunshine Brighter than sunshine Let the rain fall, I don't care I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine Suddenly, you're mine And it's brighter than sunshine I never saw it happening I'd given up and given in I just couldn't take the hurt again What a feeling I didn't have the strength to fight Suddenly, it seemed so right Me and you What a
