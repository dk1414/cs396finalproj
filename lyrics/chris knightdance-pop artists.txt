I was eighteen My brother was twenty-one One Saturday evening When all the work was done We went down to the river Had some trot lines to run My brother Walter Had a fight the week before Knocked a boy named Wilson Through the pool hall door They said you don't mess with Wilson Unless you want a war I put the boat in the water And I made the engine run I loaded the lantern Against a sinking sun And my brother Walter Was loading his gun And we went down the river Down past the coal docks We were runnin' our lines Heard some drunken boaters Racing up behind It was Wilson and his cousin Had trouble on their mindsThere ought to be a town somewhere Named for how I feel Yeah I could be the mayor down there And say "welcome to sorryville"It wouldn't be on a map no where You might say that it don't exist But if you make enough wrong turns It'da be hard to miss There ought to a bridge somewhere they could dedicate to me I'd probably come to the ceremony with a can of gasoline Walk on over to the other side Where I'd light a match Sit and stare through the smoke and flames and wonder how I'm gonna get back Why do I do the things I do Was I born this way or am I self-made fool I shoot the lights and I curse the dark I need your love but I break your heart And I know the words that'll bring you back but But I don't say nothing as I watch you pack I had to work to become the jerk I've come to be It ain't easy being me There oughta be a side show act For freaks like me I could be the star of the show w/ my name on the marquee In a room with a big red button that says "danger do not touch"Twice a day I'd mash it down and you can watch me self-destruct Why do I do the things I do Was I born this way or am I self made fool I shoot the lights and I curse the dark I need your love but I break your heart And I know the words to get you back but But I don't say nothing as I watch you pack I had to work to become the jerk I've come to be It ain't easy being me It ain't easy being meWell I work for the city in the town where I grew up Some days I run a backhoe some days I run a dump If I had other plans on my graduation day Then several years ago I guess I hauled 'em all away Yeah I hauled 'em all away She told me she was pregnant on the day I turned 18 I did what your supposed to do  I bought her a ring He didn't have to ask us, but he asked us anyway We stood up and said, "I do." what else were we gonna say What else were we gonna say Well I'm thankful for the things I have And all the things I don't And I've got dreams that will come true And I've got some that won't Most the time I just walk the line wherever it goes'Cuz you can't hang yourself if you ain't got enough rope My boss man is the Mayor  I do just what he asks I mow the courthouse lawn, watch the prisoners walkin' past I'm happy to be working, instead of wearin' chains Like my cousin Willy, he's locked up in La Grange He's locked up in La Grange But I'm thankful for the things I have And all the things I don't And I've got dreams that will come true I've got some that won't Most the time I just walk the line wherever it goes'Cuz you can't hang yourself if you ain't got enough ropePictures on her wall, a bible in her hand Children never call, she misses her old man Rain on the window, quiet as a tear And if you never felt 'em, never know they're here Someone's cryin' in the hall Good Lord, help us all While we try to stay afloat If you would, Lord, send a boat Holes in the wall, a bottle by his bed Holes in his past, empty as his head He's younger when he dreams, he's older than his years And if he never wakes up, he'll know why he's here Someone's cryin' in the hall Good Lord, help us all While we try to stay afloat If you would, Lord, send a boat The writing's on the wall, there's a bruise on his face Daddies come and go, his momma's on a date He's just cold and hungry, and playin' ain't no fun And if he ever grows up, he'll get him a gun Someone's cryin' in the hall Good Lord, help us all While we try to stay afloat If you would, Lord, send a boat If you would, Lord, send a boatI caught a .22 bullet inn the thigh one night Trying to break up a barroom fight Went home, cut it out with my ol' Case knife Broke down in a blizzard on the great divide Walked twenty miles 'til I caught a ride Trooper said, "Boy it's a wonder you're still alive"I've rode hard luck I've been bruised and bucked I've been hitting the ground And turning around And getting back up And they're laying 'em off down at Kankakee And there's boards on the windows up and down the street And they're saying that it's gonna get darker before the dawn But you can bet your ass I'll keep the lights on Keep my babies fed and throw my dog a bone Cause I'm a bring it on, git 'er done, don't run S.O.B Times are tough But they ain't got nothing on me I got a three-legged dog I call Jake Got the won't back down scars on his face He tussled with a bear and he came in second placeYeah, man it's messed up times Half the world's done lost its mind The rest are looking for a sign Just to hold on to You can't believe what's on the news They lie to your face is what they do They think we're all just a bunch of fools And that's the damn truth The way I see it That's the damn truth Take it or leave it It don't change You better believe it We live in a world of lies That's the damn truth Booze and drugs will rot your brain Too much pleasure brings you pain But you can die from just about anything The past is better off left behind Worry is always a waste of time Money ain't always the bottom lineI've got a house and 90 acres some cattle in the barn Two kids with no mama, she left in a saleman's arms A sign by the mailbox says there's an auction in the Yard Born and raised has been damn easy but lately living's Hard The children miss their mama but there ain't nothing I Can do If she was all I had to worry about well I'd guess I'd Miss her too But I've watched my tools and tractor leave in someone Else's hands I grit my teeth, I'm let 'em go but I won't give up my Land This house and 90 acres, the only place I've left to Stand My roots are anchored solid, I ain't machinery I'm a Man I'll be here in the morning come pouring rain or sun This house and 90 acres What's said is good as done There's jobs up in the city I could probably drive a Truck Or I could move 300 miles from home but that would be Giving up Well you know that I ain't leaving if it's just my Pride I save I might be on the front porch or I might be in a Hillside grave This house and 90 acres, the only place I've left to Stand My roots are anchored solid, I ain't machinery I'm a Man I'll be here in the morning come pouring rain or sun This house and 90 acres What's said is good as done This house and 90 acres What's said is good as doneYou're my guardrail when I'm on the road You're my shelter from the rain and cold When my candle is burning low You're my beacon, I know where to go You're the plain truth when the story's told You're the punch line to my favorite joke You're my best friend, you're my leaning post You're my angel when I'm seeing ghosts I'm staring out the door of a motel room Waitin' for the the sun to stare down the moon Another long night The rates are low but the cost is high If I didn't have you, I'd never get by It's all right, it's almost daylight After Houston, it's San Antone Miles of lonely but I'm not alone You're the reason I ain't turned to stone I'm a gypsy on my way homeLisa used to love to dance Ever since she was ten years old Her bare feet raising dust on a yard Where the grass wouldn't grow Slowly spinning round and round To the music playing in her head Late at night it could almost drown out The whiskey on her old man's breath The wrecking yards and dingy bars And abandoned factories But down among the jagged souls A ballerina sways unseen Hard edges hide a tender heart Silent as a midnight prayer Hard edges hide the sweetest part Till you'd never know it's there Lisa's in a club downtown Where the neon burns till dawn She calls herself Tina now But she dances to the same old songs Slowly spinning round and round In the smoke and the smell of rye She takes off all her clothes So they don't see down in her eyesKansas wheat fields don't ask questions Like most the folks I met But if this storm don't stop the harvest There's a chance I might forget I'm tryin' not to think about you But when this combine Rocks-N-Rolls It shakes my mind, it shakes my body The way your leavin' shook my soul Here comes the rain Here comes the rain It's like standin' in your memory And the feeling of it chills me to the bone Here comes the rain Here comes the rain When you love, the world loves with you But when you're cryin' in the rain you cry alone I'm workin Texas to Alberta Thrashin' amber waves of grain Fillin' trucks from dawn to sunset I wish they'd haul away the pain There'll be a thousand miles between us When I pass the border guard Is that thunder in the distance Or just the breaking of my heart Here comes the rain Here comes the rain It's like standin' in your memory And the feeling of it chills me to the bone Here comes the rain Here comes the rain When you love the world loves with you But when you're cryin' in the rain you cry alone Here comes the rain Here comes the rain When you love the world loves with you But when you're cryin' in the rain you cry alone
