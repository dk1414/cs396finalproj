She can wear a nightgown to a wedding A t-shirt to bed Or short skirts in the olden times Some daisies wrapped 'round her head You can find my woman dancing in bare feet On the couch in a ballroom dress And I love how my baby looks at me With arms draped 'round my neck I said, "Oh, honey, just like that"I give you my loving and you give it right back I said, "Oh, honey, just like this"Hanging on, white knuckle grip Feel something when I kiss you goodnight Feel something when I open my eyes Feel that I could be your sweetest compromise It's all on my mind It's all on my mindWhat would it take To make you want me What would it take To make you love me Would it take flowers Red roses from vines Would it take diamonds To let you know you were mine Well, I'll take you dancing Sweep you off your feet What do you need To know you're the only one, one for me And what would it take To make you love me What would it take To make you love me What words can I say Tell me, what can I do And all that I am And I'll give it to you I can make you smile Give you all your dreams And I'd give everything To make you love me Oh, andThere's a girl in Shelbyville Gave her life to Jesus First Antioch Baptist Church, where her dad preaches She's pretty as her mama; she's only 23 And she could be an angel, Lord Cause she's bringing out the devil in me Lord, forgive me for what I'm thinking Cause it's Saturday night and I'm high and I've been drinking But come tomorrow morning across the aisle I look over and see her smile Bow my head and the choir sings Lord, forgive me; she's bringing out the devil in me Sundress on a willow tree Smooth on the water I know the Lord's been good to me when I look at the preacher's daughter But she's my Delilah; she brings me to my knees And she could be an angel Cause she's bringing out the devil in me Lord, forgive me for what I'm thinking Saturday night and I'm high and I've been drinking But come tomorrow morning across the aisle I look over and see her smile Bow my head and the choir sings Lord, forgive me; she's bringing out the devil in meLooking all around, you think nothing is really working The pieces never fit quite naturally It didn't come with directions, but somehow we found perfection And it all worked out just how it was meant to be Through the passion, through the fights The wrong turns we made right The one thing, one thing never changed And this too shall last When the beauty is gone and time goes by too fast The feelings, the lonely troubles don't seem to pass We got each other, it will be alright We got the love to make it through the night This too shall last Now the door is always open, never mentioned and never spoken And only we know where we like to hide the keys And no wind could have weathered, it's holding us together As long as we live in our home, yeah I believe And this too shall last When the beauty is gone and time goes by too fast The feelings, the lonely troubles don't seem to pass We got each other, it will be alright We got the love to make it through the night This too shall last This too shall lastI've sipped the finest brandy Smelled the sweetest perfume I kissed the softest lips

youth, we run into, is just an illusion A glass is always half full, till you fill it to the top I remember when you're with me, I forget it when you're not If life is a lesson, love is an action If pain is a weapon, sorrow's attraction If you got our heartbeat, you know you got me If a house is a building, home is a feeling Here come the force, spring on a porch Don't mean a damn thing, sheets on the bed, you nothing but thread, they're always empty If no one, to wake up to, to make lonely stop I remember when you're with me, I forget it when you're not If life is a lesson, if love is an action If pain is a weapon, sorrow's attraction If you got our heartbeat, you know you got me If a house is a building, home is a feeling Whoooah, stay calm and light, It's just you and I When I realise If life is a lesson, if love is an action If pain is a weapon, you're my attraction If you got our heartbeat, you know you got me If a house is a building, home is a feeling If a house is a building, home is a feelingYou're on a shadow of a dark You're someone, I can't live without Sure the sun is gonna rise, I'll be there, by your side'Cause I won't ever leave you, won't ever go I'll be the ground under your feet And I'll work for you baby Fingers to the bone Do you smile, I ain't gonna sleep'Cause without you, there's no me Now I'm the shadow of a dark I was wrong, I can see it now From the cradle to the grave Sometimes we lost, but sometimes we get saved And I won't ever leave you, won't ever go I'll be the ground under your feet And I'll work for you baby Fingers to the bone Do you smile, I ain't gonna sleep'Cause without you, there's no me
