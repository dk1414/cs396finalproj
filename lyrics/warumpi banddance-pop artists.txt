a long way south To the heart of the land is where I'm livin' now And you know I'm worn and torn For it's a long way back to the place I was born Still, I think I've finally arrived To where the desert life is a real paradise With you, I've learned to see That where a man feels at home is where he's meant to be So I'll see you out on the mulga and spinifex plain Anytime, Tjilpi, I'll be coming back this way See you out on the mulga and spinifex plain Just light me a fire and I'll soon be home again Sometimes I think, well, how can I stay here Do I really belong in this long, hot year But when the summer rains fall down You know I feel so alive, I've gotta stick around With you all of my life I've been wanting to come and be close by your side But I know it won't be long And I'll have to go back to where I started fromSix years I've been in the city And every night, I dream of the sea They say home is where you find it Will this place ever satisfy me For I come from the saltwater people We've always lived by the sea Now I'm out here west of Alice Springs With a wife and a family And my island home My island home My island home Is waitin' for me In the evening the dry wind blows From the hills And across the plain I close my eyes and I'm standing In a boat On the sea again And I'm holding that long turtle spear And I feel I'm close now To where it must be My island home, is waitin' for me For I come from the saltwater people We've always lived by the sea Now I'm out here west of Alice Springs With a wife and a family
