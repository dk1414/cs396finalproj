Coke and tin in my pocket Looking at all the lights Looking at all the lights Too many come and too many go This one moves like a rocket Where are you going, son First day for the mind Taken alive,

Something's in your locket Do you know where you're going, son First day from the girl Taken alive, must get on the side Taken alive, must get on the side Taken alive, must get on the side Taken alive, must get on the side, oh yeah Taken alive, taken aliveDid you see the monster in paradise Oh boy, he was as cool as ice You know it completely We suffered defeat, we were long Did you see

again Monster in paradise Shut your mouth, close your eyes And run, run, run, run Did you see the dark army underground Looking for the old one we found We won a dog who bit my knee There lies the penalty for stealing Did you see the man on the high trapeze Now we know how to die with ease Looking up at the master He was going much faster Than the squirrel-faced lady on the high tight wire Look
