I know you think that I shouldn't still love you Or tell you that But if I didn't say it, well, I'd still have felt it Where's the sense in that I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder Or return to where we were But I will go down with this ship And I won't put my hands up and surrender There will be no white flag above my door I'm in love and always will be I know I left too much mess and destruction To come back again And I caused nothing but trouble I understand if you can't talk to me again And if you live by the rules of "it's over"Then I'm sure that that makes sense But I will go down with this ship And I won't put my hands up and surrender There will be no white flag above my door I'm in love and always will beMy tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window And I can't see at all And even if I could, it'd all be grey But your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad It's not so bad I drank too much last night, got bills to pay My head just feels in pain I missed the bus and there'll be hell today I'm late for work again And even if I'm there, they'll all imply That I might not last the day And then you call me And it's not so bad, it's not so bad And I want to thank you For giving me the best day of my life Oh, just to be with you Is having the best day of my lifeDon’t wrap it up in gold Don’t hide it behind the sun Just give it to me as it is And let it stand Don’t fly it like a kite Between the clouds It needs no excuse Just bring it down Let eyes that are in pain look upon it In all its glory Let us move on Let us move on For this is short And it will pass Let us move on Let us move on For this is short And it will pass For every voice that is lifted In reverence and pain Show us now And let love not be chained We should feel what we can stand And let us be alive So we know That we’ve done all we can Let hearts that are frozen get to see it In all its gloryI haven't ever really found a place that I call home I never stick around quite long enough to make it I apologize that once again I'm not in love But it's not as if I mind that your heart ain't exactly breaking It's just a thought, only a thought But if my life is for rent And I don't learn to buy Well, I deserve nothing more than I get'Cause nothing I have is truly mine I've always thought that I would love to live by the sea To travel the world alone and live more simply I have no idea what's happened to that dream'Cause there's really nothing left here to stop me It's just a thought, only a thought If my life is for rent And I don't learn to buy Well, I deserve nothing more than I get'Cause nothing I have is truly mine If my life is for rent And I don't learn to buy Well, I deserve nothing more than I get'Cause nothing I have is truly mineI'm not sitting with my head in my hands right now I don't care where you've been No, I ain't watching the clock or getting my phone out I won't drink myself to sleep Oh, oh You don't, you don't get under my skin no more No, it's gone, it's gone I ain't thinking 'bout you no more I found a way to let you go So you don't have to stay now A broken mind, I came close But you can't rip my heart out I'm giving up, I'm giving up, I'll give you up I found a way to let you go It's gonna rip your heart out Got your picture covering up the cracks on the wall But the lines won't fade Didn't think that I would be missing you at all Maybe that was my mistake Oh, ohI didn't hear you leave I wonder how am I still here And I don't want to move a thing It might change my memory Oh, I am what I am I'll do what I want But I can't hide And I won't go I won't sleep And I can't breathe Until you're resting here with me And I won't leave And I can't hide I cannot be Until you're resting here with me Don't want to call my friends For they might wake me from this dream And I can't leave this bed Risk forgetting all that's beenYerimde saydım bak kalbim karıştırır

endless roads heading into the sun Big skies, bigger dreams, enough for everyone I was brave, free of love, I wanted to travel alone We were born in the light, I'm sorry I remembered it wrong I'm sorry that I broke you down I'm sorry that I thought it through I'm sorry that I looked and ran I couldn't keep up good enough You were there when I needed you A hand without a word Stood at my back when I wanted you Turned away when it hurt You were there when I called for you And then I walked away I've run so far, but you're still on my mind You're still on my mind The sun began to burn too bright I saw myself in the light I opened the door and lost the dream And couldn't go back inside I took a road that led nowhere I didn't know that then But I made my choice Now I've gone too far to come back here againI know you think that I shouldn't still love you Or tell you that But if I didn't say it, well, I'd still have felt it Where's the sense in that I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder Or return to where we were But I will go down with this ship And I won't put my hands up and surrender There will be no white flag above my door I'm in love and always will be I know
