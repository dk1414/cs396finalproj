'93 And Mr  storyteller, yes, tell us a story, please …I am on the underground sitting with a slim shot Run up in the Queensway and rob off at the King’s Cross Then escape to the Temple where the heist gets stashed Then I make a dash quick for the Knightsbridge Cross the bridge then the military surface So I make a break for the Piccadilly Circus To see a girl they employ on the tightrope In the slight hope she might know where to lie low She sent me off to the Angel on a Blackhorse Where the Mile Ends she led me to a trapdoor And then she tapped more sonnet in a skilled trend When it opened up she led me off into Willesden Through the razor sharp think it’s called bear cuts Bumped into Sloane so me and Sloane Squared up But it was unfair because Sloane had the hammer ready So I disappeared knowing that the Cannonburys I escaped with my life shackled Then I met the Black Friars who hid me in a White Chapel Then they led me to a hideout in a Lime House In a room for a week with the blinds down Then I am back on these streets that never missed us Linked Shadwell to take me to his Seven Sisters And to tell them I’ll be selling them a parcel And not to bother offering the Elephant and Castle We done the deal in the park by the Royal Oak As a Monument, we’re dealing with some loyal folk They took my word for a case full of currency Then I head south to purchase some Surrey Quays But as I left police in their war paints Jumped on me quick their sisters they’re all saints They won’t snitch on me was my first thought As I got sentenced to death up in Earl’s CourtI'm the spaceman cowboy Psychedelic psychic Paranoid schizoid Counting all my vices I'm fighting all my blessings I'm caught up in a crisis Although my sleep's deathless My days seem lifeless I scream at existence, it answers with silence I silenced the questions with outbursts of violence I'm lost in the maze where I find my reality I triumph on self defeat and beat myself gradually I drove myself mad, searching for sanity I lost my way home while exploring the galaxies I'm fueling these fires that burn my mentality My muse is abuse and a long road of tragedies I drown in the depths of my bitter self knowledge I used all my bravery trying to have courage I seek for forgiveness, but beg to be punished I fight for my freedom while chained to these gutters I find all my comforts in deep insecurities Spoil what's beautiful looking for impurities I'm buried in the lies trying to live my life truthfully I sail my ship alone and I'm still having mutinies I'm wearing a disguise hiding from the phonies I'm hiding from myself, but I'm scared of being lonely My world's like a cell God created just to hold me My life's like a game where my death is the trophyWelcome seekers, take your assigned positions and prepare for our sacred ceremony At the sound of the gong let the ritual begin The dark sky walker, blinded by the star light Spaceflight dogfight a Titan like its our type

feel no sympathy I'll handicap your whole squad, move like i'm ghost dog Careful when you nosedive, I feel I'm getting close God Close enough to melt my wings feeling like I'm Icarus Stroll through the thick of this, guarding my particulars You don't want to catch a dose I'm close enough to pull ya card I don't need no body guard, walk alone fully fledged Standing on the rotten ledge i suggest you do not push If you push me over i suggest that you should disappear This is not a threat my every words a worldly pledge Somebody will find you in a puddle of your piss and fear I am not a new design, careful if you walk the line Me alone will come and roll up you on you like a porcupine Fired up emotion, the world's like my concubine Look into my eyes and your should see the dark omensSo
