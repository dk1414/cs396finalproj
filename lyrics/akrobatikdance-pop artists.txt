technology I can't feel anything It started as the first steps towards a man’s endin’An ended up being more like Johnny Depp in Transcendence The numbness, how did I become this Will anybody learn anything from this We’ve all felt like a shell of a man But imagine a man without a shell – that’s a livin’ hell Virtual prison cell murdered my existence Or is it preserving my existence I can’t feel but this is colder than the worst December I’m like that Captain America flick, the First Avenger Mind’s intact, but yet and still it hurts to remember Where’s my home  Did it burst into embers What about my loved ones  Are they gone forever Did we take our last road trip singin’ silly songs together Who’s in charge here  Who do I talk to What kind of time portal did I walk through Somebody tell me where am I Where Ya at I black out and wake up to catastropheYeah, it's gettin' wild out here It makes me wonder how a black man could ever raise a child out here You know the old krumbsnatcha's in this land of decay So why we killin' for the crumbs when there's so much at stake We're no longer suposed to be slaves I bet Harriet Tubman will be turnin' in her grave Like remind my soul Of the time we were great before the self hate My elders all feel the same there's no bravery We're supposed to fight for freedom not just the end of slavery Are we too selfish to even bless the kids with jewels So our youth don't get played out for fools Will they get program how to behave Malcolm X must be turnin' in his grave Like remind my soul Of the time we were great before the self hate The time we were great before the self hate The time we were great Wait, we still great, but I met up with this dread, said "Peace, Respect"He said "Respect  Me not seen that around here yet Black man kill himself for limited amount of wealth And them disrespecting women so him disrespect himself"I agree for what the dread had to get off of his chest Bob Marley will be disturbed from his rest Like remind my soulYes, yes, yes Uh, yes, yes Yeah, yo, c'mon People of the world we got to have - balance You guaranteed to fall off if you lack - balance It's one essential thing that we got to have Baby you get to get, you know that we all need - balance Can't be on point if you don't have - balance You'll get caught off guard if your game lack - balance It's one essential thing that we got to have Baby you got to get, you know that We all need - balance Take a look around, what you see  Turmoil At some point recently, the whole world spoiled It seems like we all fallin But I'm here to help restore the balance, cause I'm answerin my callin And I don't think I'm better than you But let me put you on to these jewels and you can put me on too I never had no problems with a lesson I got mad problems with the world though, even my profession There's no balance in rap, you either nerd or a thug You either got too many big words or bust too many slugs You could study for years and be the world's top scholar But tryin to make the fans feel dumb, won't make 'em holla And this shit is hard to earn, so these thugs need to learn That they only fuckin it up for the kids when it's they turn Let 'em know they roots and cultivate they talent So when they reach the crossroads, they can have balance And that's why the game needs Ak Troops are at need to bring the realness back Everywhere you look now, shit is fucked up Kids goin to school, they blowin the bus up World War I II is on the brink of reality We kill the innocent and call 'em incidental casualties How do we get some balance

Early afternoon session and my homies just left All of a sudden started feeling mad stressed Like an elephant was standing on my mother fucking chest Now I start to panic and the game took in false Agitated by accelerated rates of my pulse I called up my lady like I think I'm dying, hon She said, get off the phone with me and call 911 I tried, cause shit was really faded in a hurry at this point The numbers on my phone was all blurry and shit But by the grace of god I managed to dial And told them please send somebody to my crib right now!I knew that that's the only way that I would stand a chance I'm a rider, but now I'll be riding in an ambulance!They found me face down on a pavement Probably thinking about my tombstone engravement Vague memories were begging for resistance They said they couldn't help me But we're just a short distance from a hospital Mass general, class medical facility, incredible professional abilities Next thing that I remember was my mom's voice Ain't she in V A and holding my hands My aunt Joyce, what's going on How long have I been strapped to this table I wanna speak, but the ventilator makes me not able I'm hoping that is just a nightmare But every time I open my eyes I'm right there Tools and machines everywhere, I guess they're helping me survive Well, at least I'm alive Uh, move your body like Throw your hands up Move your arms around Yep Nod your head like Yo, yo This is just another take on the age old question Where's the rappers that's prepared to rip a stage show fresh and Get the jam started based on talent and not gimmicks  It's like that across the board though, we all critics You could be white and good, but don't prep the role Cause it don't mean shit if it ain't got soul You could be a hard brother from the grittiest streets But you ain't got soul if you can't ride beats So, so, where the soul go If you got holes through your whole flow, you need to know your role bro But see I rip it like an old pro And leave my mark like rap is a wall and I'm soul glo I'm just a kid you heard about through word of mouth Who grew up in the gutter but avoided the murder route While other cats were pulling the burners out I was on the field, playin fullback, runnin a mean corner route The line of scrimmage kept me focused on a finer image Smoke a oolie  Nope, I got a fuckin rhyme to finish I got my whole life to smoke weed
