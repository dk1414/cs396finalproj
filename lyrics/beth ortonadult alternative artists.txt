You walked into my house last night I couldn't help but notice A light that was long gone still burning strong You were sitting, your fingers like fuses Your eyes were cinnamon You said you stand for every known abuse That was ever threatened to anyone but you And why should I know better by now When I'm old enough not to While every line speaks the language of love It never held the meaning I was thinking of And I can't decide over right or wrong I guess sometimes you need the place where you belong Some may sing the wrong words to the wrong melody It's little things like this that matter to me Others feel that you should stand For every known abuse to hand And all the things that they could never seeStayed true to the things I knew when I was younger And food and love was all but left to hunger'Cause when I stray from my truth as I grow older Too much leaves an empty hollow hunger I think about you on a moonlit night And the stars all seem to weep When there's so much love to lose There's never any time for sleep Look at me doing all these things without you We always laughed and you were untrue Where was it we tried hard not to go to I think that's how I finally came through All the things we took for granted The words still live on in my head All the times I took for granted All the words I never said I think about you in the moonlit night And the stars all seem to weep When there's so much love to give There's never any time for sleep, yeahSo much stays unknown till the time has come Did you imagine you could ever be so strong Then watch your fear just turn into relief Your sea of doubt become your own belief Though tears don't come to cry some grief away The tears will help to keep your need at bay So come on now, come on now, child You're here just a while Come on now, come on now, child You're here just a while A mother told me just before she died My mother told me just before she died"Oh darling, darling, don't you be like me You will fall in love with the very first man you meet"But mother, mother, some will never know The love that you have is still holding my soul So come on now, come on now, child You're here just a little while Come on now, come on now, child You're here just a whileWhen the devil comes blowing through your door You'll know there's trouble and he's coming back for more You better keep what is precious hidden under the floor Or you better treat it so good, it will never want for more But looking back in retrospect Did you ever really get what you'd expect Trying to rectify Got lost a little further You've been trying to justify Find out how and where it came The devil was your angel, but it's not no more The devil was your angel when you weren't sure Do I tempt trouble to break through all these doors Just to put a face to the voice which always home To fight for what is precious, to know what's under the floor If I could treat it so good, I swear I'd never want for more But when I found my peace, there was still mistakes However painfully aware in every step I take Trying to rectify Got lost a little further Well, I've been trying to justify Find out how and where it cameYou lose it just to find it And as you walk right by it You forget how you got there And why you never meant to stay And I won't watch you waste away And I won't fake another day And if one truth leads you to five I still don't believe in your reasons why I just don't believe in why You love her, you need her To feel is to believe her You know it, you want it You just can't believe you've got it And I can't watch you waste away And I won't beg you still to stay And if one truth leads you to five I still don't believe in your reasons why I just don't believe in why Just don't believe in whyTired, but I ain't sleepin'Thinking about some sad affair And why I should be leavin''Cause some of these thoughts Only seem to take me out of here Yeah, these habits are so hard to break They're the most easy to make These habits are so hard to break And the most easy to make Thinking about tomorrow Tired from all the time I spared On what I still believe in When none of my talk Ever seems to get me anywhere Yeah, these habits are so hard to break Are the most easy to make These habits are so hard to break Are the most easy to make So easy to make So long Night-night friends, so long So long Will it ever happen again You know that I've been waiting for you I've been created for you So long You know that I've been fading from you Nothing could save me from you So longShe weaves secrets in her hair The whispers are not hers to share She's deep as a well She's deep as a well Another day wastes away And my heart sinks with the sun A new day's dawning And a new day has not yet begun So, anyway There I was Just sitting on your porch Drinking in your sweetest decline Your sweetest decline What's the use in regrets They're just things we haven't done yet What are regrets They're just lessons we haven't learned yet Another day draws away And my heart sinks with the sun It's like catching snow on my tongue It's like catching snow on my tongueHave you ever seen a sign That upon a lifetime There were angels You won't lose track'Cause upon their backs Feel the weight of wings Why'd they fall  It's hard to tell But some things you can buy yourself Yeah, we only hurt the ones we love While we don't need a reason Only care for the thing we deserve And that's something to believe in I think I've seen a sign But it's a very fine line If you want it all And don't lose track Upon my back There's no weight of wings When they shine, it's hard to say But some things never fade away And we only hurt the ones we love While we don't need a reason Only care for the thing we deserve Like something to believe inIf I ever feel the light again Shining down on me I don't have to tell you How welcome it would be I felt the light before But I let it slip away An' I just keep on believing That it'll come back someday It's not the spotlight It's not the candlelight Its not the streetlights Or some old street of dreams It ain't the moonlight Not even the sunlight But I've seen it shining in your eyes And you know what I mean Sometimes I try to tell myself The light was never real Just a fantasy that used to be The way I used to feel But you and I know better Even though it's been so long Now if your memory really serves you well You'll never tell me no wrongI wanna sit and talk and laugh with you as the day ends I wanna see your smiling face before the new day begins You'll never know what it means to see the sunlight in your hair And dancing everywhere I wanna shout about it But I keep quiet about it I wanna laugh about it But I don't joke about it I wanna live without it But I can't do without it I'm someone's daughter, are you somebody's son Can I ease your pain till the morning comes I'm no one's daughter, I belong to the sun Gonna ease your pain till the morning comes Keep looking for the reason high and low to let it go Keep losing my mind looking for the peace that I'll never find I wanna know how it feels to be the sunlight in your hair And dancing everywhere I wanna shout about it But I keep quiet about it I wanna laugh about it But I don't joke about it I wanna live without it But I can't do without it
