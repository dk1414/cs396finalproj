All my friends are heathens, take it slow Wait for them to ask you who you know Please don't make any sudden moves You don't know the half of the abuse All my friends are heathens, take it slow Wait for them to ask you who you know Please don't make any sudden moves You don't know the half of the abuse Welcome to the room of people who have rooms of people That they loved one day, locked away Just because we check the guns at the door Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades You'll never know the psychopath sitting next to you You'll never know  the murderer sitting next to you You'll think, "How'd I get here, sitting next to you "But after all I've said, please don't forget All my friends are heathens, take it slow Wait for them to ask you who you know Please don't make any sudden moves You don't know the half of the abuseI wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words I wish I found some chords in an order that is new I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think My name's Blurryface and I care what you think My name's Blurryface and I care what you think Wish we could turn back time to the good old days When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out Wish we could turn back time  to the good old days When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out We're stressed out Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latterI just wanna stay in the sun where I find I know it's hard sometimes Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind I know it's hard sometimes Yeah, I think about the end just way too much But it's fun to fantasize On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was But it's fun to fantasize Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'So I'm takin' my time on my ride Takin' my time on my ride"I'd die for you," that's easy to say We have a list of people that we would take A bullet for them, a bullet for you A bullet for everybody in this room But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through See many bullets comin' through Metaphorically, I'm the man But literally, I don't know what I'd do"I'd live for you," and that's hard to do Even harder to say when you know it's not true Even harder to write when you know that tonight There were people back home who tried talking to you But then you ignore them still All these questions they're for real Like "Who would you live for " "Who would you die for "And "Would you ever kill "So where are ya It's been a little while Sippin' on straight chlorine Let the vibe slide over me This beat is a

something great My lungs will fill and then deflate They fill with fire, exhale desire I know it's dire, my time today I have these thoughts so often, I ought To replace that slot with what I once bought'Cause somebody stole my car radio And now I just sit in silence Sometimes quiet is violent I find it hard to hide it, my pride is no longer inside It's on my sleeve, my skin will scream Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream I hate this car that I'm driving, there's no hiding for me I'm forced to deal with what I feel There is no distraction to mask what is real I could pull the steering wheel I have these thoughts so often, I ought To replace that slot with what I once bought'Cause somebody stole my car radio And now I just sit in silenceThere's an infestation in my

different cries For "if" is purely panic and "when" is solemn sorrow And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow We're surrounded and we're hounded There's no above, or under, or around it For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see For if and when we go above, the question still remains Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder But until that time, I'll try to sing this If I keep moving, they won't know I'll morph to someone else What they throw at me's too slow I'll morph to someone else I'm just a ghost I'll morph to someone else A defense mechanism mode
