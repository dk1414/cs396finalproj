Spend all your time waiting For that second chance For a break that would make it okay There's always some reason To feel not good enough And it's hard at the end of the day I need some distraction Oh, beautiful release Memories seep from my veins Let me be empty Oh, and weightless and maybe I'll find some peace tonight In the arms of the angel Fly away from here From this dark, cold hotel room And the endlessness that you fear You are pulled from the wreckage Of your silent reverie You're in the arms of the angel May you find some comfort here So tired of the straight line And everywhere you turn There's vultures and thieves at your back The storm keeps on twisting You keep on building the lies That you make up for all that you lack It don't make no difference Escaping one last time It's easier to believe in this sweet madness Oh, this glorious sadness that brings me to my kneesWhen somebody loved me, everything was beautiful Every hour we spent together lives within my heart And when she was sad, I was there to dry her tears And when she was happy, so was I When she loved me Through the summer and the fall, we had each other, that was all Just she and I together, like it was meant to be And when she was lonely, I was there to comfort her And I knew that she loved me So the years went by, I stayed the same But she began to drift away, I was left alone Still, I waited for the day when she'd say, "I will always love you"Lonely and forgotten, never thought she'd look my way And she smiled at me and held me just like she used to do Like she loved me, when she loved me When somebody loved me, everything was beautiful Every hour we spent together lives within my heart When she loved meSpend all your time waiting For that second chance For a break that would make it okay There's always some reason To feel not good enough And it's hard at the end of the day I need some distraction Or a beautiful release Memories seep from my veins Let me be empty Oh and weightless and maybe I'll find some peace tonight In the arms of the angel Fly away from here From this dark cold hotel room And the endlessness that you fear You are pulled from the wreckage Of your silent reverie You're in the arms of the angel May you find some comfort here So tired of the straight line And everywhere you turn There's vultures and thieves at your backI will remember you Will you remember me Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories Remember the good times that we had I let them slip away from us when things got bad How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun Wanna feel your warmth upon me I wanna be the one I will remember you Will you remember me Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories I'm so tired, but I can't sleep Standin' on the edge of something much too deep It's funny how we feel so much, but we cannot say a word We are screaming inside, oh, we can't be heard That I will remember you Will you remember me  Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memoriesAdia, I do believe I failed you Adia, I know I've let you down Don't you know I tried so hard To love you in my way It's easy, let it go Adia I'm empty since you left me Trying to find a way to carry on I search myself and everyone To see where we went wrong There's no one left to finger There's no one here to blame There's no one left to talk to, honey And there ain't no one to buy our innocence Cause we are born innocent Believe me Adia We are still innocent It's easy, we all falter Does it matter You come out at night That's when the energy comes And the dark side's light And the vampires roam You strut your rasta wear And your suicide poem And a cross from a faith That died before Jesus came You're building a mystery You live in a church Where you sleep with voodoo dolls And you won't give up the search For the ghosts in the halls You wear sandals in the snow And a smile that won't wash away Can you look out the window Without your shadow getting in the way Oh, you're so beautiful With an edge and a charm But so careful When I'm in your arms'Cause you're working Building a mystery Holding on and holding it in Yeah, you're working Building a mystery And choosing so carefullyIt doesn't mean much It doesn't mean anything at all The life I've left behind me Is a cold room I've crossed the last line From where I can't return Where every step I took in faith betrayed me And led me from My home Sweet surrender Is all that I have to give Take me in No questions asked You strip away the ugliness That surrounds me Are you an angel Am I already that gone I only hope that I won't disappoint you When I'm down here on My kneesListen as the wind blows From across the great divide Voices trapped in yearning Memories trapped in time The night is my companion And solitude my guide Would I spend forever here And not be satisfied And I would be the one To hold you down Kiss you so hard I'll take your breath away And after I Wipe away the tears Just close your eyes dear Through this world I stumble So many times betrayed Trying to find an honest word To find the truth enslavedHeaven bend to take my hand And lead me through the fire Be the long awaited answer To a long and painful fight Truth be told, I've tried my best But somewhere 'long the way I got caught up in all there was to offer And the cost was so much more than I could bear Though I've tried I've fallen, I have sunk so low I messed up Better, I should know So don't come 'round here And tell me "I told you so"We all begin with good intent When love was raw and young We believe that we can change ourselves The past can be undone But we carry on our back the burden time always reveals In the lonely light of morning In the wound that would not heal It's the bitter taste of losing everything That I've held so dearHearts are worn in these dark ages You're not alone in this story's pages The light has fallen amongst the living and the dying And I'll try to hold it in, yeah, I'll try to hold it in The world's on fire, it's more than I can handle Tap into the water, try to bring my share Try to bring more, more than I can handle Bring it to the table, bring what I am able I watch the heavens but I find no calling Something I can do to change what's coming Stay close to me while the sky is falling I don't wanna be left alone, don't wanna be alone The world's on fire, it's more than I can handle Tap into the water, try to bring my share Try to bring more, more than I can handle Bring it to the table, bring what I am able Hearts break, hearts mend Love still hurts Visions clash, planes crash Still there's talk of Saving souls, still the cold Is closing in on us
