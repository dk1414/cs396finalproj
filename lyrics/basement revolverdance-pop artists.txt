Just another day today Rolling down the mountain I remember yesterday Like it was tomorrow Words are just words, and words are words Words are just words, and words are words Days go on and seasons change Though my feet don't move they stay the same I know that I can't replace The snow and the leaves To the trees and the sky To the rain Words are just words, and words are words Words are just words, and words are words Words are just words, and words are words Words are just words, and words are words Words are just words, and words are words Words are just words, and words are words Words are just words, and words are wordsWhen I'm overwhelmed I go to bed Theres a giant cloud that sits above my head Maybe I'll sleep it all away Close my eyes so life brings a new day Baby I'm so sorry I'm trying my best to figure this out I swear that I'm so happy Cause crying won't fix what's already broken and dead Just give me some time Give me some time All of this comes down to me and you Forget all things that she put you through Do you feel the same way Close my eyes, still life brings a new day Baby I'm so sorry I'm trying my best to figure this out I swear that I'm so happy Cause crying won't fix what's already broken and dead Just give me some time Dancing lights On the northern sky Like memories passing by Cradled by the shoreline We were young then Probably six years old Just my sister in the cold Chills passing through my bones These days are numbered So don't waste them on slumber Yeah, these days are numbered So don't waste them on slumber Now short are my days So I shifted my gaze To the lights of the city Smokestacks never looked so pretty I've been climbing high mountains Been carrying a load Many move to the oil Though I know I'm not aloneNight time drives In the city, with my guy In the front seat See my love sitting pretty Love love Shake the dust I wanna go dancing Loose these chains And take me dancing I wanna go dancing Oh shake the dust And take me dancing Forest now Take me swimming With my love No corporate living See me wild Wild wild Shake the dust I wanna go dancing Loose these chains And take me dancing I wanna go dancing Oh shake the dust And take me dancingI get it, You're sad.He dropped the ball,no longer in your court.Try not to feel bad,but you tried to do the same thing to me.I don't want to be mad,but your bodies sticks together in my mind I hope you feel bad,i hope that it was good for you.Please just stay away from Johnny,cause i love him, understand.I don't need your presence sitting on my chest, above my hands.It's a really bad time right now.It's a really bad time right now.It's a really bad time right now.It's a really bad-- really bad...My friends all tell me,to hope for the best, but i feel the worst.I try to get sleep,but my body won't stop shaking.I'm blue eyed.Don't think i'm ready,for the consequences of your actions.Feel stupid and we with our own to trust Night time drives In the city, with my guy In the front seat See my love sitting pretty Love love Shake the dust I wanna go dancing Loose these chains And take me dancing I wanna go dancing Oh shake the dust And take me dancing Forest now Take me swimming With my love No corporate living See me wild Wild wild Shake the dust I wanna go dancing Loose these chains And take me dancing I wanna go dancing Oh shake the dust And take me dancingThis winter felt the longest That it's ever been;Kept some smoke in my nose to Keep me going And I swore that I'd never Go back to my sins But hard times got me down Left me jonesin'I said, maybe if I try To drink a little wine;Break some bread, like your body;Feel better I confess to not needing you And doing it my own But my weakness has always Taught better I've been waiting to meet someone like you Feels like so long my heart's been all tied into knots So I'll pray to become the best version of me Because lately my head's got me down Flower my head with a crownReally starting to feel,like i need someone to talk to.Every time i break,it falls out from my boat.Peel back the bark,i swear i won't bite.Really tired of this fight,really tired of this fiiiiight.Fiiiiight.Climb into my lungs,there you'll find smoke rings like tree trunks.and look in through the inhales and the exhales.Try not to believe, this sacred land.Really starting to feel,like i'm going to go crazy.Every time the wind blows,it rushes through my veins.I'll lose my leaves, like there you left me.Really tired of your clothes.Really tired of your clothes Cloooothes.Climb into my lungs,there you'll find smoke rings like tree trunks,and do it again.Through the inhales and the exhales.Try not to believe.You should take my hand,climb into my lungs.There you'll find smoke rings like tree trunks,and do it again.Through the inhales and exhales.Try not to believe, this sacred land Sunday drives downtown,i got to get even Time to change all my clothes,time to put up my hair You say you still love me,but you cant do this no more.You say you still love me,but you cant do this anymore.My door will always be,always be open to you.My door will always be,always be open to you.Ouuuuuuuuuuu ou ouuuuu Ouuuuuuuuuuu ou ouuuu Johnny's gone for a week,and he's still getting back i see.I'll do what it takes,i'll make myself fade away.My door will always be,always be open to you.My door will always be,always be open to you Just another day today Rolling down the mountain I remember yesterday Like it was tomorrow Words are just words, and words are words Words are just
