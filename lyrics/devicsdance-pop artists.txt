I'm not saying that I felt like you cared I'm not saying that I want to go back The salty seas behind the eye And it's the tears that come and make me cry The falling leaf that never tries To hold on to what keeps it alive I was so green nothing could touch me I'm not saying that This is good or bad I'm not saying that I want to go The salty seas behind the eye And it's the tears that come and make me cry The falling leaf that never tries To hold on to what keeps it alive The summer dream behind the eye And it's the sleep that makes me alive The sudden ease when you arrive And it's you That makes me tryStreams of streets that seem to change you But you know they'll always find you Know one ever really knows you in light of the heart that beats over your head Until you listen to it Until you run right to it There's no right way to do it It's the light of the heart that beats over your head Turn up the stereo I can't hear when you talk so loud I want to go wherever it goes I want to be there in the red red red red morning You found places to stimulate you but you know they'll never change you You could run forever and find that the heart still beats over your head Turn up the stereo I can't hear when you talk so loud I want to go wherever it goes I want to be there in the red red morningHeaven please i have fallen On my knees and out of your arms Take me back i am good now Heaven please i have given Everything to sing for you Give some back Love now What's the game please stop pretending That you don't hear me Heaven please come down and save me And bring that man to me Heaven please i've been walking Gates whose entrance i am denied Let me in let me in now Heaven sweet i am calling At your feet i been true to you Paid my due's say i'm through now La la la la la.. Something has to change Something has to give I could re-arrange my mind And what i did If i were to choose Either way i loose I could be alone Or be alone with you Empty space To fill an empty place Everything i see Is meaningless to me If it's how you feel than it's real Was i wrong to just go on and on You never knew that i was gone What does that say of me You never thought that i Only needed you Just for a little while Empty space To fill an empty place Everything i see Is meaningless to me You make me tired Life wants to live You just want to watch itSomeday he'll come along The man I love And he'll be big and strong The man I love And when he comes my way I'll do my best to make him stay He'll look at me and smile I'll understand And in a little while He'll take my hand And though it seems absurd I know we both won't say a word Maybe I will meet him Sunday Maybe Monday, maybe not Still, I'm sure to meet him one day Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day We'll build a little home Just meant for two From which I'll never roam Who would, would you And so all else above I'm dreaming of The man I loveYou were born with a heart that can never be filled And a head like snow that can never be still There are streets paved in gold that shine so bright That you force yourself to look away If we can't see now, we might never see We only kill ourselves more slowly If you can't find love, then you will finally see How we kill ourselves slowly The words that fall from your mouth They crystalize and break on the ground And everything you want, you don't have But you force yourself to look away If we can't see now, we might never see We only kill ourselves more slowly If you can't find love, then you will finally see How we kill ourselves more slowly If you can't find me, then you can't find love If you close your eyes then will finally see That you're already here with meI had to taste to see it close But you're already there Right next to me How could you ever find A better place to be You're breathing slowly I let you hold me I left you so many times While you were next to me Your brown hair on the bed I wanted you to see This is a song For a silent sleeping girl She wants nothing But to wake and find you there The words you whisper They fade in morning Then I look at her And her sleeping face Her foot resting in mine And then I know my place This is a song For a silent sleeping girl She wants nothing But to wake and find you there You thereOn a hot summer wind that the night had blown in A vision a siren in black With green velvet eyes and a porcelain smile The fireflies danced in her hair She said "please can you help me I'm lost and i've nowhere to go Please can you be the kindest soul "Well i couldn't resist her undauntable charm As she brushed passed me through the door There was something inside burned i just couldn't hide I'd never seen beauty before"please can i stay, for my body is weak to the bone And can you tell me are we alone "Heaven is only one kiss away And i can take you as long as we stay Well, the first lie i told was my wife Had been gone one year ago to this day And i still hear her cries in the trembling night And the nightmares just won't go away"please come close and look deep in my eyes"And i watched them turn black as night Heaven is only one kiss away And i can take you as long as we stay Heaven is only one kiss away Hells here on earth boy so drink for todayLonely nights like an endless spire They don't take me higher They just bring me down Frozen heart maybe i could love you If you feel the coldness You could sit by me Please don't go stay and close the door Stretch the night out forget tomorrow It was bright till he brought the darkness When i saw him pass without a single word Fragile heart and i tried to love him But i couldn't love him Maybe i can't love So my friend can't we just pretend Live the moment forget our sorrows It's the sound and the words your mouth make All the stories you fake and they're just for me It's your heart and the way i see you And the way you see me Maybe we could love Please don't go stay and close the door Live the moment forget tomorrowWhat did you mean'there's too many angels here'Is it the sweet ones that keep you here Or did you mean that everyone you love Is already gone, too early Whatever you mean I came to mine and realized That it's all fake But I love to dream And to feel everything Come up, come up It's so hard to love when you know how it goes Come up, come up Waves of pleasure, waves of control And the waves run their course Turn into foam They start with a roar and then it's back home Come up It's at the shows I feel so alive And otherwise There's a craving so bright Well my friend with not many words But it's just as well, cause what are they for You see through me you make me quiet You know all the words so why should I hide it
