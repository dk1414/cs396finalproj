The Devil went down to Georgia He was lookin' for a soul to steal He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind He was willing to make a deal When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said "Boy, let me tell you what.""I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you."The boy said, "My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin But I'll take your bet, and you're gonna regret, 'cause I'm the best there's ever been."Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold But if you lose the devil gets your soul The Devil opened up his case and he said, "I'll start this show."And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this:I was taking a trip out to L.A.​Tooling along in my Chevrolet Tokin’ on a number and diggin' on the radio Just as I crossed the Mississippi line I heard that highway start to whine And I knew that left rear tire was about to go Well the spare was flat and I got uptight'Cause there wasn't a filling station in sight So I just limped on down the shoulder on the rim I went as far as I could, and when I stopped the car It was right in front of this little bar Kind of a redneck-lookin' joint called the Dew Drop Inn Well, I stuffed my hair up under my hat And told the bartender that I had a flat And would he be kind enough to give me change for a one There was one thing I was sure proud to see There wasn't a soul in the place except for him and me He just looked disgusted and pointed toward the telephone I called up a station down the road a ways And he said he wasn't very busy today And he could have someone there in just about 10 minutes or so He said, "Now, you just stay right where yer at!"And I didn't bother to tell the darn fool That I sure as hell didn't have anyplace else to go I just ordered up a beer and sat down at the bar When some guy walked in and said, "Who owns this car With the peace sign, and the mag wheels, and four on the floor "Well, he looked at me and I damn near died And I decided that I'd just wait outside So I laid a dollar on the bar and headed for the door Just when I thought I'd get out of there with my skin These five big dudes come strollin' in With this one old drunk chick and some fella with green teeth And I was almost to the door, when the biggest one Said, "You tip your hat to this lady son!"And when I did, all that hair fell out from underneath Now the last thing I wanted was to get into a fight In Jackson Mississippi on a Saturday night Especially when there was three of them and only one of me But they all started laughing, and I felt kinda sick And I knew I better think of something pretty quick So I just reached out and kicked ol' green teeth right in the knee Now he let out a yell that'd curl your hair But before he could move I grabbed me a chair And said, "Watch him folks 'cause he's a thoroughly dangerous man!""You may not know it but this man is a spy He's a undercover agent for the F BI And he's been sent down here to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan!"He was still bent over holding on to his knee But everybody else was looking and listening to me And I laid it on thicker and heavier as I went I said, "Would you believe this man has gone as far As tearing Wallace stickers off the bumpers of cars And he voted for George Mc Govern for President""Well, he's a friend of them long haired hippy-type, pinko fags!I bet you he's even got a commie flag Tacked up on the wall inside of his garage""He's a snake in the grass, I tell you guys He may look dumb but that's just a disguise He's a mastermind in the ways of espionage"They all started looking real suspicious at him And he jumped up and said, "Now just wait a minute Jim!You know he's lying, I been living here all of my life!""I'm a faithful follower of Brother John Birch And I belong to the Antioch Baptist Church And I ain't even got a garage, you can call home and ask my wife!"Then he started saying something 'bout the way I was dressed But I didn't wait around to hear the rest I was too busy moving and hoping I didn't run out of luck And when I hit the ground I was making tracks And they were just taking my car down off the jacks So I threw the man a twenty and jumped in and fired that mother up Mario Andretti would have be sure been proud Of the way I was moving when I passed that crowd Coming out the door and headed toward me in a trot And I guess I should've gone ahead and run But somehow I just couldn't resist the fun Of chasing them all just once around the parking lot Well, they headed for their car, but I hit the gas And spun around and headed them off at the pass I was slinging gravel and putting a ton of dust in the air I had them all out there stepping and fetching Like their heads were on fire and their asses was catching But I figured I had better go ahead and split before the cops got there When I hit the road I was really wheeling Had gravel flying and rubber squealing And I didn't slow down 'til I was almost to Arkansas Well, I think I'm going to reroute my trip I wonder if anybody'd think I'd flipped If I went to L.A  via OmahaI ain't nothin' but a simple man They call me a redneck I reckon that I am But there's things goin' on that make me mad down to the core I have to work like a dog to make ends meet There's crooked politicians and crime in the street And I'm madder than hell, and I ain't a-gonna take it no more We tell our kids, "Just say no"And then some panty-waist judge lets a drug dealer go He slaps him on the wrist and he turns him back out on the town But if I had my way with people sellin' dope Take a big tall tree and a short piece of rope I'd hang 'em up high and let 'em swing 'til the sun goes down Well, you know what's wrong with the world today People done gone and put their Bibles away They're livin' by the law of the jungle not the law of the land Well, the Good Book says it so I know it's the truth An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth You better watch where you go and remember where you been That's the way I see it, I'm a simple man Now I'm the kinda man wouldn't harm a mouse But if I catch somebody breakin' in my house I got twelve-gauge shotgun waitin' on the other side So don't go pushin' me against my will I don't want to have to fight you but I dern sure will If you don't want trouble then you'd better just pass me on byIf you ever go back into Wooley Swamp son you better not go at night There's things out there in the middle of them woods That'd make a strong man die from fright There's things that crawl and things that fly And things that creep around on the ground And they say the ghost of Lucius Clay gets up and it walks around But I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself And I couldn't conceive it, I never would listen to nobody else No I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself That there's some things in this world you just can't explain The old man lived in the Wooley Swamp way back in the gurgling woods And he never did do a lot of harm in the world But he never did do no good People didn't think too much of him They all thought he acted funny The old man didn't care about people anyway All he cared about was his money He'd stuff it all down into Mason jars and bury it all around And on certain nights if the moon was right He'd dig it up out of the ground He'd pour it all out on the floor of his shack And run his fingers through it Yeah, Lucius Clay was a greedy old man And that's all there ever was to itMe and my buddy got us a wild hair And figured we wanted to go somewhere So we loaded up in my ragtop Chevrolet We had a little bit of money and a whole lot of show And with Hank Jr  blarin' on the radio We got us a tank full of gas and we was on our way We figured we'd go down to New Orleans We were barrelin' down old 17 When a man with a blinking red light was on our tail He said you were doing sixty in a fourty-five But I'm gonna let you go this time But if I catch you again, I'm gonna slap you in the county jail We said "Thank you, sir, you sure been nice And you ain't gonna have to tell us twice"And we were southbound and down with the wind blowin' in our faces We kept on rolling, and pretty soon The radio was cookin' out a Haggard tune And we were pullin' into Houston and checkin' out all them places I was feelin' dry and I said "I think we ought to stop and get ourselves a drink"And old Jim said "Yeah, 'cause we got time to kill"We kept on rollin' and I seen this spot And we pulled into the parking lot Of this place called the "Cloud Nine Bar and Grill"We walked through the door, and the place was jammed The lights were low, they had a punk rock band And some orange haired fella singin' about suicide I said "Jim, this ain't our kind of place"He said "Well, let's just have one round anyway"So against my better judgement we walked on inside Went up to the bar and we sat down This fella walked up and said "I'll buy this round"And he sat down on the bar stool next to Jim He looked like a girl, but he talked like a guy He had lipstick on and mascara in his eyes And everybody in that place looked just about like him I said "Jim, this ain't our kind of bar"Let's just go on out and get back in the car'Cause there's gonna be trouble Ain't no sense in taking a chance We was gettin' up, gettin' ready to leave Somebody grabbed old Jim by the sleeve Was this good looking girl, she was asking my buddy to dance I said "Jim, don't do it, there's somethin' missin'"There's fellas dancin' and fellas kissin'There's a fella in high-heeled shoes wearin' panty hose He said "Partner, I just can't turn this down You just go over there and have one more round I'll dance with the lady, and we'll get on down the road"So he walked away and left me alone And this funny looking fella kept comin' on And he was makin' me mad with some of the things he said And then he put his hand on my knee I said "If you don't get your paw off me I'm gonna locate your nose around on the side of your head"He said "I love it when you get that fire in your eye"I said "Well, partner, try this on for size"And I unloaded on him and he went out like a light Everybody in that place must have been his friend They all headed for me, I said "This is the end"But where I come from we don't give up without a fight They were screamin' and yellin' and scratchin' and clawin'I was punchin' and hittin' and kickin' and pawin'I was holdin' my own 'cause I've been in a scrap or two Old Jim come runnin' up out of the blue And that gal he was with come runnin' up too And proceeded to beat on me with a high heel shoe I grabbed her by the hair, it come off in my hand And that beautiful girl was just a beautiful man Old Jim just got sick right there on the floor He dropped that dude like a shot from a gun Smeared his lipstick, made his makeup run And me and old Jim started fightin' our way to the door Man, we lit out of there in that Chevrolet And I put in on the floor and she stayed that way We was goin' down the highway doing 'bout a hundred and ten We was headed for home and we was gettin' nearer Then a red light came on the rear-view mirror And that same blame cop was pullin' us over again Well, I'm sittin' here in this county jail I had to call my daddy to go our bail But I learned me a lesson that I never will forget again I done give up drinking, I've give up bars And runnin' around the country in souped up cars I'm goin' back where the women are women and the men are menWhat this world needs is a few more rednecks Some people ain't afraid to take a stand What this world needs is a little more respect For the Lord and the law and the working man We could use a little peace and satisfaction Some good people up front to take the lead A little less talk and a little more action And a few more rednecks is what we need I was raised on beans and cornbread And I like my chicken fried Yes, I drive a pick-up truck And I'm full of American pride I keep a Bible on my table I got a flag out on my lawn And I don't believe in minding No one's business but my own And I love them Rambo movies I think they make a lot of sense And it's a shame old John Wayne Didn't live to run for president And I don't care what nobody says I don't trust old Gorbachev And I don't know who turned him on But it's time to turn him offPeople say I'm no good And crazy as a loon'Cause I get stoned in the mornin'I get drunk in the afternoon Kinda like my old blue tick hound I like to lay around in the shade And I ain't got no money But I damn sure got it made'Cause I ain't askin' nobody for nothin'If I can't get it on my own If you don't like the way I'm livin'You just leave this long haired country boy alone Preacher man talkin' on T VPuttin' down the rock and roll Wants me to send a donation'Cause he's worried about my soul He said, "Jesus walked on the water."And I know that it's true But sometimes I think that preacher man Would like to do a little walkin' tooGot on a plane in 'Frisco And got off in Vietnam I walked into a different world The past forever gone I could have gone to Canada Or I could have stayed in school But I was brought up differently I couldn't break the rules Thirteen months and fifteen days The last ones were the worst One minute I'd kneel down and pray And the next I'd stand and curse No place to run to Where I did not feel that war When I got home I stayed alone And checked behind each door Because I'm still in Saigon Still in Saigon I am still in Saigon In my mind The ground at home was covered in snow And I was covered in sweat My younger brother calls me a killer And my daddy calls me a vet Everybody says I'm someone else And I'm sick and there's no cure Damned if I know who I am There was only one place I was sureSitting on a barstool acting like a darn fool That's what I'm a-doing today Sitting here
