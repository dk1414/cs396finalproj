I blame you for the moonlit sky And the dream that died With the Eagle's flight I blame you for the moonlit nights When I wonder why Are the seas still dry Don't blame this sleeping satellite Did we fly to the Moon too soon Did we squander the chance In the rush of the race The reason we chase is lost in romance And still we try To justify the waste For a taste of man's greatest adventure, woah I blame you for the moonlit sky And the dream that died With the Eagle's flight I blame you for the moonlit nights When I wonder why Are the seas still dry Don't blame this sleeping satelliteThe light is fading from my room As night time comes around too soon I'm so afraid Swollen eyes portray my pain As tears fall like the summer rain I'm so alone Son of a bitch you broke my heart I need a little loving To take away the pain How could you let me down When I'm in your care I pull the covers to myself Drink and smoke upon his breath I close my eyes Again i pray to God above What have i done to lose his love Am i to blame Son of a bitch you broke my heart I need a little loving To take away the pain How could you let me down When I'm in your care Ooh somebody's daughter Give me room to breathe There are times when I feel I could drown without water Give me time to see Just one dream that is mine I feel the wind and the water I see the sun and the rain Forgive the sins of your daughter And she will pray for you I'm breaking the frame Each day's the same You should be somebody's daughter Day after day Of feeling this way You should be somebody's daughter Please say I can leave Try to ease this pain that I feel may be killing me Free me from a life That is cold, that is mine I am the dutiful lover I am the perfect mother Forgive the sins of others But please don't pray for meHere’s a man whose voice speaks for everyone And whose actions touch the lives of us all He rose with energy and style Touch my hand, kiss my child Sway us all with his smile He readily accepts acclaim But soon forgets that he came From the back streets like them We pray to the east We pray to the west And we see the gods of the new church As they undertake a vow Tell me who can save us now Save us from the lords of the new church Don't say no Here’s a man some believe he’s a visionary Here’s a man who is driven by greed He made a fortune overnight In a deal that he knew Was too good to be true Now as he bends the rules of play Becomes obsessed with the game Has to go all the wayArienne I realise something's not in your favour Arienne I'll catch you when you fall You turn to the world The world turns grey All alone On your own You're set in your ways You breathe in a smile Then wipe it away Broken heart Torn apart And let down again Arienne I realise something's not in your favour Arienne I'll catch you when you fall Arienne The view from the hill Is not what it seems From below Don't you know It's all in your dreamsI blame you for the moonlit sky And the dream that died With the Eagle's flight I blame you for the moonlit nights When I wonder why Are the seas still dry Don't blame this sleeping satellite Did we fly to the moon too soon Did we squander the chance In the rush of the race The reason we chase is lost in romance And still we try To justify the waste For a taste of man's greatest adventure I blame you for the moonlit sky And the dream that died With the Eagle's flight I blame you for the moonlit nights When I wonder why Are the seas still dry Don't blame this sleeping satellite Have we lost what it takes to advance Have we peaked too soon If the world is so green Then why does it scream under a blue moon We wonder why If the earth's sacrificed For the price of it's greatest treasureYou've got no reasons for the things you said But you can't keep your feelings to yourself And I can't find an answer to this emptiness No I can't find an answer And I wish that I was dead I never dreamt I'd hear your echo pounding in my head And though the tears have dried I'm ripped inside I'll say I'm feeling fine But what's the use When nothing could be further from the truth Oh where will I find comfort Strength to live again If there's a God above then show me how the story ends If there's a God above then how could he desert a friend Because I feel so tired And ripped inside And though the tears have dried I'm ripped inside You'll ache for me when your hands are tied You'll wish you lived in another time And if you're thinking the pain subsides There's no place to hide When you're ripped insideThe higher you climb The further you fall And the harder you try The louder they cry I don't know why But it's written in my hand And I can see what is right If I stay on track I read the news today A land was blown away I understand it's out of my hands But I would lay my life down for you If you'd guarantee That you and all your kind would not abuse it I'm scared to watch tv Because of what it does to me It leaves me feeling helpless But I would sacrifice the things I hold so dear in life If you would tell me it would not be useless And when I sleep at night Another nation rise To carry on the fight for freedom They dedicate their lives A supreme sacrifice For simple human rights and freedomI blame you for the moonlit sky And the dream that died With the eagles flight I blame you for the moonlit nights When I wonder why Are the seas still dry Don't blame this sleeping satellite Did we fly to the moon too soon Did we squander the chance In the rush of the race The reason we chase is lost in romance And still we try To justify the waste For a taste of man's greatest adventure I blame you for the moonlit sky And the dream that died With the eagles flight I blame you for the moonlit nights When I wonder why Are the seas still dry Don't blame this sleeping satellite Have we lost what it takes to advance Have we peaked too soon If the world is so green Then why does it scream under a blue moon We wonder why If the earth's sacrificed For the price of its greatest treasureWhen you think you've reached the end of the line Walls that once blocked your way Come tumbling down And you'll find the answers were there all the time When we turn out the lights and we sit in the dark Is the mountain too high to climb Halfway to heaven When you're flat on your back you can still see the stars Guiding you through the night Halfway to paradise Tin gods plan Life's doors slam To hold you back When you're born on the wrong side of the track Don't take no Take hold Don't leave it to chance You let the world roll by You're trying to hang yourself without a rope Mister dream - take control I am the means to reach your goal
