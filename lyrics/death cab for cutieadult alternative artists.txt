Love of mine, someday you will die But I'll be close behind, I'll follow you into the dark No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white Just our hands clasped so tight, waiting for the hint of a spark If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied Illuminate the "no"s on their vacancy signs If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks Then I'll follow you into the dark In Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black And I held my tongue as she told me, "Son Fear is the heart of love," so I never went back If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied Illuminate the "no"s on their vacancy signs If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks Then I'll follow you into the dark You and me have seen everything to see From Bangkok to Calgary and the soles of your shoes Are all worn down, the time for sleep is now But it's nothing to cry about 'cause we'll hold each other soon In the blackest of roomsThe Atlantic was born today, and I'll tell you how The clouds above opened up and let it out I was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere When the water filled every hole And thousands upon thousands made an ocean Making islands where no island should go, oh no Most people were overjoyed, they took to their boats I thought it less like a lake and more like a moat The rhythm of my footsteps crossing flatlands to your door Have been silenced forevermore The distance is quite simply much too far for me to row It seems farther than ever before, oh no I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closerAnd it came to me then that every plan Is a tiny prayer to Father Time As I stared at my shoes in the I CU That reeked of piss and 409 And I rationed my breaths as I said to myself That I'd already taken too much today As each descending peak on the L CD Took you a little farther away from me Away from me Amongst the vending machines and year-oldâ€‹ magazines In a place where we only say goodbye It stung like a violent wind that our memories depend On a faulty camera in our minds And I knew that you were a truth I would rather lose Than to have never lain beside at all And I looked around at all the eyes on the ground As the T V entertained itself'Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room Just nervous paces bracing for bad news And then the nurse comes 'round and everyone lifts their head But I'm thinking of what Sarah said That love is watching someone dieI want to live where soul meets body And let the sun wrap its arms around me, and Bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing And feel, feel what it's like to be new'Cause in my head, there's a Greyhound station Where I send my thoughts to far-off destinations So they may have a chance of finding a place where They're far more suited than here Ba-da ba-da-ba-ba Ba-da ba-ba-ba-da-ba-ba Ba-da ba-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-da-ba And I cannot guess what we'll discover When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels But I know our filthy hands can wash one another's And not one speck will remain And I do believe it's true That there are roads left in both of our shoes But if the silence takes you, then I hope it takes me too So, Brown Eyes, I'll hold you near'Cause you're the only song I want to hear A melody softly soaring through my atmosphereAnd when I see you, I really see you upside down But my brain knows better, it picks you up and turns you around Turns you around, turns you around If you feel discouraged that there's a lack of color here Please don't worry, lover, it's really bursting at the seams From absorbing everything, the spectrums A to Z Ahh-ahh, ahh-ahh Ahh-ahh, ahh-ahh, ahh-ahh This is fact, not fiction, for the first time in years And all the girls in every girly magazine can't make me feel Any less alone, I'm reaching for the phone To call at 7:03 And on your machine I slur a plea for you to come home But I know it's too late And I should have given you a reason to stay Given you a reason to stay Given you a reason to stay Given you a reason to stay Digging for gold in my neighborhood Where all the old buildings stood And they keep digging it down and down So that their cars can live underground The swinging of a wrecking ball Through these lath and plaster walls Is letting all the shadows free The ones I wish still followed me Followed me, followed me Followed me, followed me I remember a winter's night We kissed beneath the street lamp light Outside our bar near the record store That have been condos for a year and more Now that our haunts have taken flight And been replaced with construction sites Oh, how I feel like a stranger here Searching for something that's disappearedThere is whiskey in the water And there is death upon the vine There is fear in the eyes of your father And there is "yours" and there is "mine"There is a desert veiled in pavement And there's a city of seven hills All our debris flows to the ocean To meet again, I hope it will How could something so fair be so cruel When this black sun revolved around you There is an answer in a question And there is hope within despair And there is beauty in a failure And there are depths beyond compare There is a role of a lifetime And there's a song yet to be sung And there's a dumpster in the driveway Of all the plans that came undoneThis is the moment that you know That you told her that you loved her, but you don't You touch her skin, and then you think That she is beautiful, but she don't mean a thing to me Yeah, she is beautiful, but she don't mean a thing to me I spent two weeks in Silver Lake The California sun cascading down my face There was a girl with light brown streaks And she was beautiful, but she didn't mean a thing to me Yeah, she was beautiful, but she didn't mean a thing to me I wanted to believe in all the words that I was speaking As we moved together in the dark And all the friends that I was telling, all the playful misspellings And every bite I gave that left a mark When tiny vessels oozed into your neck and formed the bruises That you said you didn't want to fade But they did, and so did I that day All I see are dark grey clouds In the distance, moving closer with every hour So when you ask, "Is something wrong "I think, "You're damn right there is, but we can't talk about it now"No, we can't talk about it nowI roll the window down, and then begin to breathe in The darkest country road and the strong scent of evergreen From the passenger seat as You are driving me home Then looking upwards, I strain my eyes and try To tell the difference between shooting stars and satellites From the passenger seat as You are driving me home"Do they collide " I ask, and you smile With my feet on the dash, the world doesn't matter When you feel embarrassed, then I'll be your pride When you need directions, then I'll be the guide For all time For all timeThe glove compartment is inaccurately named And everybody knows it So I'm proposing a swift, orderly change'Cause behind its door There's nothing to keep my fingers warm And all I find are souvenirs from better times Before the gleam of your taillights fading east To find yourself a better life I was searching for some legal document As the rain beat down on the hood When I stumbled upon pictures I tried to forget And that's how this idea was drilled into my head'Cause it's too important to stay the way it's been But there's no blame for how our love did slowly fade And now that it's gone, it's like it wasn't there at all And here I rest, where disappointment and regret Collide, lying awake at night
