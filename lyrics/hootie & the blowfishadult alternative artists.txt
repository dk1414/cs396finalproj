You and me We come from different worlds You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls Sometimes you're crazy And you wonder why I'm such a baby 'cause the Dolphins make me cry Well there's nothing I can do I've been looking for a girl like you You look at me You've got nothing left to say I moan and pout at you until I get my way I won't dance You won't sing I just want to love you but you want to wear my ring Well there's nothing I can do I only wanna be with you You can call me your fool I only wanna be with youShe sits alone by a lamp post Trying to find a thought that's escaped her mind She says Dad's the one I love the most But Stipe's not far behind She never lets me in Only tell me where's she's been When she's had too much to drink I say that I don't care I just run my hands through her dark hair Then I pray to God, you gotta help me fly away and just Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain Let her sing, if it eases all her pain Let her go, let her walk right out on me And if the sun comes up tomorrow Let her be, let her be This morning I woke up alone Found a note standin' by the phone Saying maybe, maybe I'll be back some day I wanted to look for you You walked in, I didn't know just what I should do So I sat back down and had a beer and felt sorry for myself Saying.. With a little love and some tenderness We'll walk upon the water, we'll rise above the mess With a little peace and some harmony We'll take the world together, we'll take 'em by the hand'Cause I got a hand for you, oh'Cause I wanna run with you Yesterday, I saw you standin' there Your head was down, your eyes were red, no comb had touched your hair I said get up and let me see you smile We'll take a walk together, walk the road awhile, 'cause'Cause I got a hand for you'Cause I wanna run with you Want you to hold my hand I'll take you to a place where you can be Anything you wanna be because I wanna love you the best that..  the best that I canTime, why you punish me Like a wave crashing into the shore You wash away my dreams Time, why you walk away Like a friend with somewhere to go You left me crying Can you teach me about tomorrow And all the pain and sorrow, running free Cause tomorrow's just another day And I don't believe in time Time, I don't understand Children killing in the street Dying for the color of a rag Time, take their red and blue Wash them in the ocean, make them clean Maybe their mothers won't cry tonight Can you teach me about tomorrow And all the pain and sorrow, running free But tomorrow's just another day And I don't believe in.. You got your big girls Now you have your young one too Wondering if some day I could have them The way I once had you I remember your crazy remarks We'd get drunk and go out after dark Searching for someone we could take home And see her go It's tomorrow There she goes You'll be old So what are you gonna do about me I'll be there when you have no one else Spotted the ocean in the south's holy land I'll be there, be your friendTrouble with the world is we're too busy to think about it, all right Why is there a rebel flag hanging from the state house walls Tired of hearin' this shit about heritage not hate Time to make the world a better place Why must we hate one another Well no matter what, we gotta live together Just 'cause you don't look like me; tell me, what do you see When we pass on the street, what do you wanna see P.E.'s coming is all I gotta say Wanna turn and run away They're just telling you how they see it Right or wrong, they don't care; you wish that they would quit Drowning, in a sea of tears Hatred, trying to hide your fears Living, only for yourself Hating, everybody else 'cause they don't look like you Nanci singing it's a hard life wherever you go About some fat racist living in Chicago Trying to teach his kids to hate everyone Well tell me, why is that something you wanna teach your son Why must we hate one another When the people in the church, they tell me you're my brother You don't walk like me, said you don't talk like me Saying "Go back to Africa," I just don't understandEverytime I look at you, I go blind Everytime I look at you, I go blind Everytime I look at you, I go blind Everytime I look at you, I go blind In the mornin' I get up And I try to feel alive, but I can't Every time I look at you, I go blind I don't know what it is Something in me just won't give me a chance I think it's that I feel more confused By the deal love has shown me Little child, did you know that there's a light And it's gonna shine right through your eyes What do you think that life is like Every time I look at you, I go blind I go blind Well somewhere over there there's a purpose There's a care for free In me there's no body, no one plan No one stand to be free I think it's that because I have seen all the fuss And it's no big deal  No big dealAboard his ship he stops to stare Needs to smell her, touch her hair Say's "I can't be without her"Tonight he's going to be without her"It's late now", she say's Makes her mind up goes to bed Another night alone without him Another night alone in Charleston When I wake to find the solace of All that we've become I can't wait to make the promises I've been leery of Take me down Let me see I'll be there waiting In the morning when times have changed I'll be there through the lies and all I'll be standing like a soldier for you You hold your secrets Through the days when I need to be alone I will wait for you Through the rise and fallLast night had a crazy dream You were everywhere it seemed You were filling up my soul Doin' everything to make me whole Read about you in the Sunday paper Saw your face on the evening news When I woke everything was gone And I remembered we were through Don't come 'round here no more Hey get out of my mind Then you tell me we got things to say You come around here looking so fine Makes it so hard to walk away Oh, get out of my head Because that look there could leave me dead Then you tell me that you love me Remember you were the one to leave I came back home and I couldn't believe I know I would have given anything You took it all and you made me think Why would she leave me for another man What does he have, Lord, that I don't have I see you stayin' in his fancy home I put on Lauren and I drink alone and say Don't come 'round here no moreTomorrow used to be a day away Now love is gone and you're into someone far away I never thought the day would come When I would see his hand, not mine, holding on to yours Because I could not find the time And now I can't deny 'nothing lasts forever'But I don't want to leave and see the teardrops in your eyes I don't want to live to see the day we say goodbye Now there comes another part of life I call 'alone'Sitting at a bar with Chris that I can't leave'Cause my house ain't no home, no I just want to touch you, girl, I want to feel you close to me Without your love, I would give up now and walk away so easily So, maybe, while we're young, we'll figure out together That, even with the pain, there's a remedy and we'll be alright I don't want to live to see the day we say goodbye When I first met you, I couldn't love anyone Oh, but you stole my dreams and you made me see That I can walk into the sun and I can still be me
