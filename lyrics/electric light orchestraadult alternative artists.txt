The sun is shining in the sky There ain't a cloud in sight It's stopped raining, everybody's in the play And don't you know it's a beautiful new day Hey, hey, hey Running down the avenue See how the sun shines brightly In the city, on the streets where once was pity Mr  Blue Sky is living here today Hey, hey, hey Mr  Blue Sky, please tell us why You had to hide away for so long Where did we go wrong Mr  Blue Sky, please tell us why You had to hide away for so long Where did we go wrong One, two One, two, three You got me running, going out of my mind You got me thinking that I'm wasting my time Don't bring me down No, no, no, no, no Ooh-ooh-hoo I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor Don't bring me down You wanna stay out with your fancy friends I'm telling you, it's gotta be the end Don't bring me down No, no, no, no, no Ooh-ooh-hoo I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor Don't bring me downYou made a fool of me But them broken dreams have got to end Hey woman, you got the blues'Cause you ain't got no one else to use There's an open road that leads nowhere So just make some miles between here and there There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in You took my body and played to win Ha, ha, woman, it's a cryin' shame But you ain't got nobody else to blame Evil woman Evil woman Evil woman Evil woman Rolled in from another town Hit some gold, too hot to settle down But a fool and his money soon go separate ways You found a fool lyin' in a daze Ha, ha, woman, what you gonna do You destroyed all the virtues that the Lord gave you It's so good that you're feeling pain But you better get your face on board the very next trainSailin' away On the crest of a wave It's like magic Oh, rollin' and ridin'And slippin' & slidin'It's magic And you and your sweet desire You took me, oh, higher and higher, baby It's a livin' thing It's a terrible thing to lose It's a given thing What a terrible thing to lose Making believe This is what you conceived From your worst day Oh, moving in line Then you look back in time To the first day Hello  How are you Have you been alright through all those lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely Lonely nights  That's what I'd say I'd tell you everything if you'd pick up that telephone Yeah, yeah, yeah Hey  How you feelin'?Are you still the same  Don't you realise the things we did, we did Were all for real, not a dream I just can't believe they've all faded out of view Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh-ooh Doo-wop, do-be-doo-doo-wop, doo-wah, doo-lang Blue days, black nights, doo-wah, doo-lang I look into the sky And I wonder why Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time I'm living in twilight Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time I'm living in twilightThe city streets are empty now And so the songs are way down low A sound that flows into my mind Of everything that is alive I turn to stone, when you are gone I turn to stone Turn to stone, when you comin' home I can't go on The dying embers of the night Still glow upon the wall so bright The tired streets that hide away Roll past my door into the day In my blue worldWhen I was a boy, I had a dream All about the things I'd like to be Soon as I was in my bed Music played inside my head When I was a boy, I had a dream When I was a boy, I learned to play Far into the night and drift away Don't want to work on the milk or the bread Just want to play my guitar instead When I was a boy, I had a dream And radio waves kept me company In those beautiful days when there was no money When I was a boy, I had a dream When I was a boy, I had a dream Finding out what life could really mean Don't want a job 'cause it drives me crazy Just wanna sing, "Do you love me, baby "When I was a boy, I had a dreamOne, two, three, four!Everybody all around the world Gotta tell you what I just heard There's gonna be a party all over the world I got a message on the radio But where it came from, I don't really know And I heard these voices calling all over the world All over the world Everybody got the word Everybody everywhere Is gonna feel tonight Everybody walkin' down the street Everybody movin' to the beat They're gonna get hot down in the U.S.A We're gonna take a trip across the sea Everybody come along with me We're gonna hit the night down in gay ParisWhere did you go I was searchin'  on a one-way street I was hopin'  for a chance to meet I was waitin' for the operator on the line What can I do  No, no, no Don't know what I'm gonna do I gotta get back to you You gotta slow down Sweet talkin' woman You got me runnin' , you got me searchin'Hold on Sweet talkin' lover It's so sad if that's the way it's over I was , many days go by I was thinkin'  'bout the lonely nights Communication breakdown all aroundHmm, hold on tight to your dream Hey, hold on tight to your dream When you see your ship go sailing When you feel your heart is breaking Hold on tight to your dream, hmm It's a long time to be gone Oh, time just rolls on and on When you need a shoulder to cry on When you get so sick of trying, just-a Hold on tight to your dream When you get so down that you can't get up And you want so much, but you're all out of luck When you're so downhearted and misunderstood Just over and over and over you could, oh Accroche-toi à ton rêve Accroche-toi à ton rêve Quand tu vois ton bateau partir Quand tu sens ton cœur se briser Accroche-toi à ton rêve
