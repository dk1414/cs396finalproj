Six thirty in the morning, I'd just got to sleep I felt so tired didn't even count sheep I woke up with six policemen standing by the bed The voice of doom was ringing in my head Get up fella, and don't make no fuss Put your clothes on, you gotta come with us To cell number seven Cell number seven Cell number seven Cell number seven ain't exactly Heaven Bill the con said, I think it appears I've only been dreaming the last four years Wiggy said, I'm having so much fun Cell number one has something for everyone Meanwhile in Boston the kids were queuing Back in Montreal we were just stewing In cell number seven Cell number seven Cell number seven Cell number seven's a long way from Heaven Micky boy was busy banging his cell While the admiral was trying to talk his way outta Hell Well Bobby needs a change of seed and sand The promoter's tearing out his hair screaming where's the band Who'd drown a cat Who'd do a thing like that If you would, you're mine Who'd whip a horse A lost soul of course Those who would are mine They're mine , they're mine They're mine  , they're mine Who'd rob an old woman Take her pension from her bag Those who, steal are mine Who'd take a life Being friend, foe, wife Those who kill are mine They're mine , they're mine They're mine , they're mine Get behind me Satan The devil takes all those that sin Deliver us from evil The devil takes all those that sinJust give me one year of your life my friend And I'll make you look twenty years younger I've done it for others I can do it for you New life, new body, and new friends too I can make you look as you've never felt before Here's a very famous film star Who took a one year course of my treatment Ten inches off the waist New hair stuck on with paste And he acts as well as he ever did before You'll be as virile as ever Unaffected by the weather Old age will seem to pass you by And you won't detect a sign, of old Father Time Over sixty but you'll look like thirty-four A very prominent politician In danger of losing his position A devastating smile Looked real up to a mile And he lies as well as he ever did before This very well known pop singer Had ceased to be a swinger New hair, nose, teeth, and eyes Touch of padding round the thighs And he sings as well as he ever did beforeMy life's in jeopardy Murdered in cold blood is what I'm gonna be I ain't been home since Friday night And now my wife is coming after me Give me police protection Gonna buy a gun To look after number one Give me a bodyguard A black belt Judo expert with a machine gun Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane When she catches up with me Won't be no time to explain She thinks I've been with another woman And that's enough to send her half insane Gonna buy a fast car Put on my lead boots And take a long, long drive I may end up spending all my money But I'll still be alive All I did was have a bit too much to drink And I picked the wrong precinct Got picked up by the law And now I ain't got time to thinkWhen I was a kid my mother used to tell me If you don't behave and do what I say I'm going to tell your Dad when he gets home And there'll be hell to pay Pick yourself up off the floor And put those toys away Wash that face and hands You'd think your skin was turning gray The Bogeyman will get you Sure as night turns into day The Bogey man will get you He'll come and drag you away Sit up straight and eat your greens Stop playing with your food Don't pick your nose at the table Go straight to bed, that's very rude So I spent the night with my head in the covers Protected by electric light When my Mom came in to say good night I nearly died of fright The Bogeyman will get you Sure as night turns into day The Bogeyman will get you He'll come and drag you awayI want to live with a cinnamon girl I could be happy the rest of my life With a cinnamon girl A dreamer of pictures, I run in the night You see us together, chasing the moonlight My cinnamon girl Ten silver saxes, a bass with a bow The drummer relaxes and waits between shows For his cinnamon girl A dreamer of pictures, I run in the night You see us together, chasing the moonlight My cinnamon girl Pa, send me money now I'm gonna make it somehow I need another chance You see your baby loves to dance Yeah, yeah, yeahYou're in trouble Big trouble Judy's boyfriend got out today When he was in jail you took his girl away When he gets back you're gonna have to pay him double You'd better worry Or you'll be sorry He's at the edge of town and he's got a gun Better get out fast, get up and run You won't get no help from anyone here son Better hurry Forget the romance Move your pants If you don't get out now You won't get another chance Cause he's a mad dog Don't get into a fight He's a mad dog Better shoot on sight Before he tries to bite You'd better run 'til you drop Don't try to stop Find a mountain And climb right up to the topSomeone called the other day Said old Teddy Greenstreets passed away They buried him on Saturday They said it was a lovely way to go In his sleep, didn't know a thing His wife couldn't go Her second husband took her uptown to a show His sons and daughters emigrated Said it cost too much to travel home Sent a wreath and a sheath Isn't it a shame that no one came The funeral was quiet, but all the same He's much better off where he is now Rest in peace, Teddy Someone called the other day Said old Teddy Greenstreets passed away They buried him on Saturday They said it was a lovely way to go In his sleep, didn't know a thing Isn't it a shame that no one came The funeral was quiet, but all the same He's much better off where he is now Rest in peace, Teddy Rest in peace, TeddyI'm drowning in the fountain of your love In the whirlpool of my mind you're all I'm thinking of I'm sinking into the tear drops in your eyes I'm floating on the cushion of your sighs It's hard to write a love song That has something new to say It's hard to write a love song Without using old clich√©s I love you I need you, I want you for my own Please don't ever leave me, I couldn't stand to be alone I'm swimming in the ocean of your kiss How could I have known, your kiss would be like this This is my first love song And this is my last I'm getting too choked up inside Better finish it fast I'm sailing through the stars up above I'm drowning, in the fountain of your loveGirls are a thing that have always mystified me One thing I'll never understand There's more of those girls than us boys But they never seem to be at hand Well, I decided I was gonna be a real lady killer I was gonna get more than my share So I went out hunting and soon found out It's safer hunting grizzly bear So much for the lady killer You never could So much for the lady killer You just ain't no good Let me tell you 'bout number one She sure was fun I met her at a dance it was my first romance I was a lucky son of a gun We danced for a while then she flashed a smile So I said let's take a walk outside She said I don't think I'd better, here comes my fella He had shoulders four feet wide So much for the lady killer You haven't got a clue So much for the lady killer The ladies are killing you
