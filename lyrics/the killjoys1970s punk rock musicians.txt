I come undone, wound too tight I know that I'm wrong and you were right I can't look you in the face Cause I know with my normal grace You can put me on the shelf Then take me down again when you feel like myself I come undone, wound too tight I know that I'm wrong and you were right I can't look you in the face Cause I know with my normal grace You can put me on the shelf Then take me down again when you feel like myself It was another cure Never bothered, just ignored I'm not anything at all I'm not a monster, I'm a friend who raves and drools Will you come around Well, you might I know that I'm wrong and you were right I can't look you in the face Cause I know with my normal grace You were pristine, I was filth Let's just get it out and get it over withShe's got bedroom eyes and they're shifty Yeah I know, I know But she's got a little pout and she's pretty So I won't let go No I won't get soaked No I won't get soaked She's got American thighs, but they're creepy Yeah I know, I know But she's got a little pout and she's pretty So I won't let go No I won't get soaked No I won't get soaked She's got bedroom eyes and they're shifty Yeah I know, I know But she's got a little pout and she's pretty So I won't let go No I won't get soaked No I won't get soakedI’ve been alone with my demons now Long enough to call them my friends I’ve swallowed every pair of scissors in this house To cut off my loose ends It still won’t be enough to reopen The parts of me I fear have been sealed for good The water under your bridge is overflowing I love harder than I should You need me until you don’t, I’m at the end of my rope You need me until you don’t, I’m at the end of my rope I am not your fool, no, not anymore I am not your fool, from now on I’ll keep one foot out the door This road I’ve been travеling on Has all along been thin ice In rose colored daydrеams, it seems I’ve wasted all my timeShe's got a hunch in her back and a fire in her eyes And she's crossing four lane traffic There's a life on the other side of this hopeless divide And nothing's gonna keep her from it, no She's tried playing it safe, but there's no time to waste Her heart is ripping right through its seams She's tried playing it safe, but there's no time to wait For that traffic light to turn green What's the point in wasting all your time Waiting on a lifeline On the other side of fear Who knows what you might find She's got a hunch in her back and a fire in her eyes And she's reading aloud a love letter To a woman, she knows, is impossible though She doesn't need to actually get her Wherever you go is where you are And the next crossroad is never far What if you gave in and just let it out Aren't you tired of waiting aroundAre we any closer to the truth I haven't seen any poetry in the streets Just the blood of the youth Boy, it's the land of the free Until you're 18 and shipped off to foreign lands Forced to fight for your country, oh Oh, we wanted to believe in Something bigger than ourselves Swore to make it all great again See how the dream melts And nothing really seems that great to me It kinda seems like we're all on fire And pitiful rivers won't douse the flames Oh, they just keep rising highеr A history book splattered With blood on evеry page So much for freedom When your interests have changedOne thing I know for sure Is that time, sweet time alone ain't a cure There's a sickness in my bones And it's calling out for you Hear it tap, tap, tapping on my skull Until the day it finally breaks through If there's a secret drug That would swallow you up Take it from my memory, bleach it from my mind I would pay a million dollars if only I could find some peace I keep it to myself Cause I can't think of anyone else You've got me wrapped in silly little knots I keep it to myself Cause I know it's bad for my health You are putting me through hell But hey, at least I keep it to myself You should've known from thе start All I wanted was to be ripped apart My patiеnce is wearing thin But my blood never runs dry Must I be on my back for us to see eye to eyeI crashed my car Knew from afar You'd hurt like hell Set me on fire With my desire You did it well With your attack I just looked back And with a glance I should've seen you coming, babe I didn't stand a chance Just with your eyes You robbed me blind Of all my woe And with your song You made me strong Don't let me go With mass destruction Your seduction Broke right through You aimed your pistol at my heart And shot your target trueHey!I’m terrified of love songs And irrevocable going-ons And I know that I don’t sing enough And I think I know I think too much Is there a step-by-step guide A quick how-to or side-by-side If only I could ever find a way To tell you all I need to say How proud she is all on her own How bad she is at being alone Before I completely lose my head Let’s fall and crawl our way to bed Put my heart out on my sleeve So I won’t ask you not to leave Hold and tell me not to fear The river floods this year And if the stars don’t evеr blink Then maybe I don’t have to thinkSweetheart, tell me why you stay And why you let him get his way When you know he’s got his eye On another man’s goodbye, Miss Yesterday Sweetheart, tell me how you live And what you’ve got that’s left to give Other than your fourth finger And the one that’s on the trigger, and can you forgive So young, oh god, what a waste To think you’re attached at the waist There’s so much more you’re allowed Than what you’ve already said out loud Amelia Girl of the millennia The modern woman doesn’t feel She’ll never die, she won’t quit And you know she’ll never kneel Amelia Girl of the millennia The viper that bites the heel Says, “Do or die  Make the deal Or reinvent the wheel”It's a magical view The sky's a little closer The earth spins slower The sun's a little lower Not too high So it doesn't blind me And with you beside me I think I'll take my time wondering why Cause it's a magical view I see things I never thought were true Yeah, it's a magical view When I see the world through you I awoke in a fantasy Shrouded in a canopy Of sparks divine and 3/4 time Of the newly mine and the left behind The old ways of day-to-day Are nothing more than hеarsay Pockets full of push and pull Intoxicants of cape and bull
