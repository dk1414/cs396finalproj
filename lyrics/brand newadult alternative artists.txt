Jesus Christ, that's a pretty face The kind you'd find on someone that could save If they don't put me away Well, it’ll be a miracle Do you believe you're missing out That everything good is happening somewhere else But with nobody in your bed The night's hard to get through And I will die all alone And when I arrive I won’t know anyone Well, Jesus Christ, I’m alone again So what did you do those three days you were dead 'Cause this problem's gonna last More than the weekend Well, Jesus Christ, I’m not scared to die But I’m a little bit scared of what comes after Do I get the gold chariot Do I float through the ceiling Do I divide and pull apart 'Cause my bright is too slight to hold back all my dark And this ship went down in sight of land And at the gates does Thomas ask to see my hands As we glide over whatever We know to be over forever I really hope the shame is less For what we feel in times of stress But, I guess that's just depression No sense in fighting it now You had me caught in your headlights You were running me down We speak in tongues and start to teethe Lift your voice and scrape your knees Kids in love will plant a seed Resurrect and start to breathe I thought I was a creator I'm here just hanging around Got my messiah impression I think I got it nailed down I want to tell you we're alright Want to erase all your doubt I've got this thorn dug in deeply Sometimes I can't get it out Sometimes I can't get it out Sometimes I can't get it out Sometimes I can't get it outIf it makes you less sad, I will die by your hand I hope you find out what you want, I already know what I am And if it makes you less sad, we'll start talking again You can tell me how vile I already know that I am I'll grow old, start acting my age Be a brand new day in a life that you hate A crown of gold, a heart that's harder than stone And it hurts a whole lot but it's missed when it's gone Call me a safe bet, I'm betting I'm not I'm glad that you can forgive Only hoping as time goes, you can forget And if it makes you less sad, I'll move out of the state You can keep to yourself, I'll keep out of your way And if it makes you less sad, I'll take your pictures all down Every picture you paint, I will paint myself out It's cold as a tomb and it's dark in your room When I sneak to your bed to pour salt in your wounds So call it quits or get a grip Say you wanted a solution, you just wanted to be missedKate, it's your ride Get your petals out and lay them in the aisle Pretend you're God and grow, and it’s your day to wed We found your man, he's drinking up, he's All-American And he'll drive He's volunteered with grace to end your life He'll tidy up It's sad to hold, but leave your shell to us You explode You firefly, you tiny boat with oars Feather oars  The world tilts back and pours and pours And so, you satellite You tidal wave, you're a big surprise And I've one more night to be your mother The signal interrupted My baby's frequency not strong enough Remain in my hands and smile We will miss you but in time you'll get set up And we will write A beauty supreme, yeah you were right about me Can I get myself out from underneath this guilt that will crush me And in the choir I saw a sad messiah He was bored and tired of my laments Said, "I died for you one time but never again"This tape recounts a dream which occurred close to the termination of approximately 400 hours of intensive, individual therapy  Now, the patient recounts her dream:I had this dream earlier this morning and I wrote it down  The dream is that I'm in some sort of a..  and I'm in a hotel I'm at..  I'm like at a convention or something  And I feel sort of almost like there's too much going on  There are all different kinds of meetings going on  Stuff on experimental psych and therapy, chemical aspects  All of it But, I'm..  while I don't mind having all this going on inside of me  It's sort of..  I think I'm going to be relieved when it's over  When I can sort of settle back down It's where you live, but you don't know how it's built If we're just dust, then it doesn't matter who you kill Don't cut me up, then tell me that it's ok Just turn it off 'cause I don't care anyway It lit me up It lit me up It lit me up It lit me up Something stirrin' in a deep Atlantic trench Doesn't forget the thousand years before it slept It's the beast, it's my heart, it's old bread I dive down into its unit in its headIt's hard to walk through all the places that your life used to be in So you thought you'd shed a layer, maybe try on some new skin Your friends are all imaginary, your shrink stopped answering her phone So you decide to make incisions at your home while you're alone, all alone But you're no tailor, you're no surgeon, none of your cuts go very straight Every new layer you uncover reveals something else you hate And then you cracked your head, and broke some bones And when you glued them back together you found out you did it wrong Well this is the same logic that got us into trouble the first time The same logic to get us out of trouble And shake off all the people we abuse I don't need to know where you come from If you don't know where you belong So how's it feel to walk around, like you're some sort of freak You're just a monster in a costume A shade of what you used to be And you've got your kind of brand new face on, where all the skin's pulled thin and taut And every kid you see starts crying so you stop going out for walks Well I guess nothing can be perfect, so here's a comforting thought At the bottom of the ocean fish won't judge you by your faultsGoodbye to sleep I think that staying up is exactly what I need Well take apart your head Take apart the counting And the flock it has bred Goodbye to love It’s a ride that will push you up Right against the wall Does everybody really need to know everyone Take apart your head Do you really think you’re really a part of it Right against the wall And is your army really one of some thousands Chew it up and swallow it And will you declare war on the loony bin You burn bright but you run out I fell asleep in the incline I can't shake this little feeling I'll never get anything right Goodbye, you liar Well, you sipped from her cup But you don't own up to anything Then you think you will inspire When I arrive will God be waiting and pacing around his throne Take apart your head Will he feel a little Old Testament I wish I could inspire And will he celebrate with fire and brimstone Take apart the demon, in the attic, to the left Yeah, I admit, I am afraid of the reckoningJesus Christ, that's a pretty face The kind you'd find on someone that could save If they don't put me away Well, it’ll be a miracle Do you believe you're missing out That everything good is happening somewhere else But with nobody in your bed The night's hard to get through And I will die all alone And when I arrive I won’t know anyone Well, Jesus Christ, I’m alone again So what did you do those three days you were dead 'Cause this problem's gonna last More than the weekend Well, Jesus Christ, I’m not scared to die But I’m a little bit scared of what comes after Do I get the gold chariot Do I float through the ceiling Do I divide and pull apart 'Cause my bright is too slight to hold back all my dark And this ship went down in sight of land And at the gates does Thomas ask to see my hands As we glide over whatever We know to be over forever I really hope the shame is less For what we feel in times of stress But, I guess that's just depression No sense in fighting it now You had me caught in your headlights You were running me down We speak in tongues and start to teethe Lift your voice and scrape your knees Kids in love will plant a seed Resurrect and start to breathe I thought I was a creator I'm here just hanging around Got my messiah impression I think I got it nailed down I want to tell you we're alright Want to erase all your doubt I've got this thorn dug in deeply Sometimes I can't get it out Sometimes I can't get it out Sometimes I can't get it out Sometimes I can't get it outIf it makes you less sad, I will die by your hand I hope you find out what you want, I already know what I am And if it makes you less sad, we'll start talking again You can tell me how vile I already know that I am I'll grow old, start acting my age Be a brand new day in a life that you hate A crown of gold, a heart that's harder than stone And it hurts a whole lot but it's missed when it's gone Call me a safe bet, I'm betting I'm not I'm glad that you can forgive Only hoping as time goes, you can forget And if it makes you less sad, I'll move out of the state You can keep to yourself, I'll keep out of your way And if it makes you less sad, I'll take your pictures all down Every picture you paint, I will paint myself out It's cold as a tomb and it's dark in your room When I sneak to your bed to pour salt in your wounds So call it quits or get a grip Say you wanted a solution, you just wanted to be missed
