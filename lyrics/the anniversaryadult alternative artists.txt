I've seen those eyes I've watched them close at night And you breathe in And you breathe out again Sister's coming over and I'm afraid to tell her Secrets that I know Painting without colors tends to make it better It bleaches out the world Was it the end The end that kept you up till the morning Was it the boy The boy who stole your heart Summer goes on and then dies quick without much warning All things ordinary Will you stay near me now Don't leave this town until we've figured out Between the two of us, we're strong enough I feel that in your touch Full from the dinner, but feeling somewhat thinner Aching in the chest Kids behind the windows, calling out the answers To questions never askedFeeling the time peel away at my life again As memories combine, not sure where I've ever been Cause it's the D in Detroit, which scares me to no end I'll count to ten when living this down makes so much sense We collide, and onward we do fly We collide, and onward we do fly Onward, until we hit again I kept your picture just behind the eye Those weeks when our distance grew Drove north where I found you waiting in Des Moines Thank god I'm not losing you And girl, I hope you're not alone And sleep through this weather And girl, I hope you're whole again Back home, we'll sleep better We collide, and onward we do fly We collide, and onward we do fly I kept your picture just behind
