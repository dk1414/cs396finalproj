It's knowin' that your door is always open And your path is free to walk That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag Rolled up and stashed behind your couch And it's knowin' I'm not shackled By forgotten words and bonds And the ink stains that are dried upon some line That keeps you in the backroads By the rivers of my memory It keeps you ever gentle on my mind It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy Planted on their columns now that bind me Or something that somebody said Because they thought we fit together walkin'It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find That you're movin' on the backroads By the rivers of my memory And for hours you're just gentle on my mind Though the wheat fields and the clotheslines And the junkyards and the highways come between us And some other woman's cryin' to her mother'Cause she turned, and I was goneI am a lineman for the county And I drive the main road Searchin' in the sun for another overload I hear you singing in the wire I can hear you through the whine And the Wichita lineman Is still on the line I know I need a small vacation But it don't look like rain And if it snows that stretch down south Won't ever stand the strain And I need you more than want you And I want you for all time And the Wichita lineman Is still on the lineSouthern nights Have you ever felt a Southern night Free as a breeze Not to mention the trees Whistlin' tunes that you know and love so Southern nights Just as good even when closed your eyes I apologize To anyone who can truly say That he has found a better way Southern skies Have you ever noticed Southern skies  Its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye It goes runnin' through your soul Like the stories told of old Old man He and his dog, they walk the old land Every flower touched his cold hand As he slowly walked by Weepin' willows would cry for joy, joyI'm still here, but yet I'm gone I don't play guitar or sing my songs They never defined who I am The man that loves you 'til the end You're the last person I will love You're the last face I will recall And best of all, I'm not gonna miss you Not gonna miss you I'm never gonna hold you like I did Or say I love you to the kids You're never gonna see it in my eyes It's not gonna hurt me when you cry I'm never gonna know what you go through All the things I say or do All the hurt and all the pain One thing selfishly remains I'm not gonna miss you I'm not gonna miss youBy the time I get to Phoenix She'll be risin'She'll find the note I left hangin'On her door She'll laugh when she reads the part That says I'm leavin''Cause I've left that girl so many times before By the time I make Albuquerque She'll be workin'She'll prob'ly stop at lunch And give me a call But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringin'Off the wall That's all By the time I make Oklahoma She'll be sleepin'She'll turn softly And call my name out low And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her Though time and time I've tried to tell her so She just didn't know I would really goI've been walkin' these streets so long Singin' the same old song I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway Where hustle's the name of the game And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain There's been a load of compromisin'On the road to my horizon But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me Like a rhinestone cowboy Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo Like a rhinestone cowboy Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know And offers comin' over the phone Well, I really don't mind the rain And a smile can hide all the pain But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way And I dream of the things I'll do With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe There'll be a load of compromisin'On the road to my horizon But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on meIf you miss the train I'm on You will know that I am gone You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles Lord I'm one, Lord I'm two, Lord I'm three, Lord I'm four I'm 500 miles away from home Not a shirt on my back Not a penny to my name Lord I can't go back this a'way This a'way, this a'way, this a'way, this a'way Lord I can't go back this a'way Well, I'm walking these ties With tears in my eyes Trying to read a letter from my home From my home, from my home, from my home, from my home Trying to read a letter from my home If this train's running right I'll be home by Saturday night I'm 500 miles away from home Away from home, away from home, away from home, away from home I'm 500 miles away from homeTake my hand for a while Explain it to me once again Just for the sake Of my-why broken heart Look into my eyes And maybe I will understand How love I counted on Was never there You see, I-I thought That you might love me So you caught me, it seems Off balance with a heart so full Of love and pretty dreams That two should share And so, I-I know But please before you go Take my hand for a while Explain it to me once again Just for the sake Of my-why broken heartGalveston, oh Galveston I still hear your sea winds blowin'I still see her dark eyes glowin'She was twenty-one When I left Galveston Galveston, oh Galveston I still hear your sea waves crashing While I watch the cannons flashing I clean my gun And dream of Galveston I still see her standing by the water Standing there lookin' out to sea And is she waiting there for me On the beach where we used to run Galveston, oh Galveston I am so afraid of dying Before I dry the tears she's crying Before I watch Your sea birds flying in the sunHe got here red and wrinkled scared and cryin'Then she took him up and held him to her breast And he sure was glad to get what mama offered Then he went to sleep and put his fears to rest It didn't seem to matter what he needed He could always count on mama to supply And regardless of the sleep she might be losin'He always found a twinkle in her eye There ought to be a hall of fame for mamas Creation's most unique and precious pearls And heaven help us always to remember That the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world She taught him all the attributes of greatness That she knew he couldn't learn away from home And by the time she wore the cover off her bible Her hair was gray and her little man was gone There ought to be a hall of fame for mamas Creation's most unique and precious pearls And heaven help us always to remember That the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world Yes, the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world
