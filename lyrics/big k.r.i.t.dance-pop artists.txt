prolific with these scriptures they might give me a Bible Page 1, come here, son Mind your manners, just be cool I know you lame when you was in school The little fame you ain't used to And it was

mainstream never heard of Recycle all of they lingo And make sure I screw my words up Bravo for your swagger-jackin'I'm overwhelmed by your dedication You actually fooled these people into

award ain't got shit to do with us God could physically come down and say "He the greatest My favorite, y'all should listen, he have potential To outlive the heatwave I'mma send through this motherfucker And rebuild for a whole 'nother other culture"And that wouldn't be enough So fuck these haters and fuck these hoes Damn right, I still mean thatA mother lost her child, I tried to ease her pain"It's only God's will", she says she felt the same It’s funny how the sun will up and bow to rain As if the clouds couldn’t stand to see me outside again Wrote a rhyme that was kind with some vision to it Bottom line it might expand your mind if you listen to it Too much shine can dull the soul If you feel how I feel, then I'll rap some more How can the devil take my brother if he's close to me When he was everything I wasn’t but I hoped to be I get a little honest and I ask myself If the time come, will you save me if I ask for help Sent my mind on a journey to the outter most To document what it had seen and C C me the notes And ask Kurt Cobain why, cause I need to know He stopped when he had such a way long to go I saw love in the eyes of a perfect stranger She overlooked my caring heart in search of a gangster Will we ever be together only time will tell She call my phone and talked to me as her eyes would swell I put my problems in a box beside my tightest rhymes Under lock and key, buried deep off in my mind And when it gets too full and I can't close the lid I spaz on my family and my closest friends Trade my materials for a peace of mind I am so close to heaven, hell, I just need some time Who cares about life and the high’s and low’s Maybe I should write another song about pimps and hoes Cars and clothes, idol gods, golden calves, Louis scarves I do this for the love and it’s free of charge I don’t need jail to be behind bars, this is purely art In my grandma's household, this was surely taught Don’t be naïve, yeah, these times is hard In the midst of all the glamour I hope you find God I never wished to be the burden bearer But souls need saving and it’s now or never Shock value is all they wanna see It’s us against them and it’s just you and me Trying to take heed what I say in my songs Forgive me if I ever ever steered you wrong Most people stop for signs but I driven through it If it don’t touch my soul then I can’t listen to it The radio don’t play the shit I used to love Or maybe I am just growing up I never seen a star on a red rug If I wanna see stars, I just look above To the heavensCadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac

extraterrestrial flexible bitch See how far these vegetables get us Pour up, the show up, the focus The doors ain't typical when they get open, hol' up You ain't never been sky high Swear I coulda died when I hopped out my ride Like four or five times, no parachute Bungee jump for the loot Hock a loogie out the roof, what I feel like Porn on the screen, two hoes on the scene tongue kissin'You would think my whip dyke Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—too early for the hook Not sure if it's the sawed-off pump or the bass in the trunk –  –That keep a nigga shook Careful no crook, tell a bitch, “Look.”How I work the wheel and the crisis Police behind us my index was grindin' her pussy like rhyme with no timin'I think I'm nicest of all That's the way I feel, bitch  Crawl Why you showing your grill, bitch  We off Our way outta here, don't get lost I come in peace from somewhere unique Have no fear, uhI'm trying to find out what's going on with our relationship, why am I the only one that's always calling, making an effort  I understand that you're busy on the road, you have to do what you have to do for your career, but I feel like if you really want this relationship, you do what you have to do for us also  Like I'm always, always the one doing everything, and I'm just tired like..  call me back baby I'm like what happened to us, maybe I'm rapping too much I been missing your touch, sometimes I'm out and I lust What if love ain't enough, and all we have is this trust What if I'm fucking that up, so you don't trust in me much I'm wasting your time, to say I'm straight, I'd be lying It's either you or this music but I can't make up my mind I'd throw you a line, I'd give you a sign Right now I'm through with the trying, I think you ready to fly I settle for less so when I'm tired of stress I go through the motions pretending I'm at my best Fall victim to flesh, I live to be fresh But this ain't what I expect because my life is a wreck I run out of breath cause I ain't taking the steps Money comes and it goes 'til family's all I got left I'm seeing my growth, but I'm still from myself You'll be hollering out next because you're ready to fly I can't find the words so you'll just fill in the blanks I'm doing the norm and not what it takes I'll keep folding my cards and you'll keep raising the stakes'Til we forget about us and what we have is too late I know in your heart, you ain't conditioned to race So I steady the wheel, forever pumping the brakes Resort to the bottle, that's how I deal with the shakes Pray for these haters, that's how I deal with the hate Look to the sky, don't be content with the now You ain't concerned with the why, you just wanna know how I didn't give it a chance, when you just wanna be down And save me from myself, but I'm wanting to drown King is much more than the weight of a crown As good as it feels, that ain't the way that it sounds Being single is cool 'til ain't nobody around Then I'm chasing you down, cause you was ready to fly I can't be what you want me to be You're shooting too high cause you ain't aiming at me One minute you're calling out for the D Then the next minute you wanna be free Then the next minute you hollering out peace Although I know it's a war and there'll be blood in the street If you call don't be frustrated at me Just leave you're heart at the beep, cause mine is harder to reach Cause mine is harder to see And that don't make it harder to cheat Being friends would make it harder to breathe So if you ready to fly, just forget about me But if you willing to try then I'm willing to leap Out of the window of pain and fall in love at your feet I ain't the man you want me to be I guess that's what's been bothering meGet money, don’t be no lame Bench warmers never ride foreign so play the game Never drop the ball, never accept a loss Get back up if you fall, and when yo' number called You better give yo' all I hope you give yo' all You gotta play until the end The only diff' between a winner and a loser is a winner plays until he wins Ain't nothing for free so get yo' ass up My partner scared if we don’t speed then they might pass us So we hit 85, tryna keep this dream alive All I see is green, I think these screens is fucking with my sight Nowadays hoes claiming that they crushin'Bop a darling in my bucket 'til their heads catch concussions But please don’t push my buttons, I don’t know you like that Can't do no favors for these haters, I don’t owe you like that Well, I guess it’s the allure like when you need to score One second on the clock and the shot's all yours Hit or miss, we take the risk Cause anything is better than Viennas and warm grits Trading bust-it-babies for fly divas that buck Her only concern is if my car match her clutch Yeah, she's a gold digger but that pussy good So what the fuck, don’t be late for this player's ball Hurry up and.. Yeah, my creator gave me the gift to create In this mind of mine and plot our escape In an atmosphere that wouldn't hold our weight If I leave from here, I'll call when I'm safe Knocking on the door, hoping someone answers Yeah, I call that faith This mouth of mine has turned down water for wine I still recall that taste of bittersweet Like when I realize you'll never be as perfect as the one that invented me And a world full of temptations can make you feel so incomplete Grew up to be better than me, go farther than I can go See farther than I can see When my days draw to a close, breathe longer than I can breathe And I'm fine with that In the event I decide to move forward, what you've done They can rewind it back And I'm a proud parent now as I was a proud parent then I saw you grow up to become the kind of king that I knew you'd always been Indeed, there's a finish line for me, but for you, there's no end So, perhaps all that work that has been done was a win And although my intentions were for good, it still brung us to a sin But I'll pay for your mistakes as long as this world continues to spin And as this vessel of mine breaks down, I know you have never bend I'm sure as Multi is your home, hard times will come again I set aside a book of rhymes that'll pave the way for now and then I know forever is a mighty long time—so where should we begin I've been waiting to
