Sometimes these words just don't have to be said I know how you both feel, the heart can rule the head Jealousy is an essential part of love The hurting here below and the emptiness above There's always something left behind Never mind The tender caresses that bring out the man I can't still be drunk at five Oh, I guess I surely can Slowly your beauty is eaten away By the scent of someone else in the blanket where we lay There's always something left behind Maybe next time Uneaten meals A lonely star A welcome ride in a neighbor's car A long walk home The pouring rain I fell asleep when you never came Some rare delight in Manchester town It took six hours before you let me down To see it all in a drunken kiss A stranger's hand on my favourite dressNo, I sent you that letter To ask you if the end was worth the means Was there really no inbetween And I still don't feel better I just wondered if it could be like before And I think you just made me sure!But then that's typically you And I might have been a bit true But I wrote it in a bad mood I'm not being funny with you But it's hard to be engaging When the things you love keep changing Brassneck  Brassneck I just decided I don't trust you anymore I just decided I don't trust you anymore First time you came over Do you remember you saying that you'd stay for good No I didn't think you would Well we couldn't've been closer But it was different then, and that's all in the past There I've said it now at last Lost your love of life Too much apple pie Oh have you lost your love of life Too much apple pie And now Harry's walked away with Johnny's wife You've got to pick some people up You've got to let some people go But if Lee's name does come up Oh well I really want to know Because everybody loves a T.V  show Lost your love of life Too much apple pie Oh have you lost your love of life Too much apple pie And now Harry's walked away with Johnny's wife You've got to pick some people up You've got to let some people go But if Lee's name does come up Oh well I really want to know Because everybody loves a T.V  show Lost your love of life Too much apple pie Oh have you lost your love of life Too much apple pie And now Harry's walked away with Johnny's wife We've talked so long, suddenly it's Tuesday We still don't know If what we want is wrong--I just love hearing you say"Oh please don't go"Darling can't you keep your head next to my head Oh just stay here Because I can't fall asleep even in my own bed Until you're near No, you'll go away, of course that's not what I want Oh I've missed you That's what I thought you'd say but you must know that I can't Resist you You suck it all right out of me You suck it all right out of me I didn't have to search for you, I knew where you'd be hiding You astound me There's nothing I won't do to feel your body sliding All around me No, no, no, don't stop, I think I must be dreaming I'll just hold you I'm just about to drop, you thrill me with your screaming I adore you You suck it all right out of me You suck it all right out of me You suck it all right out of me You suck it allSometimes these words just don't have to be said I know how you both feel, the
