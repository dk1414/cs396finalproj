these lines to confirm Something you may know Dear Angie Please excuse the writing It's my nerves, you know When you caught your train today You took my heart and soul away I can't wait till Friday night To see you, touch you, hold you tight Dear Angie How's your folks and relatives I hope they're well Dear Angie I'm spending my vacation At that same hotel I've known you now for one whole year There's something I've not told you, dear Turned the blind eye for too long This letter proves that I've been wrongIn younger days I told myself my life would be my own And I'd leave the place where sunshine never shone For my life's too short for waiting when I see the rising sun Then I know again that I must carry on Carry on till tomorrow, there's no reason to look back Carry on, carry on, carry on Beyond the shadows of the clouds and onward to the sky Carry on till I find the rainbow's end For my life's too short for waiting when I see the rising sun Then I know again that I must carry on Carry on till tomorrow, there's no reason to look back Carry on, carry on, carry on Drifting on the wings of freedom, leave this stormy day And we'll ride to tomorrow's golden fields For my life's too short for waiting when I see the rising sun Then I know again that I must carry onSaw the railway master and I looked him in the eye I said, "Would you go much faster if you thought that you would die "He said, "Not me, sir,  I could not care,  in fact, I would not try For protest would not take me far, it's different, me not bein' a star"Locked my feelings in a jar until another day Oh, comfort me, dear brother, won't you tell me what you know For somewhere in this painful world is a place where I can go Oh, long awaitin' mother, is it time to make a show And take your babies to your breast, no, we never passed the test All our sins should be confessed before we carry on Oh, don't refuse me If you choose me, you'll follow my shame No, don't confuse me For I know it's the name of the game I got up off my pillow and I looked up at the sun I said, "You can see quite clearly now the things that we have done We burned your sacred willow and our battles we have won But did we get so very far  It's different, me not bein' a star"Lock my feelings in a jar until we go awayBelieve me, if I wanted Spend the rest of my time with a mean, mean, woman like you Would I, if I needed But I don't Will I, if you want me Give you all the love in the world that a man could Still I, if I needed I could Then I could cry your name and you would come There'd be no need for need anymore, anymore Believe me, if I wanted Spend the rest of my time with a mean, mean, woman like you Would I, if I needed But I don't Then I could cry your name and you would come There'd be no need for need anymore, anymoreIn a way, the sun has shone on me Makes it easy to make it hard Take an inch, take a yard, take it all I don't need it at all Any day, the sun could shine on you Makes it silly to make it bad Take it good, take it glad, take it all Don't you know there's a stronger thing Keepin' us together Don't you know there's a song to sing Sing on, let the feelin' take you high Don't you know there's a stronger thing Keepin' us together Don't you know there's a song to sing Sing on, let the feelin' take you high Any day, the sun will shine on you Makes it silly to take it bad Make it good, take it glad, take it all
