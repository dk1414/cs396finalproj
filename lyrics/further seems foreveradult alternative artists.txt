The moon is down And heaven is waiting For us to find her in our sites With focus that's strong But my strength keeps slipping Now we're all the terminal cases But we're so determined to thrive And those with defeat on their faces Are those that we must keep alive And I admire your strength You keep us going on You keep us going on You keep us fighting long after the fire You've measured our strides Marked the degree of our fever Charting the log Made sure the temperature's rising To fan the flames And brandish our new courage proudly As if it were ours from the outset As if we were never aloneLet's set this city ablaze We'll burn down the Monuments and build Mountains in our place we Could see everything We could start a fire and All shine in its light Shine so bright we burn in Eyes and heal the stories Ending This is the last Time we will ever bleed to Feel alive Consider This a rehearsal Your heart of hearts rekindled Catching the fruits of our Labors and holding our Hearts in our hands Waiting for you to sound a Prayer in the form of a Anchor replied by holding You up in red skies bound By loveTake this heart of darkness I give it up And all the emptyness I fill it up The times that I feel nothing You bring enough So I can live for something You lift me up And all these bad dreams I wake up to the light And when I can't see I wake up to Your eyes Wake me up There's a light up ahead There's a light up ahead There's a light up ahead There's a light up ahead It gets so complicated To live enough Turn into what you hated You're breaking up The times I feel like nothing You bring enough So I can live for something You lift me up And all these bad dreams I wake up to the light And when I can't see I wake up to Your eyes Wake me upFountains and florescent lights The season has come The snowbirds are crowding the nights The townies are tired of their beaches and bars Being packed so tight The bridges and traffic and in this selecting their flight And on these boats Ride the hopes of...Working class boys, dreaming of girls from faraway points And better things Like winter flings And longing after spring has sprung And they fly north when winter's done And we get burned in summer's sun Fountains and florescent lights The season has come The snowbirds are crowding the nights Townies and tourists find unlikely love at first sight And swear that they're never leaving And that is their plight And on these boats Ride the hopes of...Working class boys, dreaming of girls from faraway points And better things Like winter flings And longing after spring has sprung They fly north when winter's done And we get burned in summer's sunWe live and we learn and crash and we burn and were gone We take what we know and we learn as we go and we run Run until that day We can see who we are Have the final say We keep being who we are As love lights the way to the last day And no one can take it away Run and hide Don't hide at all Change is coming, know its nothing personal Live our lives Not hide it all Change is coming, know its nothing personal We live and we learn and crash and we burn and were gone We take what we know and we learn as we go and we run Run until that day We can see who we are Have the final say We keep being who we are As love lights the way to the last day And no one can take it awayHow did you find me here I covered every track I kept not souvenoir I left an open pack To slip the phone under I let my left hand down To leave you undetered I kept my right hand out To slip the phone under I kept my right hand       How did you find me here So cold So cold So cold To find another So cold So cold You find a path to me From an unwelcomed place You kept the copy key Between the skin and lace To find another To take me down again To fix another rule To try it hard and true To let it go this long To point it back to youBye, bye, bye I'm doin' this tonight You're probably gonna start a fight I know this can't be right Hey baby, come on I loved you endlessly When you weren't there for me So now it's time to leave and make it alone I know that I can't take no more It ain't no lie I wanna see you out that door Baby, bye, bye, bye I don't wanna be a fool for you Just another player in your game for two You may hate me, but it ain't no lie Baby, bye, bye, bye Don't really wanna make it tough I just wanna tell you that I had enough It might sound crazy, but it ain't no lie Baby, bye, bye, byeYour hands didn't move But neither did mine New Year's will bring So much to say But nothing comes out right Both of us left without words Both of us lost in this world It's softer than ever before And you were the outline Of everything you would become The keeper of these hands To hold you now It is a far cry More than anything that I deserve I'm waiting to give you whatever the world may bring I'd give you my life cause I don't own anything It seemed like the bottom was all that I had until now I'd give you my life, if you'd give me yours somehow Your hands didn't move Well, neither did mine New Year's Will bring Me to youYou'll be a wolf Devoured by a lion Cuz you look like a lamb Baptized in fire Fearing yet hoping The best has swallowed you Sleep once again I should go sleep Fear I'm running out of time Sometimes I feel I should sever my limbs So I could never crawl home Back home to you Waiting and watching To see if you'll follow me To my grave And I should go sleep Fear im running out of Time waits for no one time waits for no one time waits for no one time waits for no one I might not wake up next to you Excuses, excuses, excuses Made excuses for eating your young Lets lick the wounds And find out where we came from When copperas have faded out I hope you'll still be by my side This is not dystrophy But desire Desire for comfort in the dark Call me a mocking bird Call me a mocking bird And it's doneIt's been a long time since I felt the rain upon my head It's been a long time since I felt the rain upon my head A moment in separation the foreground don't seem so bright These angels in my head are in between the shadow and the light Were my arms too short to ransom you From broken skin and black and blue Unstitch your eyes and you could Read this forever and breathe this forever Dead and broken and I'm backwards turned to love My heart in a box I'd send to you For a sky held up by stars Were my arms too short to ransom you From broken skin and black and blue Unstitch your eyes and you could Read this forever and breathe this forever It's been a long time since I felt the rain upon my head Your varying degrees of grayness Tugging the deepest of heartstrings Were my arms too short to ransom you From broken skin and black and blue Unstitch your eyes and you could Read this forever and breathe this forever
