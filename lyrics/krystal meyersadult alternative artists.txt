I was chasing my dreams With a coke and a smile Only You make me happy If that was the real thing Then I'm in denial Only You make me happy Now my heart's on my sleeve Don't care if I'm not in style Only You make me happy Superficial Fake And fleeting Fashion statements have no meaning Only You make me happy Only You make me happy Everything will change But You remain the same Only You make me happy I had it under control I had it right where it wants me Only You make me happy I've got the rock and the roll It made me one of the posse Only You make me happyTell me why do you run You say you're so ashamed Bruised and broken Thought if I figured out the mess you made Then I'd leave But anywhere you are Is never too far away There's freedom from your scars The mistakes that you've made Forgiven The memories erased Baby, that's the beauty of grace La-di-da la-di-da-da Tell me what is love I'll never hold you to The things you may have done You say you want new life In my arms there's mercy Anywhere you are Is never too far away There's freedom from your scars The mistakes that you've made Forgiven The memories erased Baby, that's the beauty of grace La-di-da la-di-da-daIt's all around Pressure from my so-called friends It's all around I'm measured by some stupid trend It's all around Everyone is just like them It's all around It's all around It's all around So I'm anticonformity I don't try too hard to be I'm not what you think you see Inside I've made a change And I'll never be the same No way!They conform Un-individuality They conform Forget about variety Yeah, they conform They don't know what they believe They conform They conform They conformDear God It's me again down here Don't wanna sound insincere I'm lost Sometimes you're so unclear What can I do I'm feeling so far from you Frustrated Irritated Disconnected from it all The weight of the world Has pushed me to the wall I surrender to you I'm giving in Come take me Save me I want to start again I'll open my broken heart'Cause I've reached the end And you are the way to begin I've seen a million empty smiles Living in denial I don't wanna live like that Where nothing's real I hate how it is to feelYeah, you're so convinced Of how it's supposed to be I know that you're confused Don't take it out on me We're not afraid to try We're not afraid to dream But when it all goes wrong We're not afraid to scream'Cause the future now is ours to make Oh oh, shout it out Get ready 'cause we like it loud'Cause we were born to make some noise Don't tell me we should turn it down'Cause we were born to make some noise Make some noise Make some noise We're not the enemy You might be surprised Don't need hypocrisy To open up our eyes We don't need your rules Don't need a uniform This is who we are We won't be ignoredClose my eyes Falling on my knees The hope that's inside An overwhelming peace As time's slowing down Your soft spoken words On my heart left a stain Though no one's around And everything's broken Your beauty remains And I realize the reason You came Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Shedding a tear The taste becomes stale'Cause this is why I'm here The scar of a nail Heaven has the pleasure of having You here Nothing can measure the love that You share Angels sing welcome home Welcome homeI spent my time Trying to find A way to lose your shadow I shut you out I let you down How could I be so shallow I never thought of the consequences Until the water was over my head All along I built these walls Now I'm gonna let them fall I'm seeing for the first time The changes on the inside shining through Your love is the reason I'm alive So as I live my life In everything I do I hope you see reflections of you You watched me make all my mistakes And you always took me back Time and again you were my friend Show me how to be like that I wanna love you the way you love me I wanna learn to forgive and forget All along I built these walls I'm breaking free Let them fallYou make light from dark Illuminate my heart It started with a spark And now I'm consumed I know that it's your will So I'm gonna shine until I'm a city on a hill And they can see you And know you And know you inside You set me You lit me I'm on fire What a beautiful sight to see I'm on fire Until my light is burning bright I'm gonna lift your name and let this flame get higher Fire Let your fire feed on all my disbelief Cause you are all I need You're contagious Like a blaze I can't contain It never fades away It's sunshine through the rain That's what your love isBells of joy are ringing, Angels sweetly singing Hymns of glory, songs of exultation To the newborn Savior, lying in a manger Hymns of praise, carols of adoration King of Angels, we worship You under Heavens stars King of Angels, we celebrate the miracle You are The miracle of grace You are Jesus meek and lowly Son of God, most holy Sacred mystery of incarnation Heaven and earth adore You We fall down before You Child of mercy, hope of our salvation King of Angels, we worship You under Heavens stars King of Angels, we celebrate the miracle You are King of Angels, we worship You under Heavens stars King of Angels, we celebrate the miracle You are The miracle of grace You areMy eyes have a rosy glaze As darkness falls I’m dancing on a razor blade It’s killing me Such a dangerous attraction I’m flirting with fire A desire reason just can’t tame I’m gonna regret this It’s the shadow inside my mind And I’m in denial I’m becoming quite a liar Does that make me beautiful tonight To someone In my sickness can you find me beautiful tonight The moonlight plays against my skin You found me out Midnight sometimes is my only friend Don’t leave me now The hunger it eats me alive I’m falling, dissolving It’s crawling into my veins I’m gonna regret this Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, beautiful tonight
