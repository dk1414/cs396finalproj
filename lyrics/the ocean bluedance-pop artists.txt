Her world came crashing down And all that it contained A million pieces of dreams Coming apart at the seams But she twists and she whirls Dismissing it all away Wasn't quite the same As it was yesterday Her night begins the day Why think, when we can play I find it so hard to find A certain dress of that kind As she twists and she whirls And she dances it all away The problems persist They won't go away She twists and she whirls Dancing it all away Would rather see the night Than the reason of the dayQuietly, almost elusively Almost invisibly I found that I For a moment Had slipped away Ripped in two, then pasted back again Then crumpled up inside Then tossed aside You know that It feels so bad Oh Mercury Oh Mercury Happened once, then it Happened twice Then it happened thrice And now a fourth You know that Did you know that Ripped in two, then pasted back again Then crumpled up inside Then tossed aside You know that It feels so badWords that form a sentence Words that form a phrase In a poem Or a letter Could not convey the meaning Of what this man has done In a painting On a canvas And as the colors fading They dictate my mood Can you see me Are you near me I find myself on canvas I find myself on stage Can you see me Are you near me And I long to know you're real And I long for you to be a part of me And I long to know you're real And I long for you to be a part of meAnother radical dream Becomes a long lost friend Beneath the rhythm and sound Lies a another meaning And if you ask me today To say just what I'm thinking You might flee my reply And run it upwards and run downwards It was so sublime It was so sublime It was so sublime It was so-so-so-ba-ba-ba-lime This entangled up dream Still plays on illusion Trying hard to escape More jangled delusion And if you ask me today And you ponder life It's not just what you think It grows outward and it holds youYou may find you're all alone All around you not a sound Drifting, falling on your own again The walls of cold and grey surround, they surround You may find you're by yourself Friends have all grown up and gone away Drifting, falling you can't stop yourself The walls of cold and grey surround, they surround Drifting, falling Watching all your dreams roll by They roll by Somewhere out there She sees you and she sighs My, my, my, my, my You may find you're all alone All around you not a sound Drifting, falling on your own again The walls of cold and grey surround, they surroundFirst she came right into my life You know my life wasn't much of a life Couldn't believe this could happen to me Who, oh who, could ask for more Just let me know Just let me know What you want from me You were a friend when I hadn't a friend One on whom I could always depend Couldn't believe this could happen to me Who, oh who, could ask for more Just let me know Just let me know What you want from me Wish I knew what you were thinking deep inside Feel, those feelings that you hide Wish in you I could confide All my hopes, my fears, my loveI'm in love My friend's in love We're both in love For real Singing ya oh oh Ya oh oh Ya oh oh Love is kind It does not boast It is not proud At all Singing ya oh oh Ya oh oh Ya oh oh And love always protects And love always hopes all things And love always trusts And love always is thereHer world came crashing down And all that it contained A million pieces of dreams Coming apart at the seams But she twists and she whirls Dismissing it all away Wasn't quite the same As it was yesterday Her night begins the day Why think, when we can play I find it so hard to find A certain dress of that kind As she twists and she whirls And she dances it all away The problems persist They won't go away She twists and she whirls Dancing it all away Would rather see the night Than the reason of the dayQuietly, almost elusively Almost invisibly I found that I For a moment Had slipped away Ripped in two, then pasted back again Then crumpled up inside Then tossed aside You know that It feels so bad Oh Mercury Oh Mercury Happened once, then it Happened twice Then it happened thrice And now a fourth You know that Did you know that Ripped in two, then pasted back again Then crumpled up inside Then tossed aside You know that It feels so badWords that form a sentence Words that form a phrase In a poem Or a letter Could not convey the meaning Of what this man has done In a painting On a canvas And as the colors fading They dictate my mood Can you see me Are you near me I find myself on canvas I find myself on stage Can you see me Are you near me And I long to know you're real And I long for you to be a part of me And I long to know you're real And I long for you to be a part of me
