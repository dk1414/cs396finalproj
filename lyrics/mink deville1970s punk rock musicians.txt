notched on her chest She gotta rose tattooed on her thigh Dead men raise and sigh And it drives my young blood wild My baby's got the Cadillac walk When Rita turns down her bed Grown men plead and beg Baby honey baby you're the one Carve your name right on my gun Ain't she something nice Bones rattle my dice I slobber down my side My baby's got the Cadillac walk Lonely tonight honey hear my call She said boy I won't make you crawl Rita pound by pound Knows how to work it down Weep and cry to and fro Leave your heart she'll steal your gold No matter what the cost Ooh...them duel exhaust Make my motor sighIt's closing time in this nowhere café There's no way in the world I'm gonna let that girl Let her slip away No I can't explain just what's happening to me I can tell that guy who's sticking close by her side Knows her more than just casually But there's nothing that I wouldn't do No there's nothing that I wouldn't do No there's nothing that I wouldn't do Just to walk that little girl home Just to walk that … mmmmm Just to walk that little girl home Her flashing smile, her searching eyes Oh a promise it seems of having all of my dreams Finally realized But I can't ignore hey

the corner Something's waiting for me Is this my one big chance Or just my imagination But what I feel I know it's real Oh, this must be the night This must be the night It seems all my life I've been waiting for this moment Now I can save it all Please believe me Is it just my heart Is it playing tricks on me Why must this always be a misdirected reverie Oh, this must be the night Your eyes are still that shade of smokey grey They don't melt now when they look my way Such a shame that nothing feels the same My heart is crying, your eyes are lying There's something beautiful dying Your lips are still as red as cherry wine But they don't tremble when they're touching mine You and me we're just used to be My heart is crying, your eyes are lying It's something beautiful dying Yesterday slipped away And left covered up in sand And how those days slipped by I'll still wonder why the angels let something so beautiful die My heart is crying, your kiss is lying It's something beautiful dyingDe Ville-Pomus Just hold me close and see me through the night So when tomorrow comes I'll have the strenght to fight, the strenght to fight That world outside, mmm that world outside Why can't two people alone find a place of their own So they don't give up in that world outside In that world outside, in that world outside You took all the broken pieces and made them whole You touched my body, you warmed my soul, you warmed my soul Our kind of love just knows no wrong or right It's like a mighty fire but our flame can never light Our flame can never light, that world outside, mmm that world outside Why can't two people alone find a place of their own So they don't give up in that world outside In that world outside, in that world outsideI was so proud Young and in love Head in the
