belong together, for eternity Eter..  eternityIn the sunlight of your smile In the summer of our life In the magic of love Storms above scattered away Lovers dreaming in the night Reaching for Paradise But as the dark shadows fade Love slips away On an empty stretch of beach In the pattern of the waves Drawing pictures with my hand In the sand, I see your face Skipping pebbles on the sea Wishing for Paradise Sand castles crumble below The restless tides ebb and flow Listening to a shell Hoping for your voice Beautiful Maria of my soul Though we'll always be apart Locked forever in a dream If I ever love again Even then, nothing will changeFrom out the dust Came a man true and bold Champion of the fandango By night he drank whiskey By day killed bad man And the townspeople knew him as Rango Comin' down the mountainside The people hailed his name And of his legend they sang-o With iron in his heart Steel in his claw He pumped their heads all full of lead Rango Rango, Rango Rango, Rango-o Rango A ladies man indeed, from his head down to his knees Rango was doing the tango But in came bad Bill from his hideout in the hill With a notion to kill RangoWell, come on let's go,

that he had seen A quiet voice is singing something to me An age old song about the home of the brave In this land here of the free One time one night in America A lady dressed in white with the man she loved Standing along the side of their pickup truck A shot rang out in the night Just when everything seemed right Another headline written down in America The guy that lived next door in #305 Took the kids to the park and disappeared About half past nine Who will ever know How much she loved them so That dark night alone in America A quiet voice is singing something to me An age old song about the home of the brave In this land here of the free One time one night in AmericaThrough the chill of winter Running across a frozen lake Hunters are out on his trail All odds are against him With a family to provide for The one thing he must keep alive Will the wolf survive Driftin' by the roadside Lines etched on an aging face Wants to make some honest pay Losing to the range war He's got two strong legs to guide him Two strong arms keep him alive Will the wolf survive Standing in the pouring rain All alone in a world that's changed Running scared, now forced to hide In a land where he once stood with pride But he'll find his way by the morning light Sounds across the nation Coming from your hearts and minds Battered drums and old guitars Singing songs of passion It's the truth that they all look for Something they must keep alive Will the wolf survive Will the wolf survive Oh Donna Oh Donna Oh Donna Oh Donna I had a girl, Donna was her name Since you left me  I've never been the same'Cause I love my girl Donna, oh, where can you be Where can you be Now that you're gone, I'm left all alone All by myself to wonder and roam'Cause I love my girl Donna, oh, where can you be Where can you be Well, darling, now that you're gone I don't know what I'll do'Cause I had all my love for you I had a girl, Donna was her name Since you left me, I've never been the same'Cause I love my girl Donna, oh, where can you be Where can you be
