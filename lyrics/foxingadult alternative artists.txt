I wrote you a letter Asked your best friend to send it But took to the sea before you could have read it Retreated to snowcapped waters of the unknown Extracted my heart while it was still beating But glowing and red And I swear that sweat would Envelop your arms if you broke down and held it I swear I'm a good man I swear I'm a good man So why don't you love me back So why don't you love me back Instead of twisting up words you just sat there in silence In wind burnt homes sighing rays from a sunset And all I could hear was the sound of the wasp nest My head made a home for the hum of the insects But my hands shake and shudder at the mention Of half-written reasons why we'll only be friends I swear I'm a good man I swear I'm a good man So why don't you love me back So why don't you love me back So why don't you love me back So why don't you love me back So why don't you love me back She says, "You always smell like cigarettes And there's always whiskey on your breath But you're the best that I can do And I, I think I love you."Now if you want me to slow down Just tell me to slow down Now if you want me to slow down Just tell me to slow down Because I want to be loved Because I want to be loved She says, "You don't love me you just love sex But I can't wait around for something better than this Because you're the best that I can do And I, I wish I could leave you."Now if you want me to slow down Just tell me to slow down Because I want to be loved Because I want to be loved Because I want to be loved Because I want to be lovedWe danced naked outside of your bathroom Until our bare feet sweat tracks on the tile As you came you moaned about loving them Such convenience in regret after the fact While our hitch breaths trip on false moves We both know we’ll be right here again So by now I know where the door is I’ll wait outside until you call me back in Future love, don’t fall apart Future love, don’t fall apart We purged on the milk of new treason As we clung to our warp weighted loom By the time we were done we were woven in Such constriction from a self made trap And on these antlers dry-rot cracks through I left myself too open for you So by now I know what decay is And I’ll lay on waves until the night channels end Future love, don’t fall apart Future love, don’t fall apart Future love, don’t fall apart Future love, don’t fall apartI want it all I'll watch the bridges all burn And I'll be your dog I'd be a darling for you Or anyone who wants me at all Does anybody want me at all 'Cause I'd sell my soul To be America's pool boy The crown centerfold My few good years left, a tribute To anyone who wants me at all Does anybody want me at all Oh, do you want me at all Do you want me at all Do you want me at all Aw, do you want me at all I've got it all I feel the love in suspension And nearer my god At hallowed ground, holding hands Ashing cigarettes on gravestones Pin photographs on cork boards Unfollowing my dead friends Someone's gonna love meI’m going down with the rosary Tongue pressed on guilt from a dove in my teeth I could watch it drip down and cover my skin The taste of Christ sits still while I swallow your insides I could let it drag you down to cover our sins If I could lift you off the ground they’d cry out that this is what love is When they unravel the webs that I’ve spun What shall be undone When they unravel the webs that I’ve spun What shall be undone Mother of God on the rosary So is she here with us Does she want what she sees Watch me come undone Watch me come undone When they unravel the webs that I’ve spun What shall be undone When God unravels the webs that I’ve spun What shall be undone I can be romantic When I'm starving for sleep When I try but I can't seem To remember anything With hair from a dog I’ve got a fistful of its mane It’s too coarse to stomach So I shove it down my throat Luck left late Saturday, and now…Jesus Christ, I'm wrecked to bed They watch me sleepin' in the kennel again I can't recall the bark, but the bay, I admit If I was listenin', I could hear it I’m shock-collared at the gates of Heaven25 years that I’ve been tryna shake loose And if I try to sit still Then someone's breathin' down my neck Oh, so I'm embarrassin' myself again I should see myself out Lay me down in the tub Throw away my phone Strap a muzzle to my mouth nowOh, pure heart's peer caught me gawking Your hair in the wind, such small lonesome hands I think I was meant to keep you warm It was bigger than me It was bigger than the sea And I'm not waving, I'm drowning I felt your waves calming comely Lights on as is angles casting sides Infinity and all watered the moon It was more than I could care I felt your waves calming comely Lights on as is angles casting sides Infinity and all watered the moon And I'm not waving, I'm drowning I felt your weights crushing contours And I felt cascades ripping right through me My brightest love sent from tundras Your Arctic touch My brightest love, it was more than I shared It was more than you caredMy bloodhound baying at your door The wild grass overlapping the front porch The sound of scratching claws trimmed short Keeps you buttoned up on the floor And you're reduced to howls And I'm not there to drown them out Swallowing up the room Letting yourself down Darling I'll be fine I've left behind my calluses I'll be whatever you like I'll be whatever you like Your seafaring love to the shore When the tide rolled in there was nothing left But an albatross hanging from my neck And just as you could not contain the sea You could not contain meAnd on tides we can’t be untouched by Of troubles stay when lids lay over eyes Frames and faces I’ve mistaken For kids whose lives I may have taken And if so, do I haunt their parents' dreams And in so, am I summarized by sounds of young lung screams Their young one's screams And of war bonds and blood stained hands Combat neurosis shys from indica strands And it breaks my mother’s heart to know I came back broken With the thought of my arms spilt open And if so, would I bring their parents peace And if so, could I give back the sounds of their children’s screams Let go of what I’ve seen And if so, do I haunt their parents' dreams And in so, am I summarized by sounds of young lung screams Their young one's screamsI walk around with a headglow Shrugging my shoulders Fucking up everything And they won't stop following me Holed up in a tower Sucking inheritance So mock up a thirty second TV corroborative defamation Now hold open the door so I can fall in So I'm on the floor with a halo Face in the carpet Laces in sheepshank With a hyena cackle from Vishnu Protection has ended You pay up to no thanks So you mock up an ad, gag a press pit The weather’s the same if you're born in '46 Now hold open the door so I can fall in Hold open the door so I can fall in Hold open the door so I can fall in Hold open the door so I can fall in
