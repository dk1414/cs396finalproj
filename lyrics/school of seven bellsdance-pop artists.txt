It hurts to know That you don't trust me When you try to bust me It only makes me trust you Less to know that I don't get respect When I've given you my word And you go with what you heard Instead you go and simmer through the night Then we end up in a fight And it's such a waste of time Now I know you're feeding me a line But you say that you're in love But you're stewing all the time I know you got a lot to question That made a big impression I know that you've been hurt for a while-why did you apologize When it was before my time is an answer I will give you And so when you call me on the phone And you hear I'm not alone No it doesn't mean that things have gone wrong There was a you before me There was a me before you And that's the way it goesOpen your eyes now All alone Open your eyes now Breathing I know that you were strong but life is moving on so Get it together cause now anger is your pleasure and That pleasure is a tether that fits you for too long Now you're thinking that you're better Cause you think it made you strong but What you don't get is the color of regret Is the thing that made you sweat When you tried to paint a picture of life Then the future when the present's still wet With the tears that you wiped long ago, feeling the fire still Keeping your head turned around in the past Float in the present with the role that you cast for her As the villain and you, who came in last It's time to wake up Open your eyes love Cause you've been sleeping It's getting hard to bear Watching you all alone I know your heart is broken And you've been weeping But I've been waiting here Patiently for too longHow could I have known The God of my youth would come Crashing down on my heart I thought that I knew love But love was a scornful thing That fed on the fading flame that held The world together for me And when it died I fell apart The day we met I was a new fire Whose heart had been Drowning for so long When I was dark You found a glowing ember And set my world Into a blaze again How could I forget You saw the stars in me when I Had sunk into the black You never thought to leave You were the drug to bring me out From a crushing sleep You told me all you saw was diamonds You told that until I believedI am neither breather or speaker I am neither walker or sleeper I am neither sister, brother, son, or daughter Solely in my chest is my heart, a drum of water I am under no disguise, I am under no disguise I am under no disguise, I am under no disguise I am under no disguise, I am under no disguise I am under no disguise, I am under no disguise I am neither breather or speaker I am neither walker or sleeper I am neither sister, brother, son, or daughter Solely in my chest is my heart, a drum of water I am under no disguise, I am under no disguise I am under no disguise, I am under no disguise I am under no disguise, I am under no disguise I am under no disguise, I am under no disguiseAfter the great flood, all washed away, I still stayed And through the crashing waves you'd promised me that you would wait 'cause I was the white light in your sad, desperate loneliness yet You left me swimming in circles as you rescued yourself Waking up so paralyzed Sunshine poured through the blinds Wishing I could shut my eyes Wishing I could just shut my eyes When you look back you'll turn into, this I promise you A pillar of salt that I'll walk through and I'll scatter you Into the wind back to the day we met where you'll settle into A standing pile of stones I'll skip across that ocean we knew One by one till there's nothing left of you One by one by one by one Bye bye byeYou hear it every time One day the tears will dry In time the pain subsides And then you start to live again I know you're asking why This seems to keep happening You give her everything To find yourself alone again If I could go through this pain For you I would I know I'd suffer through the same For you I could'Cause nothing in the world is worse Than watching you lose your faith No I can't think of someone who deserves Real love a thousand times more Real love A thousand times more Real love A thousand times more Real love A thousand times more Real loveI know you gotta, you gotta be on your own Who left you wanting, wanting to forget love That's alright cause all that I wanna do Is make you forget, forget that you feel so bad Give your heart a second to find the will again Put your sad down And tonight just feel with your body And tonight just feel with your body Put your sad down And tonight just feel with your body Put your sad down So baby no pressure I'm just talking pleasure And tonight just feel with your body So baby no pressure I'm just talking pleasure So baby no pressure I'm just talking pleasure So baby no pressure I'm just talking pleasure And tonight just feel with your body So baby no pressure I'm just talking pleasure So baby no pressure, put your sad down I'm just talking pleasure So baby no pressure I'm just talking pleasure And tonight just feel with your bodyDo you remember me Do you remember when in the morning hours How we would watch the stars play their song I would watch you pretend you were up on the screen Singing songs and I wish then you'd always find your dreams Someday know I didn't want to leave No, I never let you go Elias You are my little fire You lifted me from the dark When I was gonna die Elias Nothing as changed my time Even if you forget You'll always be My little fire I know it's hard to get I'll never understand why it turned out like this If I should see you when You've grown into the man I knew you'd be And hope to see the friend that you knew then Until then I dream of youMy cabal, he sleeps outside Pulling the shadows over the moonlight My cabal, won't you come inside Forget the darkness if just for one night Possibilities Baited with personal inconvenience Every time he feels That baited resistance tugging at his sleeve He struggles to find who He struggles to see why He's weary with a weight So often confused with authority But whose He sleeps outside Pulling the shadows over the moonlight I want to know why Paper is so different And what happens once these Promises incubated hit the air I want to know why the Air becomes so thick and impenetrable And why another set of rules apply, why These are the days With the sun we escape into night To the haze of the bright lights We become stars under gold painted eyes And are dreaming the template for our lives These are the kisses that burn on our lips Every time Every night We fall in love again This is the touch that remembers Tonight could be the end So let's go until the sunrise Our time is indestructible We are borderless lights in the sky We are gods tonight Eternal We own the night And when we come together We shake up the ground Underneath our feet No one can say we're too young To decide that we're gold We're the fires in the street
