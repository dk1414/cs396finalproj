Too soon, wanted more time Could've held out, but your clock was tickin'No easing in, straightened out lines Alone with your thoughts 'cause your friends are still in Night clubs and back rooms, baggies in the bathrooms Nothing's changed but you Sayin' nothing's missin,' thoughts are driftin' away from you The mornin' sun fills the void, now you see there never was a point Over and over and over again'Til you can no longer pretend you are sane Try but you couldn't get any more sure And the endin' still will never change Over and over and over again'Til you can no longer pretend you are sane Try but you couldn't get any more sure And the endin' still will never change Tomorrow night'll go on without you, go on without you there Tomorrow night'll go on without you 'til dawn an' no one will careYes, I'm only a man, judgments of something ancient Clockin' my time as finished the same is all replacements Ignorance is complacency, why I am purposely faded No stand, no sit, no stoppin', rippin' through the neon prophecies Got let off by a ticket stub, my time is fading fast Through your mouth and out your Say what  Come down For what  Pass it 'round Say what  For now I'll be around So I fear, but I don't know what it is So I want, but I pretend I don't need So here's the pain of the stop of a lover's kiss I throw my pages all away like shaking wrists So shake me down So shake me upDope in the wash, strangers in bed Dead-end nights make a heart beat half dead In the mirror, striking a pose Conjured up glamour in a school play rock show Guess it doesn't last forever, just a feeling to remember Dope on a rope we hang, the catwalk’s a plank Unless we turn around, and do it again Generations change In a blink the fad's extinct Find your lover or you'll flash the fame Before you wake up from your dream Everything changes when When the last call lights shine Seizing the heartbeat of our lovely reckless times Everything changes when When the last call lights shine Seizing the heartbeat of our lovely reckless times Collect taxidermy fist Smudges on your wrists New friends flood the list 'til you're sick Trying to have a ball in a tagged-up stall Numb when its from making sense of it all I guess it doesn't last forever Just a feeling to rememberOff work in the morning And up at the crack of dawn All my money worries Wherever I go come along Worry's a bully That just won't let me be Trying to keep me busy Tussling and struggling No home since the fire Me and the ash can't settle down Unsure of where I'm bound So I sink another round Placebo for pain And there's no one for to blame I refuse to accept That my work is all in vain Worry's a bully That just won't let me be Trying to keep me busy Tussling and struggling Still always remembering When the going gets tough That the labor of our love Will reward us soon enough Still always remembering When the going gets tough That the labor of our love Will reward us soon enoughChanges impend at the end of this prism The love sprouts from the decay The nights are pulsing, streets are convulsing Dark libations to the brave I stop trying to make sense of it all Start sniffing around the continous strife Grab fear by a strange hand Sweet neglection in her own right I wouldn't change her, trade or ditch I love her just the way she is All of her flaws and frizz Don't care what anybody says about her She has a spirit about mother nature You'll never know what she'll do Hardened from her mysterious sun I'm not a muse, I play the fool I stop trying to make sense of it all Start dancing around the continous strife Grab fear by a strange hand Keep her cool under the pale moonlightSince I don't know how you find love in L AThey don't make 'em like they do in the country The city moves too fast to appreciate all the time it takes for sweet loving Listen for fate's whisper It'll try and warn you Telling your heart to be cautious of a lover trying to harm you All the girls in L A look like they're fadin' away A woman should be strong with thick legs and big arms The stars in the sky, they put em on the street With the bums and the tramps, that nobody needs Listen for fate's whisper It'll try and warn you Telling your heart to be cautious of a lover trying to harm you You know they say it ain't easy lovin' the same woman forever Wish you luck on finding the good one on your heart's endeavor Nothing is easy Love isn't easy as it seems You can test a woman for honesty You can go and test her for goodness But it's a wicked game and a crying shame There's no way to give her a love testNo, they're not in love anymore They are stuck and afraid Don't worry babe Don't get too down on yourself They were in love when you were made His old boots finally wore out And the fire in his belly faded Her supple breast sadly sagged As her tender heart grew jaded A life of love is a long time When you know that it's only one time You were the reason they stuck around But you're old enough now Don't worry babe Not till you've been there too, will your world be less cruel The cold truth finally seeps out Until your memory is saturated Your fragile smile loses teeth and Your sparkling eyes grew faded A life of love is a long time When you know that it's only one timeI'm a dealer  with an infinite tab A gentleman in some of a sense She acts like I'm ripping up scabs No wonder she has no friends at all She's a lost cause so count your losses How's I supposed to know she'd ruin me Beauty strong enough to trick me Quick clouds a storm so moody Got me looking around in the Forbidden City She's the coldest, she's turning me silver She's got me on the bridge looking down at the old cold river She can hex like a crow She howls harder than the wind can blow Her love so uncomfortable She strikes down like a hammer on your,  big toe She's a lost cause so count your lossesDid I not show you a way out Beneath the veil you saw my vision wrapped in doubt You’re not my son and not my muse As you remind me, though I never thought this through Vices squeeze us till we’re blue, me and you That’s of no concern to me That don’t cause me misery It’s time, time’s what I can’t control, same as you Fear of going back to find All the nothingness we left behind Superstition is a hoax Though we both cannot seem to practice what we know Stepping over every crack Waiting for sweet life to break our bloodied backs Vices squeeze us till we’re blue, me and you That’s of no concern to me That don’t cause me misery It’s time, time’s what I can’t control, same as you Fear of going back to find All the nothingness we left behindPretending it'll get better When you're not around Finally free but I'm lying to me Searching for the black memories To show my heart what I need But nothing puts me at ease Where are you going Come back with my heart Sure as the wind keeps blowing Nothing's gonna heal these scars Broken promises you've given me Make me wanna live a life without words Expectations died before birth Trying to kill the pain before it hurts Where are you going Come back with my heart Sure as the wind keeps blowing Nothing's gonna heal these scars Prescribe me at ten times my weight In a vegetable state so they lock me away Pretending it'll get better When you're not around Finally free but I'm lying to me Where are you going Come back with my heart Sure as the wind keeps blowing Nothing's gonna heal these scars Where are you going Come back with my heart Sure as the wind keeps blowing Nothing's gonna heal these scars
