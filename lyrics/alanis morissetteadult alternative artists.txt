Hey, yeah, yeah Yeah, ah-ah-ah, yeah, hey An old man turned ninety-eight He won the lottery and died the next day It's a black fly in your Chardonnay It's a death row pardon two minutes too late And isn't it ironic Don't you think It's like rain on your wedding day It's a free ride when you've already paid It's the good advice that you just didn't take And who would've thought  It figures Mr  Play-It-Safe was afraid to fly He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye He waited his whole damn life to take that flight And as the plane crashed down He thought, "Well, isn't this nice "I'm broke, but I'm happy I'm poor, but I'm kind I'm short, but I'm healthy, yeah I'm high, but I'm grounded I'm sane, but I'm overwhelmed I'm lost, but I'm hopeful, baby And what it all comes down to Is that everything's gonna be fine, fine, fine'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket And the other one is givin' a high five I feel drunk, but I'm sober I'm young, and I'm underpaid I'm tired, but I'm working, yeah I care, but I'm restless I'm here, but I'm really gone I'm wrong, and I'm sorry, baby And what it all comes down to Is that everything's gonna be quite all right'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket And the other one is flickin' a cigaretteI want you to know, that I'm happy for you I wish nothing but the best for you both An older version of me, is she perverted like me Would she go down on you in a theatre Does she speak eloquently  And would she have your baby I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother'Cause the love that you gave that we made Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no And every time you speak her name Does she know how you told me You'd hold me until you died  'Til you died But you're still alive And I'm here to remind you Of the mess you left when you went away It's not fair, to deny me Of the cross I bear that you gave to me You, you, you oughta know You seem very well, things look peaceful I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know Did you forget about me Mr  Duplicity I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced And are you thinkin' of me when you fuck her And down came your innocence A shining badge, a suit to match Bit my nails down so they wouldn't scratch But who believes with knees like these I'll take two of 'em, please With soft skin, soft eyes All these beautiful laughs and beautiful thighs They always kept me up at night But I can't change my appetite'Cause your pussy is a wonderland And I could be a better man It doesn't matter to me Your pussy is a wonderland And I could be a better man It doesn't matter to me'Cause he is she is her And her and he are love And I have never felt the difference'Cause he is she is her And her and he are love Tired of all these labelsHow 'bout getting off of these antibiotics How 'bout stopping eating when I'm full up How 'bout them transparent dangling carrots How 'bout that ever elusive kudo Thank you India Thank you terror Thank you disillusionment Thank you frailty Thank you consequence Thank you, thank you silence How 'bout me not blaming you for everything How 'bout me enjoying the moment for once How 'bout how good it feels to finally forgive you How 'bout grieving it all one at a time Thank you India Thank you terror Thank you disillusionment Thank you frailty Thank you consequence Thank you, thank you silenceFirst thing that you'll notice is some separation from each other Yes, it's a lie, we've been believing since time immemorial There was an apple, there was a snake, there was division There was a split, there was a conflict in the fabric of life One became two, and then everyone was out for themselves Everyone was pitted against each other, conflict ruled the realm All our devotions and temperaments are pulled from different wells We seem to easily forget we are made of the same cells To my boy All that energy, so vital Love your hues and your blues in equal measure Your comings and your goings-away My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablaze Second thing you'll notice is that often we think that there's not enough It might feel dark, it might feel lonely and you'll wonder why you're here You'll be overcome with darkness and a sense of hopelessness But it won't matter if you keep the core connected to the oneness To my girl All your innocence and fire When you reach out, I am here hell or high water This nest is never going away My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablazeLike anyone would be I am flattered by your fascination with me Like any hot blooded woman I have simply wanted an object to crave But you, you're not allowed You're uninvited An unfortunate slight Must be strangely exciting To watch the stoic squirm Must be somewhat heartening To watch shepherd meet shepherd But you, you're not allowed You're uninvited An unfortunate slight Like any uncharted territory I must seem greatly intriguing You speak of my love like You have experienced love like mine beforeI had no choice but to hear you You stated your case, time and again I thought about it You treat me like I'm a princess I'm not used to liking that You ask how my day was You've already won me over In spite of me And don't be alarmed if I fall Head over feet And don't be surprised if I love you For all that you are I couldn't help it It's all your fault Your love is thick And it swallowed me whole You're so much braver Than I gave you credit for That's not lip service You've already won me over In spite of me And don't be alarmed if I fall Head over feet And don't be surprised if I love you For all that you are I couldn't help it It's all your faultDo I stress you out My sweater is on backwards and inside out And you say, "How appropriate!"I don't wanna dissect everything today I don't mean to pick you apart, you see But I can't help it And there I go jumping before the gunshot has gone off Slap me with the splintered ruler And it would knock me to the floor if I wasn't there already If only I could hunt the hunter And all I really want is some patience A way to calm the angry voice And all I really want is deliverance Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah Do I wear you out You must wonder why I'm relentless and all strung out I'm consumed by the chill of solitary I'm like Estella I like to reel it in and then spit it out I'm frustrated by your apathyI recommend getting your heart trampled on to anyone Yeah, oh I recommend walkin' around naked in your living room Yeah Swallow it down It feels so good Wait until the dust settles You live, you learn You love, you learn You cry, you learn You lose, you learn You bleed, you learn You scream, you learn I recommend biting off more than you can chew to anyone I certainly do I recommend sticking your foot in your mouth at any time Feel free Throw it down Hold it up You wait and see when the smoke clears
