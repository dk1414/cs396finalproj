never felt so low I want to turn and run We've got to find a place to go So when you're feeling kind of mixed up Just remember it's a mixed up world And if you're feeling life is just too tough Just remember you're a real tough girlDowntown's been caught by the hysteria The people scream and shout A generation's on the move When disco spreads like a bacteria The lonely days are out Welcome the passion of the groove The golden years, the silver tears You wore a tie like Richard Gere I wanna get down, you spin me around I stand on the borderline Crying at the discotheque Crying at the discotheque I saw you crying I saw you crying at the discotheque I saw you crying I saw you crying at the discotheque Tonight's the night at danceteria The joining of the tribe The speakers pumping clear and loud The way you move is our criteria Let the D J takes you high And tears of joy baptize the crowdThere's a look in your eye That says you want to be carefree tonight Just like in days gone by When we were wild Darling, I'm not so uptight And I can still put my mind on the flip side'Cause I'm not so resigned to a mundane life Why be so ordinary, why just conform Let's rip the night in half and forget it all So keep the engine running under the stars I feel release is coming, tonight it's ours We shouldn't fight the way we feel When it comes from somewhere real A garden always in full bloom That's how I think of me and you And if escape is what we need When it comes to you and me We should just surrender Stay wild forever It's like a secret we hold And the adventures we go on are untold You've got to lose yourself To find your way back homeI know you're feeling restless Like life's not on your side It's weighing heavy on your mind But when we stand united Our hearts, they beat in time I know we'll make it all alright Let's bring it back to you and me There's no one else around Don't get lost in gravity'Cause I want you to hold me now Nothing else matters It's just the two of us And if it all falls down Nothing else matters You know we're strong enough I'm not giving up, I'm not giving up on us I said I'm not giving up, I'm not giving up on love'Cause I feel it inside Taking over tonight I'll be there when the storm is breaking In this moment I'm yours You can always be sure That together we're gonna make it
