And all I am is a man I want the world in my hands I hate the beach but I stand In California with my toes in the sand Use the sleeves of my sweater Let's have an adventure Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered Touch my neck and I'll touch yours You in those little high waisted shorts, oh She knows what I think about And what I think about One love, two mouths One love, one house No shirt, no blouse Just us, you find out Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no'Cause it's too cold for you here And now, so let me hold Both your hands in the holes of my sweater And if I may just take your breath away I don't mind if there's not much to say Sometimes the silence guides a mind To move to a place so far away The goosebumps start to raise The minute that my left hand meets your waist And then I watch your face Put my finger on your tongue'Cause you love the taste, yeah These hearts adore Everyone the other beats hardest for Inside this place is warm Outside, it starts to pourTake you like a drug I taste you on my tongue You ask me what I'm thinking about I tell you that I'm thinking about Whatever you're thinking about Tell me somethin' then I'll forget And you might have to tell me again It's crazy what you do for a friend Go ahead and cry, little girl Nobody does it like you do I know how much it matters to you I know that you got daddy issues And if you were my little girl I'd do whatever I could do I'd run away and hide with you I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too I tried to write your name in the rain But the rain never came So I made with the sun The shade Always comes at the worst times Take me to your place Let's skip the foreplay Hey, you ask me what I’m thinking about I tell you that I'm thinking about us And this is how the story begins I'll never tell this story again’Til one of us is making amends Go ahead and cry, little girl Nobody does it like you do I know how much it matters to you I know that you got daddy issues And if you were my little girl I'd do whatever I could do I'd run away and hide with you I know that you got daddy issues Daddy stuck around but he wasn't present Cheated on your mom but she never left him First I didn't get it, now I understand He broke her heart, left money in her hands So everything got paid for She made sure you and your brother had way more Than she ever had growing up But when you told me the whole story, I felt like throwing up I could see it on your face, it was rough Left a bad taste on your tongue And she didn't even take any drugs She would rain all day, couldn't wait for her sun to shine And you made it shine There when she cried, you saved her lifeR.I.P  to my youth And you could call this the funeral I'm just telling the truth And you can play this at my funeral Wrap me up in Chanel inside my coffin Might go to Hell and there ain't no stopping Might be a sinner and I might be a saint I'd like to be proud but somehow I'm ashamed Sweet little baby in a world full of pain I gotta be honest, I don't know if I could take it Everybody's talkin' but what's anybody saying Mama said if I really want it, then I can change it, yeah R.I.P  to my youth If you really listen, then this is to you Mama, there is only so much I can do Tough for you to witness but it was for me too I'm using white lighters to see what's in front of me R.I.P  to my youth And you could call this the funeral I'm just telling the truth, yeah You can play this at my funeral Tell my sister don't cry and don't be sad I'm in paradise with Dad Close my eyes and then cross my arms Put me in the dirt, let me dream with the stars Throw me in a box with the oxygen off You gave me the key and you locked every lock When I can't breathe, I won't ask you to stop When I can't breathe, don't call for a cop I was naive and hopeful and lost Now I'm aware and trapped in my thoughts, woahWhen I wake up, I'm afraid Somebody else might take my place When I wake up, I'm afraid Somebody else might take my place Make that money, fake that dummy, ache my tummy On the fence, all the time Paid junk honey, your face so sunny, ain't that funny All my friends always lie to me, I know they're thinking You're too mean, I don't like you Fuck you, anyway You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs It hurts but, I won't fight you You suck, anyway You make me want to die, right when I When I wake up, I'm afraid Somebody else might take my place When I wake up, I'm afraid Somebody else might take my place When I wake up, I'm afraid Somebody else might take my place When I wake up, I'm afraid Somebody else might end up being meIf I told you that I loved you Tell me, what would you say If I told you that I hated you Would you go away Now I need your help with everything that I do I don't want to lie, I've been relying on you Fallin' again I need a pick-me-up I've been callin' you "friend,"I might need to give it up I'm sick, and I'm tired too I can admit, I am not fireproof I feel it burning me I feel it burning you I hope I don't murder me I hope I don't burden you If I do, If I do If I meet you in the middle, maybe we could agree You make me feel little how you're looking at me And you can throw me shade, all it does is just cool me off First it just threw me off, now I'm just moving onI think I talk too much I need to listen, baby I need to listen, baby I need to listen good I think I try too hard How I look, what I do, what I'm sayin'I spend too much time explainin' myself I hope there's some time to change it I can taste it, my heart's breakin', please don't say That you know, when you know I can't take it, I'm impatient, tell me, baby Now I know, you should go I know I'll fall in love with you, baby And that's not what I wanna do I hope you won't ever lie to me And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby I think I worry a lot I need to take it easy I've got this anxious feeling But it goes away for a minute when I'm with you, breathingI don't know if we should be alone together I still got a crush, that's obvious If nobody's around, what's stopping us Everywhere I go you show whatever I don't ever mind sharing oxygen I just wanna get lost in your lungs Just a baby, but she's growing up so fast And I'm allergic to the waiting She's just a baby girl And I love to watch her dance But it's making me go crazy Can you let your baby be my girl Can you let your baby be my girl Can you let your baby be my girl Can you let your baby be mine I don't think that we should be around each other When you're in the room, you get my eyes You open your mouth, I'm hypnotized I can make you laugh until you cry You know you got all my attention You know you got all mineWe talked about making it I'm sorry that you never made it And it pains me just to hear you have to say it You knew the game and played it It kills to know that you have been defeated I see the wires pulling while you're breathing You knew you had a reason It killed you like diseases And I can hear it in your voice while you're speaking You can't be treated Mr  Know-it-all had his reign and his fall At least that's what his brain is telling all If he said "help me kill the president"I'd say he needs medicine Sick of screaming "let us in"The wires got the best of him All that he invested in goes Straight to hell, straight to hell Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh Straight to hell, straight to hell Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh He told me I should take it in, listen to every word he's speaking The wires getting older, I can hear the way they're creaking As they're holding him, well, I could see it in his jaw That all he ever wanted was a job He tells me to be raw Admits to every little flaw That never let him sit upon the top Won't tell me to stop Thinks that I should be a little cautious Well, I can tell the wires pulledYou've been my muse for a long time You get me through every dark night I'm always gone, out on the go I'm on the run and you're home alone I'm too consumed with my own life Are we too young for this Feels like I can't move Sharing my heart It's tearing me apart But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now Doing what I can, tryna be a man And every time I kiss you, baby I can hear the sound of breaking down I've been confused as of late Watching my youth slip away You're like the sun, you wake me up But you drain me out if I get too much I might need room or I'll break
