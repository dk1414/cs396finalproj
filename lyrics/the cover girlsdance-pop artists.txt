You say that you really love me I'm always on your mind And you say I should be your lover And we should spend some time But I'm not persuaded that quickly My heart has been broken before you see So if you want to be my lover You have to prove your love is true to me Cause it's easy To tell me you love me Easy to say You're thinking of me Words are so easy to say Show me, show me You really love me Actions speak louder than words Show me, show me You really need me Cause all those lies I've already heard Show me, show me You really love me Let me believe that it's trueI'm wishing on a star To follow where you are I'm wishing on a dream To follow what it means I'm wishing on a star To follow where you are I'm wishing on a dream To follow what it means And I wish on all the rainbows That I see I wish on all the people Who really dream And I'm wishing on tomorrow Praying it'll come And I'm wishing on all the lovin'We've ever done I never thought I'd see A time when you would be So far away from home So far away from me Just think of all the moments That we spent I just can't let you go For me, you were meantYesterday, I met a boy so fine Right away I knew He'd captivate my mind So strong The kind you dream about Baby, together We could really turn it out I showed him to Some friends of mine They said, girl Don't waste your time That boy's no good for you Listen, girl I'm telling you I think it's time you knew that All that glitters isn't gold Everything you see isn't what it seems to be Oh, no All that glitters isn't goldFor so long I kept these feelings for you locked up inside And there were nights that I would cry myself to sleep and wonder why Now I don't wanna tell you how to live Don't wanna put the blame But don't you think It's time for you and I To try to make a change We can't go wrong We can't go wrong We can't go wrong If the love we have is real We can't go wrong There was a time when things were better Than the way they are today But we forgot the vows we made And love got lost along the wayI used to walk home all alone It used to be so sad I used to be all by myself It used to be so bad Until you You came along And took me by the hand Until you You came along And said that you would be my man Now I'm jumping up and down Spinning all around Because of you, babe I'm as happy as can be And it's definitely Because of you babe Just because of you I used to go to bed at night Wishing I had a friend Someone to hold and squeeze me tight A very special friendDon't tell me that you're not a dancer I've been watching you I'm not taking no for an answer Picture what we could do No, no, casanova Baby don't be shy You've got the ways to win me over All you got to do is try Don't stop know, now that you've got me started It's the perfect night, so right for love Don't stop now, leave me broken hearted We've come this far, baby don't stop now I can tell that you feel the music when I'm holding you If you want me go on and prove it What have we got to lose We could take it slow All things come in time I've been around enough to know I'm ready to cross that line Chorus It's been so very long Since you held me in your arms this way And all this time that you've been gone I've thought about you each and every day So now you've returned And you want to try our love again But frankly I'm concerned That you will hurt Like you did then What you must do To prove your love is true Is give me a guarantee That you'll love me through and through Promise me That this time love will stay Promise me That you'll never go awayInside, outside Inside, outside Inside and out When I first met you, boy I would not give you a play Your reputation as a playboy scared me away But you persisted and You captured me with all your charms And you insisted that The place for me was in your arms But now things have changed But now things have changed You're acting strange Got me so confused I just can't take it anymore You got me inside, outside Spinning all around Every time I look for you You're nowhere to be foundCome on down To the funk boutique Try on a groove With a funky rhythm Yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah Funky rhythm It's a funky rhythm Funky rhythm Funky rhythm Yeah, yeah Funky rhythm It's a funky rhythm Funky rhythm Funky rhythm Oh, oh, oh...Oh, oh, oh..
