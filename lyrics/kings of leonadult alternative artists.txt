Lay where you're layin'Don't make a sound I know they're watchin'They're watchin'All the commotion The kiddie-like play It has people talkin'Talkin'You!Your sex is on fire The dark of the alley The breakin' of day Ahead while I'm drivin'I'm drivin'Soft lips are open Them knuckles are pale Feels like you're dyin'You're dyin'You!Your sex is on fire Consumed!With what's just transpiredI've been roamin' around, always lookin' down at all I see Painted faces fill the places I can't reach You know that I could use somebody You know that I could use somebody Someone like you and all you know and how you speak Countless lovers under cover of the street You know that I could use somebody You know that I could use somebody Someone like you Off in the night, while you live it up I'm off to sleep Wagin' wars to shape the poet and the beat I hope it's gonna make you notice I hope it's gonna make you notice Someone like me Someone like me Someone like me Somebody I'm ready now I'm ready now I'm ready now I'm ready now I'm ready now I'm ready now I'm ready nowI can't get there on my own You can't leave me here alone I’m just trying to do what’s right Oh a man ain't a man 'less he's fought the fight I could never point you out Waste of space in a faceless crowd Tell me what I have to say If you know what’s right, then you’ll walk away When the walls come down When the walls come down When the walls come down When the walls come down One by one I've seen em fall Some just don’t show up at all I’m just here to fight the fire Oh a man ain’t a man 'less he has desire And the walls come down And the walls come down When the walls come down When the walls come downAll the way from Waco to We Ho with a rabbit on her chain Drove a little slick car to tend bar with the static on her brain She's a little burner, burner, gonna throw you to the flame Little ticking time bomb, time bomb, gonna blow us all away Oh, take the time to waste a moment Oh, never ask to be forgiven Tex, he was her boyfriend with no kin always running from the law Every other weekend, the week ends with his back in her claw He's a livewire, wired, shooting sparks in the night He’s a gun for a hire, hired with a bead in his sights Oh, take the time to waste a moment Oh, facing where the lines are broken Oh, name your price to all this living Oh, never ask to be forgiven Oh, take the time to waste a moment Oh, face it where the lines are broken Oh, name a price to all that's living Oh, never ask to be forgivenStranded in this spooky town Stop lights are swaying and the phone lines are down Floor is crackling cold She took my heart, I think she took my soul With the moon I run Far from the carnage of the fiery sun Driven by the strangle of vein Showing no mercy, I'd do it again Open up your eyes You keep on crying, baby, I'll bleed you dry Skies are blinking at me I see a storm bubbling up from the sea And it's coming closer And it's coming closer You who shimmy shook my bone Leaving me stranded all in love on my own Do you think of me Where am I now  Baby, where do I sleep Feels so good, but I'm old Two thousand years of chasing taking it's tollSingle book of matches, gonna burn what's standing in the way Roaring down the mountain, now they're calling on the fire brigade Bury all the pictures, and tell the kids that I'm okay If I'm forgotten, they'll remember me for today I, I won't ever be your cornerstone I, I don't wanna be here holding on All the black inside of me, is slowly seeping from the bone Everything I cherish, is slowly dying or it's gone Little shaken babies and drunkards seem to all agree Once the show gets started it's bound to be a sight to see I, I won't ever be your cornerstone I, I don't wanna be here holding on I, I won't ever be your cornerstone IWatch her roll, can you feel it Watch her roll, can you feel it Watch her roll, can you feel it Watch her roll, can you feel it Get back on track Pick me up some bottles of booze Fickle freshman Probably thinks she's cooler than you A hay ride at 5 Everybody's coming around So go press your skirt Word is there's a new girl in town I call shotgun You can play your R&B tunes The fellowship time It always comes a little too soon The land of the creeps Freshened up from baby faced shave Put your eyes on me And I know a place that we can get away, ay Just say I want you Just exactly like I used to'Cause baby this is oooo-only bringing me downBite your tongue Don't make a scene, dear Everybody's been here least once before We've been here more Your heart breaks Rolls down the window I've seen it all go, come back around And I've heard the sound The tip of your tongue The top of your lungs is doing my head in I say, "Love, don't mean nothing Unless there's something worth fighting for."It's a beautiful war When I hold The warmth of your body There is nobody that I'd rather hold Shattered and cold The tip of your tongue The top of your lungs is making me crazy I say, "Love, don't mean nothing Unless there's something worth fighting for."It's a beautiful warMy motivation is gone too soon The good vibrations all over you Act like you mean it You mean it You've got a story you never tell Down in the delta, you're ringing bells I've never seen it Seen it Back of my mind, I'm on my way I see through smiles on every face I don't believe it Believe it'Cause I'm the supersoaker Red, white and blew 'em all away With a kiss as unclean as the words that you say I don't mind sentimental girls at times Mr  Walker away Walker away Your flags are flying across the plains I got a secret picking in my brain I wanna see you See you The exit sign is on my face Don't know my home, I don't know my place I just wanna be there Be thereCut open my heart Right at the scar And loosen up Gonna do what I'm told Go where I'm told And loosen up Take a shot in the rain One for the pain And loosen up I tried all the way Wait for me, wait for me It's all better now, it's all better now Wait for me, wait for me Going to soften the blow Soften the blow And give it up I saw the surprise The look in your eyes I gave it up Gonna be who I am Be who I am And give it up
