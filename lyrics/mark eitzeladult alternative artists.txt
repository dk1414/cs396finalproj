Come on dance with me right here Right here in your merciful kitchen Let all the sorrow disappear While our feet go missing Under your soft Christmas lights Who would ever reap what they sow Dancing's the only thing I do right As long as we keep it nice and slow And you’re always on my mind I just can’t leave you behind You make me want to stick around and find If there’s an answer Don’t know how I got so broken If you wanna leave what can I say Sing a hymn for all things left unspoken A song called “Dance the Night Away”And you’re always on my mind I just can’t leave you behind You make me want to stick around and find If there’s an answer If there’s an answerThe ferryman Who takes me to my rest He don’t give a damn Who’s cursed or blessed Anyway, I give him all my cash I'm like some tragic hero A lightning flash Followed by a million zeros I spent the last ten years, yeah Trying to waste half an hour Every drunk is that V IP Who only lives inside a rope Where they show you all the love Make mine a bourbon and coke I’m not lying, Mr  Ferryman I always make it home Though my house is built on sand It ain't worth the loan I spent the last ten years, yeah Trying to waste half an hour So I had that real good time And then in the dawn I saw the bartender’s love I saw it in a yawn Mr  Ferryman Do you party where you’re from Do you know where to go When the party's all done Let's go toast the twilight at the old horror house It's a graveyard, the music's loud, the future's bleak And we'll say hi to Lead Pipe Books the bands, says he's free Squeals like a pig when forced to speak The speaker stack is covered in a thick pile of dust Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up Give me something I can use I wanna get messed up, and give up, and end up somewhere else Sometimes, you don't wanna choose It's a plywood stage and the carpets are rotten The band is so loud they're lighter than air The singer's heart and soul had long since been bled And like the ocean, well, she didn't care The music, it was blasting And i couldn't hear what she said Oh, but when she signed my poster She wrote I love you She wrote I love you She wrote I love you But you're dead The guitar was pure evil, like the engines on a jet The singer is beautiful and oh, so, bored When she started crawling around on the ground well, honey, you bet I've been down on that beer-soaked floorI'm the sad clown that sings I'm the bad wine the good guest brings Too self-absorbed for magic My car is always stuck in traffic I sleep in an airless cell I got a rich and deep private hell Oh why are you with me Oh why are you with me I'm white as a lie I used to say I was bi Always ready to strike out or hurt Plus I never take off my shirt I am always chewing empty bowls And plates of cheese and toast I claim my music is in demand I even went to Stonehenge with my band And I knew from the start That you could break my heart You don't laugh at all my jokes But you wear all my coats I knew from the start That you could break my heart'Cause with you nothing's wrong'Cause you're where I belong I knew from the start That you could break my heartThe night falls like a chain Nothing and everything Takes the blood from your vein Nothing and everything His lightning bolt hands Only fill the room with ash Makes impossible demands Accepts credit cards or cash Won’t suffer your confession Less you bend to his will Relies on your compassion To always get the bill The chain weighs a ton Nothing and everything Freedom’s a gun It’s nothing and everything And because you love him You’re the punching bag He’s just a big child It’s just a game of tag When he reaches for you Like a demon from a spell Hopes drown in their blood Wishes die in the wellThe carpenter went to his dark place again Mouth full of gravy and turkey and truth Only hears you when you say amen So heavy is his burden of proof Said his enemies he always outfoxes So many dark forces at play So many carpenters building little boxes In the faded glory U SA When you look at me I look away I told him well I guess in my role As a professional singer and ham Instead of a cane I’ve got a broken soul And it’s with the deaf and dumb I stand God bless your coldhearted causes Your cartoons and curses are a bore Your eyes aglow like stolen watches The righteous so eager for war When you look at me I look awayI wish that we were always high I wish that we could swim around the sky They say if you believe then you won't fall We'll leave these messy lives and rise above it all You never love if you never trust How do we love when you fall like dust I'll be the match that holds your fire I'll be the note that sings from your wire If I can give you all my love The light we use when we get lost The light we choose and never mind the cost Well that's what we hope to see in each other's eyes It's what we hope to feel on our highest highs If I can give you all my love, all my love All my love Mmm, all my love All my love All my loveWhat is it with you How come good luck Only makes you cruel You get dead-eyed as royalty And just as blue But you know I don’t care I don’t care what you do I just wanna know Where you are, what is true But just because someone loves you Doesn’t mean you can treat them bad But just because someone loves you Doesn’t mean they can be had Don’t wanna kill your soul You know that’s not for me I don’t put my hands over your eyes You should be able to see Just because someone loves you Doesn’t mean you can count them out Just because someone loves you Doesn’t mean you can make them doubtWe’re on a drive that’s never over To play for a barman and his hateful brother Who sit at the bar not even trying It’s that kind of night when no one’s buying And we fall between the lines Staying true, trusting every sign But we know There’s no end To the road To shake the room to fill the air That’s all we have, that’s what there is Cause in a song it’s so clear The heart of the world drawing near And for the song there’s always more Than you have there’s always more And you know There’s no end To the road Win or lose, the music’s right We’ll lose the war to win the fight We’re soldiers proud who still believe The war is worth the friends we leaveLa Llorona knew love Her heart spilled like wine Her laugh could shatter glass Always brought the real good time But she loved her men too much And they loved to misbehave She was the lightning strike That makes the thunder brave But if you shine too bright You vanish in the glare You lose your light Like you were never there She was lost in love Lost and found The faggot, the junkie The runaround She let one use her to hide behind Let one use her to hide his pain Let one use her just for fun To be a pawn in everyone’s game And that turned her dreams to ash Like a footprint on the moon Shattered dreams don’t fade In a desecrated tomb
