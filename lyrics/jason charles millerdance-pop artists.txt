I've haunted these halls from time to time Captured cycle breakers, committed dark crimes And Lost Ones, I've processed a few I've had my share of ink splashed in my face, but I ain't gonna lose We are the Keepers of Wilson And we'll keep defending the machine We are the Keepers We are the Keepers No time for heroes'Causе, we are the Keepеrs of the machineI want you to be happy, I want you to be safe And if we can't be either then I'll toast you in the grave I'm hanging with the Phoenix, as we travel 'cross the land Thwarting lots of evil with a cast of Burning Hands So let's take it one problem at a time If we band together there's no mountain we won't climb So gather 'round the fire my friends and sing another line Let's celebrate together 'til we all run out of rhymes Hey Hеy Hey Hey I'll heal you with my firе, I'll catch you with my wings And when it gets real dire I'll Death Ward all the things My friends are like marshmallows, flammable and sweet I try hard not to burn them when I'm bringin on the heat So let's take it one problem at a time If we band together there's no mountain we won't climb So gather 'round the fire my friends and sing another line Let's celebrate together 'til we all run out of rhymesSoaked by winter rains I stumbled to the gate Seeking out my fortune I was running from my fate Walking after sunset Searching for the love I haven't met My days, they fade away But my heart it yearns to stay Neverwinter nights Neverwinter dreams Always shining bright Never what it seems He stood there before me As I wandered down the street Among a bed of flowers In the garden that he keeps He smilеd as I walked up My heart it skipped a bеat Like a moth to a flame I was drawn to the heatStarted on the wrong foot, on the wrong side of the wagon tracks The only place I've called home is a place I'm never goin' back Headed down the Sword Coast, with my dreams all tied up in my pack Woah Guided by my empty pockets, aimless but forever free Made my way to Waterdeep, got a job placed right in front of me New friends by my side, we ride toward our destiny Woah, woah Deal me in Shuffle the deck Deal me in I'll call your bet I'm goin' all in I'll risk it all No matter how hard I fall Ventured out into the jungle, hunting for an ancient city Tracking down a Chultan cultist, listening to pirate ditties Fought our way through zombie hordes, it sure wasn't pretty WoahOnce upon a time there was a man who wore a smirk He stormed the North, he sallied forth and acted like a jerk Tired of the battles and his work as sword for hire He left for Waterdeep and then decided to retire He's the Moneylender, Mirt He turned his chase for power to the kind you wield in town And now his name is known and feared by everyone around He went and joined the Harpers then he opened up a bank Lending treasure near and far to those who's fortune's sank He's the Moneylender, Mirt Hitch your wagon, raise a flagon, tell a bawdy tale'bout a man so merciless that he would drink up all of your ale But then one day he changed his ways and opened up his purse I can think of many ways that could be worse He's the moneylender Mirt Lord Walrus and the Wanderer were tired of growing old They went to Undermountain and came out with lots of gold!When they both emerged they had a lot of work to do They built the Yawning Portal and another mansion, too He's the Moneylender, MirtI serve this master on my own I cling to no one, I just roam The Dark Order calls and I do ride Cut across the ground like a devil's knife Legions rise up at my command Slaying our foes across the land And for my master I will die But not before I take your life Upon my fiery blades will be your lifesblood stains The pounding drums of war will be this songs refrain I am pure savagery and primal rage untamed I am a conqueror in Her unholy name Reckless anger Savage fire Dark tower reaches to the sky Ancient dragons circling high Standing below we wage our war For the queen of dragonkind forevermoreHush little children and lay down your head While we tell you a story of unending dread'Bout a creature of fire, a creature at war A prince among demons, sinister to the core Listen close to my words now as you snuggle in tight Of this two-headed monster who devours the night Aameul longs to break free, inflicting horror and pain And Hethradiah seeks nothing but destruction to reign When the gazes turn upon, it brings madness There is nothing that can save you from their malice Demogorgon, With their balеful gaze Will devour the world at thе end of all days Demogorgon, The Sibilant Beast Our whole multiverse shall be their feast Demogorgon, Prince of the Abyss Demogorgon, deep within the pits Discarded, forgotten, and left for dead The Imprisoned One grew, as their evil spread When the night comes upon you at the end of the day Keep your eyes shut tight, don't you dare disobeyAt the edge of thought, where screams fade to whispers Where secrets are sought, knowledge crumbles and blisters Where the Undying King sees time drifting by Don't let your mind wander into his eye What is your truth, what brings your corruption What will he find that ensures your destruction God in shackles, he'll break every one Seeking power 'til death is undone He's the Lord of Secrets, the Whispered One He will bring about the setting sun Spreading vile darkness for all to know The shadow of the eye and hand only grow Embrace the lore and spurn the light Walk with him in the darkness of night You will feel his icy touch of death He will steal your final breath He's the Lord of Secrets, the Whispered One He will bring about the setting sun Spreading vile darkness for all to know The shadow of the eye and hand only growKnight of the Black Rose Breaker of his oaths Assassin of his blood Soul forever judged Damned by love's last breath To linger in undeath Cursed by his own deeds To live eternally As the years go by As all live and die Lord Soth Unforgiven sin Lord Soth Rotting from deep within Lord Soth His blame he'll never own Lord Soth His hatred is always sown Lord Soth Armor shining bright'Til blood stained the knight Roses' jagged thorns Pierce the knight once more Crimson shining bright Shadows consume the light Worlds pay for his sin His judgment never endsOvercast, underneath the moonlight A shadow creeps at the edge of sight Pockets picked, be it noble or knight All gold shines the same under lamplight A lady of charm, a lady of skill Picking your pockets, going in for the kill A lady of style, a lady of class Dancing a ball or kicking your ass Feel the bitter bite, of the Viper's Fangs tonight Did you hear about that theft, so brash So bold and brazen, done with such panache I heard it was Black Viper on a crime spree But I'm a little parched, please pass the tea A lady of charm, a lady of skill Picking your pockets, going in for the kill A lady of style, a lady of class Dancing a ball or kicking your ass Feel the bitter bite, of the Viper's Fangs tonight
