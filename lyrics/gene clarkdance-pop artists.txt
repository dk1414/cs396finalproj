There's been some misunderstanding And I'd like to make it right Both of us need inspiration And the timing must be right We all have soul Yet nobody knows Just how much it takes to fly But I see my life before me And I'd like to make a try Maybe someone knows what fate is Maybe someone knows just why All I know is, it's all related Maybe someone can explain time But I know if you sell your soul To brighten your role You might be disappointed in the lights We all need a fix at a time like this But doesn't it feel good to stay aliveAll alone you say That you don't want no other So the Lord is love And love is like no other If the falling tide Can turn and then recover All alone we must Be part of one another All alone you say The power is perfection Is the power peace Or merely the connection To the God of Love That powers the protection From the tide of life That flows in each direction When the stream of changing days Turns around in so many ways Then the pilot of the mind Must find the right directionSome walk out winners of those who've lost Can it be said at any price this is the cost Hard is perception, easier is blame Is this the only life for everyone Is it the same Children laugh and run away While others look into the darkness of the day Some streets are easy while some are cruel Could these be reasons why man is life's greatest fool Do you believe when you're all alone You held the key to your destiny gone Do you believe deep in your soul That too much loneliness makes you grow old Words can be empty, though filled with sound Stoned numb and drifting, hard to be profound Formed out of pleasure, chiseled by pain Never the highest and not the last one to gainIn my life the piano sings Brings me words that are not the strength of strings Fiery rain and rubies cooling in the sun Now I see that my world has only begun Notes that roll on winds with swirling wings Brings me words that are not the strength of strings When I'm feeling high or I'm feeling low Or there is no change Somehow days keep melting into the night And there's always light on the cosmic range I am always high, I am always low There is always change Hear the strings are bending in harmony Not so far from breaking on the cosmic range In my life the piano sings Brings me words that are not the strength of strings Fiery rain and rubies cooling in the sun Now I see that my world has only begun Notes that roll on winds with swirling wings Brings me words that are not the strength of stringsShe's the kind of girl Together like a lion The kind everybody wants to know She can fool you with her ways Leave you with nothing much to say And you try not to hang around But you really don't want To see her go away She's the kind of girl Mary golden time Sunshine and flowers in her hair Simple ways, she don't complain She likes to move, she won't explain And you wonder in the night If everything was right with you She might remain Doesn't everybody want to hear Doesn't everybody want to know What it is to be so near And watch it go She's the kind of girl Really has to see What it is that's on your mind She takes the time and understands She makes no judgments, no demands But she makes you feel the fool When you wonder how she slipped Right through your handsChanges come so quickly, easily it can seem bizarre They say there's a price you pay for going out too far You can buy a one way ticket out there all alone And you can sit and wonder why it's so hard to get back home Nothing is important lost, that's not easy to believe The longer you're in one place, the harder it is to leave You can have a thousand cards to pull out of your sleeve But in the end the loser is the one who does deceive There's always a reality in what you are doing Sometimes it's so hard to see which one is the true one I use to treat my friends like I was more than a millionaire Spending those big ones like I could afford them all upstairs But what's been flying high must always touch the ground Just walk upstairs and ask, you'll be likely directed down Into the reality of what you are doing Sometimes it's so hard to see which one is the true oneMy daddy was a handsome gambler He had a chain five miles long On every link a heart gets dangled Of another maid he loved and wronged He told to you some loving story He'd make you think he'd leave them true But love grows cold as love grows older And fades away like morning dew I'd rather be in some dark hollow Where the sun refused to shine Than to live here in Missouri With your memory always on my mind Come all ye fair and tender ladies Take warning how your court your man They're like a star on a summer's morning First they appear then they're gone again Your man They're like a star on a summer morning First they appear then they're gone again SO LO Come all ye fair and tender ladies take warning how your court your man They're like a star on a summer morning First they appear then they're gone againA refuse from a silver phial Put her faith into the moons and stars Said she had a mind that slept inside tomorrow And time could only heal its scars She was fire on the borderline The lion in the fall of roles Said she saw the sword of sorrow sunken In the sand of searching souls Sleeping in the master's room Seeing through his eyes for gain Keeping by his side not to be a victim Falling in the darkened rain She was taken from a cruel storm The refuse from a silver phial Took her magic master's words and sung And made his lower self worth whileThere's been some
