Your lipstick, his collar Don't bother, angel I know exactly what goes on When everything you'll get is everything that you've wanted, princess My finger on the trigger, or Me face down, dead across your floor Well, just so long as this thing's loaded And will you tell all your friends You've got your gun to my head This all was only wishful thinking This all was only wishful thinking And will you tell all your friends You've got your gun to my head This all was only wishful thinking This all was only wishful thinking Let's go Don't bother trying to explain, angel I know exactly what goes on when you're on, and How 'bout I'm outside of your window Watching him keep the details covered You're such a sucker for a sweet talker, yeahYou've got this new head filled up with smoke And I've got my veins all tangled close To those jukebox bars you frequent The safest place to hide A long night spent with your most obvious weakness, you start shaking at the thought You are everything I want'Cause you are everything I'm not And we lay, we lay together Just not too close, too close And we lay, we lay together Just not too close, too close I just wanna break you down so badly Well I trip over everything you say I just wanna break you down so badly In the worst way My inarticulate store-bought hangover hobby kit it talks And it says "You, oh, you are so cool"Scissor-shaped across the bed You are red, violent red You hollow out my hungry eyes You hollow out my hungry eyesShe said"Don't, don't let it go to your head Boys like you are a dime a dozen Boys like you are a dime a dozen"She said"You're a touch overrated You're a lush and I hate it But these grass stains on my knees They won't mean a thing"And all I need to know Is that I'm something you'll be missing Maybe I should hate you for this Never really did ever quite get that far Maybe I should hate you for this Never really did ever quite get that I'd never lie to you, unless I had to I'll do what I got to Unless I had to I'll do what I got to The truth is you could slit my throat And with my one last gasping breath I'd apologize for bleeding on your shirtWell, I can't regret Can't you just forget it I started something I couldn't finish And if we go down, we go down together Best friends means Well, best friends means And I've got a twenty-dollar bill That says you're up late night starting Fist fights vs  the fences in your backyard Wearing your black eye like a badge of honor Soaking in sympathy From friends who never loved you Nearly half as much as me Broken down in bars and bathrooms All I did was what I had to Don't believe me when I tell you"It's just what anyone would do"Take the time to talk about it Think a lot and live without it Don't believe me when I tell you"It's something unforgivable"Well, I can't regret Can't you just forget it I started something I couldn't finish Well, if we go down, we go down together Best friends means Well, best friends means Well, you never knew Well, I never told you Everything I know about breaking hearts I learned from you, it's true I've never done it with the style and grace you have But I made long-term plans Based on these mistakesWell, sad, small, sweet, so delicate It used to be this dying breed Well, I've got a bad feeling about this I've got a bad feeling about this You kept still until the long drive home And slept safe and close to the window Well, I've got a bad feeling about this I've got a bad feeling about Who's to say you'll have to go  Well, say you'll have to go To hell with you and all your friends To hell with you and all your friends, it's on Well, sad, small, sure and porcelain You're skin and bones, I'm a nervous wreck Well, I've got a bad feeling about this I've got a bad feeling about this You kept still until the long drive home You slept safe and close to the window Well, I've got a bad feeling about this I've got a bad feeling aboutGet up, get up Come on, come on, let's go There’s just a few things I think that you should know Those words at best were worse than teenage poetry Fragment ideas and too many pronouns Stop it, come on, you’re not making sense now You can't make them want you They're all just laughing Literate and stylish Kissable and quiet Well that's what girls' dreams are made of And that's all you need to know You have it or you don't You have it or you You have it in you You're sick of my time you're wastin'Girl, we're just separatin'Stop it, come on, you know I can’t help it I got the mic and you got the mosh pit What will it take to make you admit that you were wrong Was his demise so carefully constructed Well let's just say I got what I wanted'Cause in the end it’s always the same Let's goAll our secrets they are tailored trouble Draped loose now around your hips Your spotless instincts are valid We coexist Got 26 days to work with We've got 26 days to work with We'll see what all gets done I'm an addict for dramatics I confuse the two for love You can't tell me that you don't beg Liar If we're keeping score Then we're all choir boys at best Liar If we're keeping score Then we're all choir boys at best Got 26 days to work with Then back on that island that you swear by Still barely can afford It's still a question of "How long will this hold ""Well is it any different now that we are" "Oh, don't you go there, not here, not now""Not here, not now"So sick, so sick of being tired And oh so tired of being sick We're both such magnificent liars So "crush me baby, I'm all ears"So obviously desperate, so desperately obvious I'll give in one more time and feed you Stupid lines all about "It's basic"We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore Yeah, and uh, we won't stand for hazy eyes anymore We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore So sick, so sick of being tired And oh so tired of being sick Willing and ready to prove the worst of everything you said about So obviously desperate, so desperately obvious So good at setting bad examples Listen, trick, I've had all I can handle We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore We won't stand for hazy eyes anymoreSeptember never stays this cold Where I come from And you know I’m not one   for complaining But I love the way you’d roll Excuses off the tip of your tongue As I slowly fall apart Fall apart Is falling apart Is falling apart Is falling apart As of this won’t mean a thing come tomorrow And that’s exactly how I’ll make it seem Cause I'm still not sleeping Thinking I’ve crawled home from worse than this So please, please I’m running out of sympathy And I never said I’d take this I never said I'd take this lying down She says"come on, come on, let’s just get this over with”She says"come on, come on, let’s just get this over with”I never said I’d take this lying down, And I've crawled home from worse than this She says"come on, come on, let’s just get this over with”She says"come on, come on.."Two sides twist and then collide You're calling off the guards I'm coming through Adulteress conditioned to a spin cycled submission You know, sometimes it just feels better to give in And it's all too familiar And it happens all the time All the cards begin to stack up Twisting heartache into fine Little pieces that avoid an awful crime But it's you I can't deny Dull heat rises from the sheets I'm both a patient boy Well, and a jealous man My double standardized suspicion Is remedied, oh, my blue heaven Sometimes, it just feels better to give in
