Tired You stood in line at the grocery store A bottle of wine and nothing more An empty apartment to come home too It has been that way since 1972 The line on his face for every year she's missed A scar on his arm for every time he tried to follow her A tear in his eye, for every day gone by Going home to no one still you could hear him cry If I brought you down If I caused you to drown He's sad like winter leaves But she won't leave his mind tonight He stares upon her picture on the wall Then begins to cry Let it go He wakes to the sunrise A broken glass upon the floor The salt is dried upon his cheek We've seen this all beforeI remember the first time I saw you on heroin A hero in my eyes A hero in disguise I pretended not to care While all these eyes were on you But your eyes weren't you You've paid for this Black eyes Arms were skinny I did not recognize Your pale face White like bleach It's hard for me to preach When everyone's to blame But no one wants to be the same You've turned on yourself One more time There's no more time Trains will never travel Upon these tracks No going back The needle has skipped And you will be missedIs this what you want It's eight o'clock I'm nodding off Starlight is stealing my heart tonight Bar fight but I won't be there And I've tried all this before You swing and you miss and I miss the way things used to be Late night and you're driving me crazy Wait 'till you find this ain't the life you want to lead Regular Every night Regular But I won't fight you What if I don't care What if I don't care What if I don't care Wait 'till you find this ain't the life you want to lead Wait 'till you find Regular Every night Regular But I won't fight youI promise that I won't fall down I promise that I won't skin my knee Like you promised you'd always be around to take good care of me And I remember you standing behind that white picket fence with a white peaked face Trying hard to embrace my youth Before it escapes, before its too late And clutching the fence she said'How have I hurt you, What have I done ''Did I desert you, or spite with my tongue ''Was I too eager, or loved you too much 'I love you too much Now that I'm all grown  I'm feeling so alone Why have you brought me here Now that I'm all grown  I'm feeling so alone Why have you brought me here You say all these things I say but It's not the same I'm feeling so alone today but all I know I'll ice my thoughts I'll ice my mind for now It's not your fault, You did what you could do For this I will love you, for always You hold my heart and my tiny hand Thank you for all these thingsIt's come to this I swear this time my heart won't miss I've clinched these fists for far too long A broken house with gates made from broken promises But nobody's home So here I sit It's the light that wakes me But the time that breaks me down Like water drops Why won't this stop Dripping on my halo These angel wings of mine They haven't seen the light in weeks Let alone fly It's the light that wakes Me but the time that breaks me down Like water drops Why won't this stop It's got me down And who's gonna save me From falling to the ground You might as well finish me Grab with both hands And rip out these wings Now watch me fallI got to the car Drove far Decided to stay away With my foot on the gas Drove past All of the shit I needed to say I got to the car Drove far Decided to stay away With my foot on the gas Drove past All of the shit I needed to say I've waited 'till now for the right time I've waited 'till now for the right time to tell I've waited 'till now for the right time I've waited 'till now to open up to you And I can't breathe And I can't breathe And I can't breathe And i can't breathe Swimming with you is the hardest Everything you do is so true Swimming with you is the hardest thing And I won't hold my breath Swimming with you is the hardest Everything you do is so true Swimming with you is the hardest thing And I won't hold my breath And I won't hold my breath when I'm with youI follow you around Like I follow the sea But I see you're not Interested in me And I fall for your shadow It's all I've got And when you're walking away from me All I've got is lost And I forgot what I'd lost With this line that I'd crossed And now everything has changed back to nothing And I forgot what I'd lost With this line that I'd crossed And now everything has changed back to nothing And I forgot what I'd lost With this line that I'd crossed And now everything has changed back to nothing I see you by the pay phone As I'm walking home that night My emotions were unaffected And my eyes were disconnected The point is that I've created this crush To help me out To help me out of thisTen years and you're back again But I don't want to go back to this These kids were not my friends High school memories just like a kiss Forget how they laughed Forget how I cried Forget everything Forget how I lied to myself Just like a kiss And I can't forget how it was Just like a kiss And I can't forget my discomfort I'll never forget hiding behind this smile I never intended to let them see me while I was afraid Always hiding behind something That something's changing all the time It seems I'm crying about nothing Or maybe it's something I kept inside of myselfWe've waged this war since birth To cover up this earth with houses and roads Now everything must grow Expansion is our goal Now bolt these houses Down plant these children in the ground Now drive to work with blinders on Where everyone has got two jobs And four kids and three cars and one boat Everyone's chasing the same fucking thing Raise your head and brace yourself Now cry yourself to sleep Upon your king size bed with silk sheets Credit buys you everything Except love Except life Except this Everyone's chasing the same fucking thingMichael Is this where you run Is it my fault Am I the reason you're gone Michael Is this where you run Is it my fault Expect one thing from you and you fail Time flies when you're having fun But my clock stopped when my hand dropped from yours And you were gone Michael Is this where you run Is it my fault Am I the reason you're gone Michael Is this where you run Is it my fault Expect one thing from you Expect one thing from you Expect one thing from you The time you stole
