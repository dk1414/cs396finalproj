 we are young heartache to heartache we stand no promises no demands love is a battlefield We are strong No one can tell us we're wrong Searching our hearts for so long Both of us knowing Love is a battlefield You're begging me to go Then making me stay Why do you hurt me so bad It would help me to know Do I stand in your way Or am I the best thing you've had Believe me, believe me I can't tell you why But I'm trapped by your love And I'm chained to your sideWe belong, we belong to the light Many times, I tried to tell you Many times, I cried alone Always I'm surprised how well you Cut my feelings to the bone Don't wanna leave you really I've invested too much time To give you up that easy To the doubts that complicate your mind We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder We belong to the sound of the words, we've both fallen under Whatever we deny or embrace, for worse or for better We belong, we belong, we belong together Maybe it's a sign of weakness When I don't know what to say Maybe I just wouldn't know What to do with my strength anyway Have we become a habit Do we distort the facts Now, there's no looking forward Now, there's no turning back When you sayYour love is like a tidal wave Spinning over my head Drownin' me in your promises Better left unsaid You're the right kind of sinner To release my inner fantasy The invincible winner And you know that you were born to be You're a heartbreaker Dream maker, love taker Don't you mess around with me You're a heartbreaker Dream maker, love taker Don't you mess around, no, no, no Your love has set my soul on fire Burnin' out of control You taught me the ways of desire Now it's takin' its tollWell you're the real tough cookie with a long history Of breaking little hearts like the one in me That's okay, let's see how you do it Put up your dukes, let's get down to it Hit me with your best shot Why don't you hit me with your best shot Hit me with your best shot Fire away You come on with it, come on, you don't fight fair That's okay, see if I care Knock me down, it's all in vain I get right back on my feet again Hit me with your best shot Why don't you hit me with your best shot Hit me with your best shot Fire awayWe're running with the shadows of the night So baby, take my hand, it'll be all right Surrender all your dreams to me tonight They'll come true in the end You said, "Oh, girl, it's a cold world When you keep it all to yourself"I said, "You can't hide on the inside All the pain you've ever felt"Ransom my heart, but baby, don't look back'Cause we got nobody else"We're running with the shadows of the night So baby, take my hand, it'll be all right Surrender all your dreams to me tonight They'll come true in the end You know that sometimes, it feels like It's all moving way too fast Use every alibi and words you deny That love ain't meant to last You can cry tough baby, it's all right You can let me down easy, but not tonightThey cry in the dark, so you can't see their tears They hide in the light, so you can't see their fears Forgive and forget, all the while Love and pain become one and the same In the eyes of a wounded child Because hell Hell is for children And you know that their little lives can become such a mess Hell Hell is for children And you shouldn't have to pay for your love with your bones and your flesh Its all so confusing, this brutal abusing They blacken your eyes, and then 'pologize You're daddy's good girl, and don't tell mommy a thing Be a good little boy, and you'll get a new toy Tell grandma you fell off the swing Because hell Hell is for children And you know that their little lives can become such a mess Hell Hell is for children And you shouldn't have to pay for your love with your bones and your flesh No, hell is for childrenLivin' with my eyes closed Goin' day to day I never knew the difference I never cared either way Lookin' for a reason Searchin' for a sign Reachin' out with both hands I gotta feel the kick inside All fired up All fired up All fired up All fired up, fired up, fired up Hey!Ain't nobody livin'In a perfect world Everybody's out there Cryin' to be heard Now I got a new fire Burnin' in my eyes Lightin' up the darkness Movin' like a meteorite All fired up All fired up All fired up All fired up, fired up, fired up This bloody road remains a mystery This sudden darkness fills the air What are we waiting for Won't anybody help us What are we waiting for We can't afford to be innocent Stand up and face the enemy It's a do-or-die situation We will be invincible This shattered dream you cannot justify We're gonna scream until we're satisfied What are we running for We've got the right to be angry What are we running for When there's nowhere we can run to anymore We can't afford to be innocent Stand up and face the enemy It's a do or die situation We will be invincible And with the power of conviction There is no sacrifice It's a do-or-die situation We will be invincibleNever again, isn't that what you said You've been through this before You swore, this time, you'd think with your head No one would ever have you again And if takin' was gonna get done, you'd decide where and when Just when you think you got it down Your heart securely tied and bound They whisper promises in the dark Armed and ready, you fought love battles in the night But too many opponents made you weary of the fight Blinded by passion, you foolishly let someone in All the warnings went off in your head, still you had to give in Just when you think you got it down Resistance nowhere to be found They whisper promises in the dark But promises you know what they're for It sounds so convincing, but you heard it before'Cause talk is cheap and you gotta be sure And so you put up your guard And you try to be hard but your heart says try again You desperately search for a way to conquer the fear No line of attack has been planned to fight back the tears Where brave and restless dreams are both won and lost On the edge is where it seems it's well worth the costOoh, you're giving me the fever tonight I don't wanna give in, I'd be playing with fire You forget, I've seen you work before Take 'em straight to the top, leave 'em crying for more I've seen you burn 'em before Fire and ice You come on like a flame, then you turn a cold shoulder Fire and ice I wanna give you my love, but you'll just take a little piece of my heart You'll just tear it apart Moving in for the kill tonight You got every advantage when they put out the lights It's not so pretty when it fades away'Cause it's just an illusion in this passion play I've seen you burn 'em before Fire and ice You come on like a flame, then you turn a cold shoulder Fire and ice I wanna give you my love, but you'll just take a little piece of my heart So you think you got it all figured out You're an expert in the field, without a doubt But I know your methods inside and out And I won't be taken in by fire and ice
