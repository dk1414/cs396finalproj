Makin' my way downtown Walkin' fast, faces pass And I'm homebound Starin' blankly ahead Just makin' my way Makin' a way through the crowd And I need you And I miss you And now I wonder If I could fall into the sky Do you think time would pass me by 'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles If I could just see you Tonight It's always times like these when I think of you And I wonder if you ever think of me'Cause everything's so wrong, and I don't belong Livin' in your precious memoryCrashed on the floor when I moved in This little bungalow with some strange new friends Stay up too late, and I'm too thin We promise each other it's till the end Now we're spinning empty bottles It's the five of us With pretty eyed boys girls die to trust I can't resist the day No, I can't resist the day Jenny screams out and it's no pose'Cause when she dances, she goes and goes Beer through the nose on an inside joke I'm so excited, I haven't spoken And she's so pretty And she's so sure Maybe I'm more clever than a girl like her The summer's all in bloom The summer is ending soonJust a day, just an ordinary day Just trying to get by Just a boy, just an ordinary boy, but he was looking to the sky And as he asked if I would come along I started to realize That every day he finds just what he's looking for And like a shooting star, he shines And he said, "Take my hand Live while you can Don't you see your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand "And as he spoke, he spoke ordinary words Although they did not feel For I felt what I had not felt before And you'd swear those words could heal And as I looked up into those eyes His vision borrows mine And I know he's no stranger For I feel I've held him for all of time, and he said"Take my hand Live while you can Don't you see your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand "In the palm of your handI know you know We don't see We sow our truth Wait patiently I walk the streets with a song in my head Got my toes on my pup at the foot of my bed Now take the glitz back, I want the soul instead'Cause I found some kind of fairytale I used to hover Outside my truth Always worry Of what I'd lose Take away my record deal Spent the last two years getting to what's real I hope you feel just like I feel I found some kind of fairytaleYou light me up and then I fall for you You lay me down and then I call for you Stumbling on reasons that are far and few I'd let it all come down and then some for you Pretty baby, don't you leave me I have been saving smiles for you Pretty baby, why can't you see You're the one that I belong to I'll be the embrace that keeps you warm For you're the sun that breaks the storm I'll be alright and I'll sleep sound As long as you keep comin' 'round Oh, pretty baby And I know things can't last forever But there are lessons that you'll never learn Oh, just the scent of you, it makes me hurt So how's it you that makes me better Pretty baby, don't you leave me I have been saving smiles for you Pretty baby, why can't you see You're the one that I belong to I'll be the embrace that keeps you warm For you're the sun that breaks the storm I'll be alright and I'll sleep sound As long as you keep comin'Man, it's so nice to see you again Near that grey blue pool in L.A.,I close my book, move my bag, make some space'Cause it’s time to give that son a break So, tell me now, how these few years have been What is living to honor the past And I have been well, I say through a smile These feelings, they come and go fast Light your cigarette, I see the fame in your eyes Sing me that new song you sing The time for you and I, it was never quite right That matters, that means everything'Cause the garden walls grow quick Before you know, you’re outside of it The ivy's coming in It's so beautiful if you can find it Time, she’s always kept you on her good side Some people, they still fight their fate I understood clear what you said with your eyes We all speak in different waysStand up straight Do your trick Turn on the stars Jupiter shines so bright When you're around to tell us slow down We're too young you need to grow The speed's the key And they don't know who we are And who's to say that we're not good enough And who's to say that this is not our love Mother don't tell me friends are the ones that I lose Cause they'd bleed before you And sometimes family are the ones you'd choose It's too late now I hold on to this life I found And who's to say we won't burn it out And who's to say we won't sink in doubt Who's to say that we won't fade today Who are they anyway  Anyway they don't knowFor all you broken-hearted lovers lost Go, find another one'Cause you know time won't wait and you'll be late White rabbit's on the run It's hard to know what's good for you I know she let you down But the fever breaks when it's too much to take So you can put your weapons down And all you'll hear is the music And beauty stands before you And love comes back around again It's a carousel, my friend Never too late to change the pace Oh, how the days creep up on you But the goodness is something you don't have to chase'Cause it's following you...And all you'll hear is the music And beauty stands before you And love comes back around again It's a carousel, my friendFind a love Go build a cabin Find land and a tree Carve in a wish On your knees, planting seeds The dirt, making rows, where the devil don’t see My love, I agree, so lucky to find ya But memories, they don’t stay behind us Our minds are strong, could it be enough To bring strength to the bones Our weeping willow is hanging above me On my back in the sun, would it fall upon me I won’t let you down and man you will keep safe my love Safe my love Sow the earth A blanket of bounty In the distance a hearse The devil drives empty In a babies eyes The ritual purifies every designTwo, three I first saw you at the video exchange I know my heart and it will never change This temp work would be alright if you'd call me You'd call me I lay awake at night for you And I pray We'd cross the deepest oceans, cargo across the sea And if you don't believe me, just put your hands on me And all the constellations shine down for us to see And if you don't believe me, just put your hands on me The subway radiates with heat We barely met and still I cross the street To your door We'd cross the deepest oceans, cargo across the sea And if you don't believe me, just put your hands on me And all the constellations shine down for us to see And if you don't believe me, just put your hands on me
