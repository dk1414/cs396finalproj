Out on the third planet closest to the sun There's a special celebration And it sounds quite fun A jolly old fellow brings toys to everyone On a holiday they call Christmas Now I'm not gonna lie It makes no sense to me But here's what Earthlings told me About this Christmas mystery One, two, three four!Santa is a furry freak With epic superpowers He flies to every human home In under fourteen hours He's a master burglar A pro at pickin' locks If you don't leave milk and cookies out He will put dung in your socks If you act nicely through the night And don't jump on your bed Santa comes with sugar plums And hurls them at your head But if you're on his naughty list He shoots missiles at your toes He might just roast your chestnuts With his powerful flamethrowerI’m not afraid, I’m good with God I got my sins, in fact I got a lot I got a soul that’s good and flawed I’m good with God, I’m good with God I’m not afraid, got no regrets I paid my dues, I paid my debts I made a mess but it’s my bed No regrets, no regrets Goodness knows I’ve done you wrong I’m not too gone to see All’s I knows I’m good with God I wonder how she feels about me I wonder how she feels about me You should be scared, I’m not so nice Many a man has paid the price You’re pretty thick, so I’ll tell you twice I’m not so nice, I’m not so nice I made you up and I’ll break you down I’ll do it slow how does that sound You’re just a joke that’s going roundWhen we are born, we are swaddled and snuggled Whispered to, fussed over, tickled and cuddled When we grow up, things get muddled And here it is, Christmas time Will you stop by for a piece of delicious Peach pie while I tell you my yuletide wishes You can help me do the dishes'Cause here it is, Christmas time We all want someone who will love us and hold us To curl up alongside when nights are the coldest We all want someone who will hug us and kiss us All I want is you for Christmas Let us examine the holiday spirit Let the small kids sing so we can all hear it Light up a fire and pull the chair near it'Cause here it is, Christmas time We all want someone who will love us and hold us To curl up alongside when nights are the coldest We all want someone who will hug us and kiss us All I want is you for ChristmasBig brown eyes and a gust of wind And the cherry burns the corner of the page that says"The end is coming soon", not soon enough Restring all your guitars, pack up all your stuff'Cause if Robert's dad is right We might not make it through the night And I'd hate to go alone Oh  Please pick up the phone Well, a box of red and a pill or three And I'm calling time and temperature just for some company I wish you were here, I wish I was too I'll drink myself to sleeplessness, I always do You don't want me anymore Since fame and fortune broke down our door You don't give me no respect What did I expect And If that phone don't ring one more time Well, I'm gonna lose what's left of my mind You made a big impression for a girl of your size Now I can't get by without you and your big brown eyes And your big brown eyes And your big brown eyesWhen we are born we are swaddled and suckled Whispered to, fussed over, tickled and cuddled When we grow up things get muddled And here it is, Christmas time Will you stop by for a piece of delicious Peach pie while I tell you my yuletide wishes You can help me do the dishes'Cause here it is, Christmas time We all want someone who will love us and hold us To curl up alongside when nights are the coldest We all want someone who will hug us and kiss us All I want is you for Christmas Let us examine the holiday spirit Let the small kids sing so we can all hear it Light up a fire and pull the chair near it'Cause here it is, Christmas time We all want someone who will love us and hold us To curl up alongside when nights are the coldest We all want someone who will hug us and kiss us All I want is you for ChristmasJesus loves you more than I do Just because He doesn't know you Not like I do Jesus says you'll get salvation If you just keep on waitin'And readin' the same book Over and over again Well, you can talk to Him all night But I'm right here He makes wine from water But I just bought you a beer You say Jesus loves you And I say what about me Maybe Jesus loves you But where the hell is he He's got the power and the glory He's got a pretty kick-ass story And what do I got I got the hots for youEvery night is Friday night Without you Every night is Friday night Without you When I was young I was dumb as a rock I could not read a clock And nothin' didn't mean nothin' to me Now I'm no saint But I ain't such a freak On the days of the week I work hard, hard Every night is Friday night Without you Every night is Friday night Without you Kids, clap your hands If you can be real Got to say what you feel If you feel anything, anything, anything, anythingYour eyes are the color of the earth as seen from outer space You got a gorgeous face Though it's a little odd Tell me that you like the songs that tell the story of Real love The kind that's flawed Let's drink whiskey and do it all night long Let's get drunk and get it on Take you to a cheap hotel out on the interstate Well, you look so great To me This is the perfect place for a rendezvous It's got a rotten view But the ice is free Let's drink whiskey and do it all night long Let's get drunk and get it on Lay down a blanket beneath the water tower Watch the meteor shower And heaven on display We got right here, right now, lucky us It's wanderlust What a perfect dayWell, I must have been stoned when this whole thing started'Cause I just can't seem to think straight anymore Can't figure out where I'm at Maybe Memphis, maybe Mexico I think you're swell, but I ain't gonna tell you so I think you're great, but it's late and I'd better go Hitchhike to Rhome Take a Greyhound to Fredericksburg Well I'm flat-out broke, I've been smoking butts for days You say, "Maybe you can stay with me"I say, "Lady, that's a dangerous plan"You're quite a woman, but I don't wanna be your man You're quite a kisser, but listen close and understand Take a letter to God"Dear Sir, I'm dissatisfied Well it ain't Your fault they keep pouring salt on my heart"All's I need is a brief reprieve I keep leaving, I ain't gettin' nowhere Won't you linger, let me run my fingers through your hair Won't you stay  I can play like I don't care I think you're dope, and I hope I'm making myself clear I think you're fly, and that's why I'm getting out of hereThis is the story of Victoria Lee She started off on Percodan and ended up with me She lived in Berkeley 'til the earthquake shook her loose She lives in Texas now where nothin' ever moves Victoria you talk so low that no one else can hear Unless you point your megaphone directly at their ear This is the story of Victoria Lee She started on Rohypinol and ended up with me You'd like to think they're your friends, but they're not your friends And in the end a friend's the one you'll never know, oh don't you know You'd like to think you're groovy, it's your movie, you see through me, but it's true And in the end you'll know, Victoria don't go  Victoria, Victoria don't go This is the story of Victoria's heart You might think it's stupid, but I still think it's art She lost her lover to an accident at sea She pushed him overboard and ended up with me Victoria, you dance so fast that no one else can see Victoria I hope you use just one more dance for me This is the story of Victoria's heart It's a really big one, and I don't know where to start
