Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence One step from lashing out at you You want in to get under my skin and call yourself a friend I've got more friends like you, what do I do Is there no standard anymore What it takes, who I am, where I've been, belong You can't be something you're not Be yourself by yourself, stay away from me A lesson learned in life Known from the dawn of time Respect, walk What did you say Respect, walk Are you talking to me  Are you talking to me Run your mouth when I'm not around, it's easy to achieve You cry to weak friends that sympathize Can you hear the violins playing your song Those same friends tell me your every wordReverend, reverend Is this some conspiracy Crucified for no sins No revenge beneath me Lost within my plans for life It all seems so unreal I'm a man cut in half in this world Left in my misery The reverend he turned to me Without a tear in his eyes Nothing new for him to see I didn't ask him why I will remember The love our souls had sworn to make Now I watch the falling rain All my mind can see now is your Well I guess you took my youth and gave it all away Like the birth of a new-found joy This love would end in rage And when she died, I couldn't cry The pride within my soul You left me incomplete All alone as the memories now unfold" ft  Cruz Cafuné, Abhir Hathi, Bejo, E L I MA]This is the motherfucking remix BD P Music, mami Este es el remix, baby Pow, pow Si no se acuerda no pasó, ese es su lema Trajo una botella para ahogar las pena'Su amiguita pa' to's la'os la acompaña Hace tiempo que por hombres no se raya Si no se acuerda no pasó, pero esta vez se arrebató Se puso pa' la vuelta cuando la noche cayó Baby, ahora no digas que no que tú ya sabes quiénes somos, seh Y este remix es pa' que el booty te bote solo, mai Ya cayó la noche Las gatas se bajaron del coche, ahora toca pecar Hace que no me conoce Y me la imagino en mil poses al verla bailar Por eso cuando lo hacemos ella se viene y rápido se va Quiere estar conmigo y a la misma vez no estar amarrá' Oh, come on Under the lights where we stand tall Nobody touches us at all Showdown, shootout Spread fear within, without I say we're gonna take what's ours to have Spread the word throughout the land They say the bad guys wear black We're tagged and can't turn back You see us coming and you all together run for cover We're taking over this town Here we come, reach for your gun And you better listen well, my friend You see, it's been slow down below Aimed at you, we're the Cowboys from Hell Deed is done, again we've won Ain't talking no tall tales, friend'Cause high noon, your doom Coming for you, we're the Cowboys from HellAgony is the price that you'll pay in the end Domination consumes you, then calls you a friend It's a twisted fall Binds are like steel and manipulates the will to be And it's hard to see How soon we forget when there's nothing else left to destroy It's a useless ploy Your eyes will see the dawn of the day And the writing on the wall Those words that stare into your soul And to yourself you will befall It's domination pushed into living hell Domination Yeah A now blacked heart is reaching out in divinity Bodies suspended by chains over razors and nails It's a penalty Each razor a vice and each nail marks demise of your life Grim construction grows Has life played a trick Sealed you in brick by brick till your end Forcing you to bendIf ever words were spoken painful and untrue I said I loved but I lied In my life, all I wanted Was the keeping of someone like you As it turns out, deeper within me Love was twisted and pointed at you Never ending pain, quickly ending life You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break You keep this love, love, love You keep this love, love, love You keep this love I'd been the tempting one stole her from herself This gift in pain, her pain was life And sometimes I feel so sorry I regret this the hurting of you But you make me so unhappy I'd take my life and leave love with you I'd kill myself for you, I'd kill you for myself You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break You keep this love, love, love You keep this love, love, love You keep this loveA dead issue Don't wrestle with it Deaf ears are sleeping A guilty bliss So inviting Nailed to the cross Wash away us all Take us with the flood Then throughout the night they were raped and executed Cold hearted world Your language unheard of The vast sound of tuning out The rash of negativity Is seen one-sidedly Burn away the day Wash away us all Take us with the floodI see you had your mind all made up You group of pitiful liars Before I woke to face the day Your master plan transpired Something told me This job has more to meet the eye My song is not believed My words somewhat deceiving Now I'm unwhole You've waged a war of nerves But you can't crush the kingdom Can't be what your idols are Can't leave the scar You cry for compensation I ask you please just give us Five minutes alone Just give us FIve minutes alone I read your eyes, your mind was made up You took me for a fool You used complexion of my skin For a counter racist tool You can't burn me I've spilled my guts out in the past Taken advantage of'Cause you know where I come from My pastRevenge, I'm screaming revenge again Wrong, I've been wrong for far too long Been constantly so frustrated, I've moved mountains with less When I channel my hate to productive, I don't find it hard to impress Bones in traction Hands break to hone raw energy Bold and disastrous My ears can't hear what you say to me Hold your mouth for the war Use it for what it's for Speak the truth about me Determined Possessed, I feel a conquering will down inside me Strength, the strength of many to crush who might stop me My strength is in number and my soul lies in every one The releasing of anger can better any medicine under the sun Bones in traction Hands break to hone raw energy Bold and disastrous My ears can't hear what you say to meCan't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence One step from lashing out at you You want in to get under my skin and call yourself a friend I've got more friends like you, what do I do Is there no standard anymore What it takes, who I am, where I've been, belong You can't be something you're not Be yourself by yourself, stay away from me A lesson learned in life Known from the dawn of time Respect, walk What did you say Respect, walk Are you talking to me  Are you talking to me Run your mouth when I'm not around, it's easy to achieve You cry to weak friends that sympathize Can you hear the violins playing your song Those same friends tell me your every word
