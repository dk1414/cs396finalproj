Time always wins me Over when I am tired I will not allow this to Be me, all that it can be You can't kill me, oh If I could buy anything I would buy all the times That got hard and got tough Not enough to break me All I want is to reach out for All of you, all of you It's the simple things that make me And take me, all the way All I need to get by Is the death of me, all that cannot Anything through you I can do what I wantedIt's a shame when you know when you know this When you roll your eyes back in your head Fall asleep again and you're wakened By the sounds of your heart when it's broken Beautiful the scene every time When I look at your face in the night It's so bad, the things in my mind But I swear I'll never leave you here Cause we deserve a second chance I promise I'm not looking back I'll love you till the end of this I'll take away your fear I can't believe we're doing this And all the secrets that we've kept have kept us from the best of this The best of you and me You bottle it up inside And take all the things I deny And throw it away on the left And take it back on the right Beautiful the scene every time When I look at your face in the night It's so bad, the things in my mindI'd do this for you All for you But this is for me All for me And we are just faking all along'Cause everyone's got their secret song Oh you can stay here forever I won't You can sit and regret everything But I don't Cause I walk alone Always alone YE AAfter I figure this out I'm not coming down No You say you're happy with your daytime jobs Oh please Well guess what Your lowest point is the high for me YE AYou small town idiots won't keep me from my dreams I'll see to it, you'll see this side of me OH Y EAAs you take off your bandage Ask yourself if you're alright now Take a break from the world And all the ones you love Let it out as you yell it Might as well 'cause you're all alone Name in vain while you're at it Feels so good I've said a lot of things I've done it all but not this I've gotta figure out Why the world is so big While you hide in the forest You engage with the animals Gathering all around you It's what you wanted all along To the secrets and knowledge And opinions from all around When the sky turns to water You'll know what to doBody on the shoulder Heavy is upon us Isn't what you wanted Tell me when it's over Over this I hate it But hate is overrated Rate what you can make it Can you even take it all away Disappear, disappearing You're disappear disappearing You got to run away You got to escape You're nowhere now, oh You do anything for love'Cause love is what you're made of You'll make it out oh somehow Just keep your eyes on me now Your worry will be over Over soon just know that That I will overcome this For you I'll take it all awayHave you notice What you started Does it matter who you are And these necessary movements They just make you fall apart And you try so hard It's a game you play When you're always second best I've made the same mistakes But all this is a message For the different ones So take this for yourself this time You've been watching With your sore eyes But all you know is lies And it kills you every time You complain about your life And your wasting time And your standing still It's a game you play When you're always second best I've made the same mistakes But all this is a message For the different ones So take this for yourself this time Again you'll find That hope is standing on your sideI could hear the water flow And I'm falling in I could see what you bring False hope and fear And I'm sideways and strained As I lay awake under the moonlight Will I have enough to make the sun rise I get a little weird, I get scared sometimes I give it up to you, I need a new life Is it a privacy fake An unlikely revenge I can't wait till you go And never come back again And I'm sideways This strain, so strange As I lay awake under the moonlight Will I have enough to make the sun rise I get a little weird, I get scared sometimes I give it up to you, I need a new lifeJust a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world She took the midnight train goin' anywhere Just a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit He took the midnight train goin' anywhere A singer in a smoky room The smell of wine and cheap perfume For a smile you can share the night It goes on and on and on and on Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard Their shadows searching in the night Streetlight people living just to find emotion Hiding somewhere in the night Working hard to get my fill'Cause everybody wants a thrill Payin' anything to roll the dice Just one more time Well, some will win, some will lose And some were born to sing the blues Oh, the movie never ends It goes on and on and on and on Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard Their shadows searching in the night Streetlight people living just to find emotion Hiding somewhere in the nightYou've got a beautiful temper But it gets the best of you, best of you But you know your mouth is on the edge of a secret And you make adjustments for cover But you want to see it through, see it through And though you're standing all alone now, it's your fault Your heart is beating faster And this isn't what you want Wake me up You know I can't stand this I guess I'll try to find a way To try to forget it Get over this Before you You say thanks for the notion And even know that this is true, this is true It's funny how I always hear you say that you're okay I guess you're keeping it level I haven't heard from you, heard from you You're probably living in the past But it won't last It won't lastYesterday I was higher right under my smile The longest day of my entire life I was going backwards, and if I had known it I would have my stopped my white lies And that was all my, all my fault But that's what makes the pieces of a normal man I knew this all but I didn't know enough To know it comes from this I'm doing my eyes right I'm sleeping all through the night But all of my thoughts are white All of this can't be real, real tonight, real tonight And it's all my fault But that's what makes the pieces of a normal man I knew this all but I didn't know enough To know it comes from this All my fault But that's what makes the pieces of a normal man I'm doing my eyes right
