I see right through to you See right through to you See right through to you I see right through to you It's not like I don't feel your mood What you have for me is different Than the rest that moves I'll be positive I know that I could be there too'Cause you have it all, have it all I see right through to you See your every move See right through to you See your every move I know you now I reach your mind You've shown somehow What I could find On the inside There you will see We're all alike You and meI'm in a place where I can't breathe Something is wrong cause I can't see Why you'd expect me to give into you I'm like a land without a name Something's can never be the same Why would you want me to give into you Don't let me walk away Don't wait for rain Show me another day Turn me around and ease my pain Don't let me walk away Don't wait for rain Show me another day Turn me around and ease my pain Don't'Don't'Did you forget the way it was There used to be a time for us Did you expect me to give into you Why would you let me turn away Why can't you see that I won't stay When you expect me to give in to youYou can't keep me holding on I've given you some time I can't make you come along If you don't share your mind Every time you close your eyes I know you feel the same Everything you try to fight Is drowning in the rain What does it take to open your eyes Don't let it fade You've got to let the sun shine through the rain Open your eyes, don't let me wait You've got to let the sun shine through the rain Tell me why you turn away whenever I believe Finally you've come to say I'm everything you need Every time you close your eyes I know you feel the same Everything you try to fight Is drowning in the rain What does it take to open your eyes Don't let it fade You've got to let the sun shine through the rain Open your eyes, don't let me wait You've got to let the sun shine through the rainSo many people looking for happiness Expecting more of a brighter day You'd sell your soul running from loneliness Instead of giving yourself away When you're walking in the sky Heaven is holding hands with you So you better learn to fly Before you're falling through'Cause I'm walking in the sky Heaven is holding hands with me Now I think I've learned to fly I'm happy just to be You guide me here asking the question why I used to close every open door I'd find the sun even on cloudy skies I've had my time and I don't need more When you're walking in the sky Heaven is holding hands with you So you better learn to fly Before you're falling through'Cause I'm walking in the sky Heaven is holding hands with me Now I think I've learned to fly I'm happy just to beI wanna feel your touch You know it's easier if we get closer I'm not asking for too much I just get this feeling over and over Cuz it's just you that I see Nothing but you I feel so free I just get this feeling over and over You make me feel high on life When I'm with you I can fly I wouldn't stop this feeling I wouldn't stop this feeling It makes me feel high on life Intensifies what's inside I wouldn't stop this feeling from taking over If you could only say Why it feels so good When you move closer I think we're on our way I just get this feeling over and over Cuz it's just you that I see Nothing but you, I feel so free I just get this feeling over and overYou can get me right there, where I want to be Feeling it all over, deep inside of me Every time I think i'm close you take me closer Even now when you're away I feel you near You've got a way of making sun shine out the rain You've got a way of turning ashes into flames I can't believe you're making darkness into light You're making all my contradictions turn out right You're in my horizon, everywhere I see And when I try to reach you you're right next to me Every time I think i'm close you take me closer Even now when you're away I feel you're near You've got a way of making sun shine out the rain You've got a way of turning ashes into flames I can't believe you're making darkness into light Like you make all the famous cliches sound so right Every time I think i'm close you take me closer Even now when you're away I feel you're near You've got a way of making sun shine out the rain You've got a way of turning ashes into flames I can't believe you're making darkness into light You're making all my contradictions turn out rightTalk to me I can only hear you breathe Don't hold back Set my mind at ease Tell me don't wait till the morning breaks I need to know I need to know When i'm here

turn away and leave me alone Speak to me I have to understand What's going on Do you feel the same Tell me don't wait till the morning breaks I need to know I need to know When i'm here for you won't
