chains No, I don't give a damn whet the people say There's no use holding back desire We've burnt our fingers now lets jump into the flames Never mind the stars in the sky Never mind the when and the why Got a feeling higher than high This is the real thing Never mind the rain and the storm We'll keep each other warm We got something stronger than strong This is the real thing Gonna walk out hand in hand So let them criticise 'cos they don't understand We've got nothing to hide It's just loveHe's home again from another day She smiles at him as he walks through the door She wonders if it will be okay It's hard for her when he doesn't respond He says: babe, you look a mess You look dowdy in that dress It's just not like it used to be Then she says...I may not be a lady, but I'm all woman From Monday to Sunday, I work harder than you know I'm no classy lady, but I'm all woman And this woman needs a little love to make her strong You're not the only one She stands there and lets the tears flow Tears that she's been holding back so long She wonders where did all the loving go The love they used to share when they were strong She says: yes, I look a mess But I don't love you any less I thought you always thought enough of me To always be impressedSomeday I'm coming back, and it won't be long Before you call me and tell me to come home Someday I'm coming back, and it won't be long Before I'm home, home and in your arms What did I do, my darling, that made you send me running Told you to cast me down and throw me out What can I tell you, honey, If I don't know what I've done All I can hope is that you ask me to come back home Someday I'm coming back, and it won't be long Before you call me and tell me to come home Someday I'm coming back, and it won't take long Before I'm home, home and in your arms Even in stormy weather, we always stuck together You always kept me near, were so sincere So why so sudden the change of heart Why do I feel like I've done wrong When all that I want is that you ask me to come back home Someday I'm coming back, and it won't be long Before you call me and tell me to come home Someday I'm coming back, and it won't be long Before I'm home, home and in your armsIf I could change the way I live my life today I wouldn't change a single thing'Cause if I change my world into another place I wouldn't see your smiling face Honey,
