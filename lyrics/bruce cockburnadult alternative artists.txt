Don't the hours grow shorter as the days go by You never get to stop and open your eyes One day you're waiting for the sky to fall The next you're dazzled by the beauty of it all When you're lovers in a dangerous time Lovers in a dangerous time These fragile bodies of touch and taste This vibrant skin—this hair like lace Spirits open to the thrust of grace Never a breath you can afford to waste When you're lovers in a dangerous time Lovers in a dangerous time When you're lovers in a dangerous time Lovers in a dangerous time When you're lovers in a dangerous time Sometimes you're made to feel as if your love's a crime—But nothing worth having comes without some kind of fight—Got to kick at the darkness 'til it bleeds daylightHere comes the helicopter—second time today Everybody scatters and hopes it goes away How many kids they've murdered only God can say, hey If I had a rocket launcher If I had a rocket launcher If I had a rocket launcher I'd make somebody pay I don't believe in guarded borders and I don't believe in hate I don't believe in generals or their stinking torture states And when I talk with the survivors of things too sickening to relate If I had a rocket launcher If I had a rocket launcher If I had a rocket launcher I would retaliate On the Rio Lacantún one hundred thousand wait To fall down from starvation—or some less humane fate Cry for Guatemala with a corpse in every gateSun's up, mmm hmm, looks okay The world survives into another day And I'm thinking about eternity Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me I had another dream about lions at the door They weren't half as frightening as they were before But I'm thinking 'bout eternity Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me Walls windows trees, waves coming through You be in me and I'll be in you Together in eternity Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me Up among the firs where it smells so sweet Or down in the valley where the river used to be I got my mind on eternity Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me And I'm wondering where the lions are I'm wondering where the lions are I'm wondering where the lions are, uh huh I'm wondering where the lions are I'm wondering where the lions are Mmm, wondering where the lions are Uh huh Uh huhRain forest Mist and mystery Teeming green Green brain facing lobotomy Climate control centre for the world Ancient cord of coexistence Hacked by parasitic greedhead scam—From Sarawak to Amazonas Costa Rica to mangy B.C  hills—Cortege rhythm of falling timber What kind of currency grows in these new deserts These brand new flood plains If a tree falls in the forest does anybody hear If a tree falls in the forest does anybody hear Anybody hear the forest fall Cut and move on Cut and move on Take out trees Take out wildlife at a rate of species every single day Take out people who've lived with this For a hundred thousand years—Inject a billion burgers worth of beef—Grain eaters—methane dispensers Through thinning ozone Waves fall on wrinkled earth—Gravity, light, ancient refuse of stars Speak of a drowning—But this, this is something other Busy monster eats dark holes in the spirit world Where wild things have to go To disappear ForeverMary had a baby Mary had a baby Mary had a baby The people keep coming but the train has gone Where did she lay him  Where did she lay him  Where did she lay him  The people keep coming but the train has gone Laid him in a manger Laid him in a manger Laid him in a manger The people keep coming but the train has gone What did she name him  What did she name him  What did she name him  The people keep coming but the train has gone Named him King Jesus Named him King Jesus Named him King Jesus The people keep coming but the train has goneSunset is an angel weeping Holding out a bloody sword No matter how I squint I cannot Make out what it's pointing toward Sometimes you feel like you've lived too long Days drip slowly on the page You catch yourself Pacing the cage I've proven who I am so many times The magnetic strip's worn thin And each time I was someone else And everyone was taken in Powers chatter in high places Stir up eddies in the dust of rage Set me to pacing the cage I never knew what you all wanted So I gave you everything All that I could pillage All the spells that I could sing It's as if the thing were written In the constitution of the age Sooner or later You'll wind up pacing the cagePadded with power here they come International loan sharks backed by the guns Of market hungry military profiteers Whose word is a swamp and whose brow is smeared With the blood of the poor Who rob life of its quality Who render rage a necessity By turning countries into labour camps Modern slavers in drag as champions of freedom Sinister cynical instrument Who makes the gun into a sacrament—The only response to the deification Of tyranny by so-called "developed" nations'Idolatry of ideology North south east west Kill the best and buy the rest It's just spend a buck to make a buck You don't really give a flying fuck About the people in miseryAll the diamonds in this world That mean anything to me Are conjured up by wind and sunlight Sparkling on the sea I ran aground in a harbour town Lost the taste for being free Thank God He sent some gull-chased ship To carry me to sea Two thousand years and half a world away Dying trees still grow greener when you pray Silver scales flash bright and fade In reeds along the shore Like a pearl in a sea of liquid jade His ship comes shining Like a crystal swan in a sky of suns His ship comes shiningLook at them working in the hot sun The pilloried saints and the fallen ones Working and waiting for the night to come And waiting for a And waiting for a And waiting for a miracle Somewhere out there is a place that's cool Where peace and balance are the rule Working toward a future like some kind of mystic jewel And waiting for a And waiting for a And waiting for a miracle You rub your palm On the grimy pane In the hope that you can see You stand up proud You pretend you're strong In the hope that you can be Like the ones who've cried Like the ones who've died Trying to set the angel in us freeForty years in the wilderness getting to know the beasts Projected and reflected on the greatest and the least Forty years of days and nights—angels hovering near Kept me moving forward though the way was far from clear And they said Take up your load Run south to the road Turn to the setting sun Sun going down Got to cover some ground Before everything comes undone Take up your load Run south to the road Turn to the setting sun Sun going down Got to cover some ground Before everything comes undone Comes undone Forty years in the wilderness dancing with the flies Dazzled by the visions rolling out before my eyes Angel-made graffiti, demons in disguise You could trade away your birthright for another day's supplies Or you could
