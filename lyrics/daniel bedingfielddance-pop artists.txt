If you're not the one, then why does my soul feel glad today If you're not the one, then why does my hand fit yours this way If you are not mine, then why does your heart return my call If you are not mine, would I have the strength to stand at all I never know what the future brings But I know you're here with me now We'll make it through And I hope you are the one I share my life with I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am Is there any way that I could stay in your arms If I don't need you, then why am I cryin' on my bed If I don't need you, then why does your name resound in my head If you're not for me, then why does this distance maim my life If you're not for me, then why do I dream of you as my wife I don't know why you're so far away But I know that this much is true We'll make it through And I hope you are the one I share my life with And I wish that you could be the one I die with And I'm praying you're the one I build my home with I hope I love you all my lifeIf only I can get through this I just gotta get through this I just gotta get through this I gotta get through this I gotta get through this I gotta make it, gonna make, gonna make it through Said I'm gonna get through this I'm gonna get through this I gotta take, gotta take my mind off of you Give me just a second then I'll be alright Surely one more moment couldn't break my heart Give me 'til tomorrow then I'll be okay Just another day and then I'll hold you tight When your love is pouring like the rain I close my eyes and it's gone again When will I get the chance to say I love you I pretend that you're already mine Then my heart ain't breaking every time I look into your eyesI feel like a song without the words A man without a soul A bird without its wings A heart without a home I feel like a knight without a sword The sky without the sun'Cause you are the one I feel like a ship beneath the waves A child that lost its way A door without a key A face without a name I feel like a breath without the air And every day's the same Since you've gone away I gotta have a reason to wake up in the morning You used to be the one that put a smile on my face There are no words that could describe how I miss you And I miss you every day Yeah And I'm never gonna leave your side And I'm never gonna leave your side again Still holdin' on, girl I won't let you go'Cause when I'm lyin' in your arms I know I'm homeHe don't love you like I love you Don't think about you like I think about you He don't wanna have your children He don't wanna build his life around you Tell me I should not be feeling what I am today Tell me to silence my heart Tell me we've been here before And I will walk away from your love For there is a wall between you and I And he hasn't been treating you right I've been watching it all I've seen you cry And I just gotta tell you tonight That he don't love you like I love you Don't think about you like I think about you He don't wanna have your children He don't wanna build his life around you Tell me this love's just a feeling and Will pass away Tell me your heart is a liar Tell me you're not what I know you are All that a man could desireI gotta get through this I gotta get through this I gotta make it, gonna make, gonna make it through Said I'm gonna get through this I'm gonna get through this I gotta take, gotta take my mind off of you Give me just a second then I'll be all right Surely one more moment couldn't break my heart Give me 'til tomorrow then I'll be okay Just another day and then I'll hold you tight If only I can get through this If only I can get through this If only I can get through this God, God, gotta help me get through this I gotta get through this I gotta get through this I gotta make it, gonna make, gonna make it through Said I'm gonna get through this I'm gonna get through this I gotta take, gotta take my mind off of youWhen your love is pouring like the rain I close my eyes and it's gone again When will I get the chance to say I love you I pretend that you're already mine Then my heart ain't breaking every time I look into your eyes If only I can get through this If only I can get through this If only I can get through this God, God, gotta help me get through this I gotta get through this I gotta get through this I gotta make it, gonna make, gonna make it through Said I'm gonna get through this I'm gonna get through this I gotta take, gotta take my mind off of you Give me just a second then I'll be alright Surely one more moment couldn't break my heart Give me 'til tomorrow then I'll be okay Just another day and then I'll hold you tightI could be James Dean of the music scene I could be a big star like that man called Queen I could have fly moves, be a dance floor dream But if she can't seem to notice me Then what's it worth now Could have my teeth flashing a Brad Pitt smile Be wearing Versace 'cause that's my style Could have my hair cut by the extra mile But if she can't make it worth my while Then what's the point now I wanna know if youâ€™re busy I wanna know if you're doing anything tonight I wanna know if you missed me I wanna know, baby I wanna know I wish that I could kiss your lips The way that I, I want to, baby I wish that I could be your man I wish that you could be my lady I could be sly stone of the family crew I could be big bad Daddy Warbucks And love you too I could be knocked senseless by what you do But if it's pain that you put me through It isn't love now I made up my own darn mind I'm getting no love after all this time I'm gonna make music till my brain is fried Because you can't see the man inside It ain't enough nowCan you see The honest questions in my heart this hour I'm opening like a flower to the rain And do you know the silent sorrows of a Never ending journey through the pain Do you see a brighter day for me Another day  A day Do you wonder what's in store for me The cure for me  The way Oh, look down and see the tears I've cried The lives I've lived The deaths I've died But you died them too And all for me And you say:"I will pour my water down Upon a thirsty barren land And streams will flow from the dust of Your bruised and broken soul You will grow like the grass Upon the the fertile plains of Asia By the streams of living water You will grow You will grow"I'm never shy but this is different I can't explain the way I'm feeling tonight I'm losing control of my heart Tell me what can I do to make you happy Nothing I ever say seems to come out right I'm losing control of my heart And I wish that I could be Another better part of me Can't hear what you're thinkin'Maybe if I just let go You'll open up your heart But I can't read you I wish I knew what's going through your mind Can't touch you, your heart's defended I get left behind I can't reach you I wish I knew what's going through your mind Can't touch you, your heart's protected, I get left behind No no no no no No no no no no I like you so much I'm acting stupid I can't play the game, I'm all intense and alive I'm losing control of my heart I'm not supposed to be this nervous I should play my hand all cool and calm I can't breathe I'm losing control of my heart Heart, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahHey remember me Hard to forget, right Insistent, demanding When we were both sixteen I remember you in the spotlight You seemed so in control Hiding behind your wall Have you ever met somebody who could Unmask you The way you unmask me Guidelines and sub-routines You make me forget the things That I put in place to save my face But I'm not sure if it's a face worth saving Show me the real you And I'll show you the real me Can we make a second first impression baby Show me the real you And I'll show you the real me Can we make a second first impression, baby Maybe, maybe, yeah Seven years have past Now here I come I caught the briefest glimpse I haven't seen it since When you smile at me Where'd you smile from From insecurity But you're secure with me Have you never let somebody in to Unmask you The way you unmask me I know it's dangerous Please don't be afraid because This is your life I used to live Now I know It's not a life worth living
