we're young'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run Wendy, let me in, I wanna be your friend I wanna guard your dreams and visions Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet hips And strap your hands 'cross my engines Together we could break this trap We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire 'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider But I gotta know how it feels I wanna know your love is wild Girl, I wanna know that love is realLife goes on day after day Hearts torn in every way So ferry 'cross the Mersey'cause this land's the place I love And here I'll stay And here I'll stay People they rush everywhere Each with their own secret care So ferry 'cross the Mersey'cause this land's the place I love And here I'll stay And here I'll

right Rage hard, against the dark Rage hard Rage Rage hard Though blue eyes of children They shine without fear Hope is the future, with oceans of cheer There's nothing to fear Though laughter of angels Resounding from Heaven Keep fighting the favours Of charlatan saviours, charlatan saviours Rage hard, into the light Rage hard, doing it right, doing it right Rage hard, against the dark Rage hard, make your mark Let the tournament begin Don't give up and don't give in Rage hard, into the light Rage hard, doing it right Rage hard, against the dark Rage hard, make your mark I don't know
