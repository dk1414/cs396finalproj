Turning over in interrupted slumber You ponder others, growing ever wakeful You've locked the vermin in the other bedroom To be so perfect causes you to feel so thankful Now find the fault because your boyfriend can't read Reflecting on to you is that the bitterness you need So unhappy, yet so preoccupied Never found, beaten down, with your forked tongue tied Your eulogy is like poetry But, your mouth is like a magazine Your eulogy is like poetry But, your mouth is like a magazine Queen dependency is cowering, please don't be confused You are vacant and submissive, receptive to abuse Virtue isn't tangible, and sense of self is dated Names constant on your cracked lips are now eviscerated Your spine is made of metal, your veins are 'lectric tape And all along an impulse lights at random in your fa-ace Cough up an offering, forget which words are lies Then your skull echoes a singeing pop, your brain is cauterizedI am made of parts that freeze and ligaments that atrophy Though they look they'll never see They don't know something's wrong with me Just as well, I'll never tell what's underneath my scales I've worn to thin to honor you, my every effort fails Bury me with Israel and cover up my tracks Leave not a trace of what I was, I'm never coming back And if your mercy falls upon he whose blood is cold Unearth me with your hands of love and never break your hold The world is full of ones like me Who need to see the truth But the truth is never truth in me The truth is only you Jesus bless the crocodiles, forgive the cobras and all the snakes Open up your arms to carry all of our mistakes Suck the venom from every bite and vomit every drop Some of us may bite your hand but some of us will not And every knee will bow before you, each forked tongue confess My selfishness will rot in me and I will seek your rest Still some lizards flee from you, ashamed of all they've been So Jesus take myself from me, never bring it back againAfter all of this we've been dismissed By those who prefer to eat dirt We've gladly exempt, we are racked with contempt And we happily wish you this hurt My skull is on fire with barbs and black spires My synapses shriek in the flames Yet we reel with desire though choked by coarse wire We've been loosed by our raging disdain I'm gone, God, help me, I'm done, I'm done Nothing can stop me, I'm done, I'm done No fear, no doubt, I've bottomed out I've lost myself I'm letting go No pride, no me, I've set them free Lost my mind and now I know No pain, no death, they're put to rest We leave them here, we close the door No earth, no man, now take my hand'Cause nothing matters Oh, the stage that we soil, the plans that we foil And the joke that we play on the world And you drown in the oil, all wrapped up in the coils And crushed under the stones that you've hurled Still we march through the tombs through the darkness and gloom And we shatter the columns of bone And the world she breaks for the lives that she takes She weeps as she dies all alone No fear, no doubt, I've bottomed out I've lost myself, I'm letting go No pride, no me, I've set them free Lost my mind and now I know No pain, no death, they're put to rest We leave them here we close the door No earth, no man, now take my hand'Cause nothing matters anymore The world is a husk to be peeled back and torn My body, a shell that now breaks How I long to escape from the chains that I've worn And hasten my greatest escape And when I breathe my very last Don't shed a tear for me Discard the body that once was my prison For I'll have been set free And when the trumpets call us home And I am no longer bedded by pain Our tears will be forever dried For the author of life knows my name So we trample the hoards of the pointless and blank We will die for the truth in our hearts No force that exists will steal us from his hands Nothing will tear us apart Though the mirror is dull, the reflection obscured We look beyond the obtuse And the world weighs down beating us to the ground But her efforts are of little use The anointed one has purchased our souls Death is battered and lifeless before me The truth rains down for the children of Christ And the truth has set us free And through it all we rise when we fall Though the road grows more narrow before me Though we ache, though we cry, never break, never die The one truth there is sets us freeDance with me baby, let me hear your voice If I didn’t wanna fall for you I never had a choice Smear the makeup on my face And run your fingers through my hair Cannot keep my heart from you and I don’t even care Yeah, you turn me inside out, you make me shake and I can’t stop You give new meaning to drop dead gorgeous and I’m about to Drop You are a song to me And every note of every chord will set me free, yeah There’s no time before you came along Three cheers for the end of twenty one years and nothing else is Going wrong Reverberate and complicate my evenings and my days And I will only love you more, well, I will count the ways Dance with me and when you see my pulse beneath my skin It’s racing now, I don’t know how to hold the burning in You’ve taken from me my defenses, my will is under attack And baby when I wrap my arms around you Feel the bones in your backTonight's twilight will be the last Seen by our eyes So if it seems so beautiful Kiss the beauty goodbye Oh, my little cornea Please say that you are no more Ears please swear You did not hear This creaking in the cabin floor I'll forgive my eyes for lovely lies So certainly within my will Please declare this piercing stare So false at a clock sitting still Such pretty skin Give it to us Such pretty skin Give it to us The sun won't rise My spirit dies All hope has withdrawn So here I lay Because either way I know we'll all be dead by dawnWhisper something to me So I can hear your voice I'm pushing you away My will be done, it is my choice You sing to me in inky black With tendrils flailing wildly Yet I remain in solid stone No force on earth can move me Why does it seem that all is slipping further from me I build and build and reaching up my arms cannot reach anything Give me something, anything, why is it bleak and barren Don't I deserve the world After building, building, building, building You dangle happiness before me yet keep it out of reach My well is dry and still I try to fill it up I seek and seek and Nothing lasts except the empty swallowing my soul But I will rise above this world and I will fill my holes My heart and soul belong to me I am my own, my own, my own My heart and soul belong to me I am my own, my own, my ownShall we use needles or knives to realign your spine The tissue degenerates so rapidly Perhaps it proves it is the time to cover your face And smile at me to see if I am out of sight Denying ventricle flow revel in your plight tonight You're such a wonderful person to know And my name will rest in utter disdain My resentment receives its wings for flight You deceitfully stroll on just the same into your holy light With music destroyed, we'll only create noise Sweet dissonance is all that you'll have left We'll dance across its grave The art of singing empty praise with knives of hope and peace stab art to death I've watched it on its drugs And I've seen the doctors shrug cerebellums withered up The heart is black No scalpel, pill or stitch, no religious sales pitch Will ever bring the art that's dying back And so we are the heirs, of this glowing lack of care our hearts in one discord We all cry out for blood and spit we clap, the amps are feeding back My heart is filled with the one to whom I shout And glowing you speak in the friendliest tongue in sentiments of gold And oh the sweetest songs are sung and the sweetest lies are told So spread this virus and seek yourself you pursue it quite relentlessly when Sunday comes You'll raise hands to sing what a glorious sight to seeSomeday they'll write a book about you Because you're so selfish it's funny So self-absorbed, this thunderous horde Of you, you, you So self-absorbed, this thunderous horde Of you, you, you Yeah, I'd love you But you love yourself And you'd love me But I love myself So tense are these nerves in any instance Teeth snap and a toe taps the dirt Cry like a baby and see if then maybe The others will cherish your hurt Never you see a cry or a plea Consider another or first Know this is your world, the harsh words you have hurled Recall you are the one in need worse Yeah, I'd love you But you love yourself And you'd love me But I love myself Yeah, I'd love you But you love yourself And we'd serve you But we serve ourselvesI used to dream that I could fly Just above the whispered clouds Beneath the somber sky I had a dream I was alive I dreamt that love would never die, goodbye Dreams were cheap and hope was easy The forgeries of life deceiving And as I glided to the ground Calcified, the concrete weighed me down Your wings are holding up the sky Dear God, I had dreamt that I could fly Alkaline the burning frost Has blistered deep beneath my bones And winter spat its hatred Cold and coiled, black and deep As it called me ever further Where evil burns and never sleeps I once had prayers that found no words Fragile things I've never spoken Through my lips passed eulogies For all the oaths that I have broken Still the ghost of hope was haunting Through the dark to save the living And still beneath it all I dreamt That God could be forgivingIt's easier to speak your mind when the world loves what you have to say Oh they gyrate their way, they shout when they say:"let us never see the day the sun sets on your heart."But when I am alone in the dark I wonder where I've been, I wonder where I'm going Is part of being strung along being helplessly unknowing And what of the scoundrels who lead the sheep astray Oh they question their masters, their parents and pastors, and in the hereafter They're steeped in the dark And when I am alone, in my heart I wonder where they've been and where they're going Is part of rebellion conceit of the unknowing Is it difficult to speak your mind when the world hates the things you have to say Oh they screech and they bray, there is doubt and dismay, may the sun set on this day When you dragged all of them effortlessly straight into the dark While they where there they wondered:What if the kings that we've put on their thrones aren't really kings at all What if they should fall And all of the false gods that we're prostrated before have no gracious reign in mind What if we wake up to find ourselves coiled in their ashes We will finally start to wonder what it is that we should leave behind We'll see the signs and realize there's never been a better time to overthrow the principalities In all our words, in all our deeds And storm the gates of hell to show them they will not prevail If all our hopes and all our dreams fall on deaf ears Then let them see The gates of hell will not prevail And you've broken the chains on me
