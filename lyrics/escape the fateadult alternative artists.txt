Hurtful words from my enemies of the last five years What's it like to die alone And how does it feel when tears freeze when you cry The blood in your veins is twenty below Sitting in this room playing Russian roulette Finger on the trigger to my dear Juliet Out from the window, see her backdrop silhouette This blood on my hands is something I cannot forget Sitting in this room playing Russian roulette Finger on the trigger to my dear Juliet Out from the window, see her backdrop silhouette This blood on my hands is something I cannot forget Something I cannot forget So for now, take this down a notch Crash my car through your window Make sure you're still alive Just in time to kill you Sitting in this room playing Russian roulette Finger on the trigger to my dear Juliet Out from the window, see her backdrop silhouette This blood on my hands is something I cannot forget Sitting in this room playing Russian roulette Finger on the trigger to my dear Juliet Out from the window, see her backdrop silhouette This blood on my hands is something I cannot forget Something I cannot forgetAre you ready Are you ready Are you ready Are you ready Let's go!Everybody in the world are you

Let's go I'm letting go'Cause I can't take this anymore Since you broke my heart in two I've been a little crazy lately I've been out of my head I remember every word you ever said And, oh, I, I never thought you would betray me A whole lotta regret I cannot believe we're coming to an end And now you got me feeling so damn low I'm letting go'Cause I can't take this anymore Since you broke my heart in two And now I know That you don't love me anymore So take my broken heart with you I've been a little lonely lately I can't sleep in this bed I remember every night we ever spent And, oh, I'm hearing every word you told me It's stuck in my head All your promises were broken in the endThe situations are irrelevant now She loves the way that I tease I love the way that she breathes I touched her ooh, she touched my ahhh, it was the craziest thing I love the girls who hate to love because they're just like me A certain girl she took my hand and ran it up her thigh She licked her lips and pulled my hair, I fall in love for a night She can't behave and I'm just a slave Donâ€™t worry I'll be gone when the morning comes Darling what is going on Honestly that never happened Lying is your favorite passion Leave me, go where you belong Higher heels and lipstick napkins Dying is your latest fashion The frustration it's a regular thing I hate the ones who love to hate because they're just like me A certain girl she took her hand and put it in my lap"It's way too full," she said"Once you have me you'll always come back."This is for the ones with words unspoken This is for the ones dealing with hearts broken I can't believe everything I see A world full of hate and of vanity With so much beauty and love inside me When does our innocence turn into arrogance I am strong, I am weak I am everything between I am proud to be me I am human I am weird, I'm a freak I am different, I'm unique I will love who I please I am human You are just like me You are just like me Faith is so much stronger than fear Open your heart to the truth you might hear Taste your words before you spit them out Silence can be louder than a shout There's so much beauty and love inside us When does our innocence turn into arrogance There's a place that I've found As far as I can see This place lies within The depths of my dreams In a garden surrounded By fire and trees Through the smoke a silhouette I can barely see There's a man with an axe Standing in the rain Looked me straight in my eye This is what he had to say Never fall asleep You won't wake up Destroy the guillotine Before he does I walk with shadows I walk with shadows Hiding from the gallows So I walk in shadows You lived your life like you were on fire But how can I dance when your soul just lifted me higher and higher and higher Paint bleeds, ink runs, image of your love Your memory, our history I'd give up my eyes to see you one last time And I'd give all my fingertips to touch you And I could paint you picture perfect even if I were blinded But you had to die for me to see how to live I lived my life hiding in shadows but now I can see Cause your soul is lifting me higher and higher and higher Paint bleeds, I can't breathe, need you here with me Close my eyes I can feel you close I'd give up my eyes to see you one last time And I'd give all my fingertips to touch you And I could paint you picture perfect even if I were blinded But you had to die for me to see how to liveOh my god, I have the remedy for love I struck the glass and broke the bones inside my fist, but I'm ok I cannot change you You'll never change I never would expect to break this in the end Something so profound, something you won't expect Take this scripture like a picture and wear it around your neck The sky it opens up Don't get swallowed by the flames What's mine is yours and yours is mine so take me away You hear the sounds, they're carried out There's no sympathy for the dead It swells and I, was never the same There's no sympathy for the dead We dance like zombies do in the middle of the rain We see the stones falling from the sky The blinding light beaming from your eyes Life has died, yet we're still alive and down below A sea of damned crashing like a tidal wave, waveMother, where are you today You took a piece of me the day you went away No recollection or the smell of your perfume I took a piece of you the day I left the womb Brother, put your needles down The best thing for you is to leave this awful town Pretty soon, you'll have kids to feed If you see mother, tell her I can sing Please don't worry, I am doing fine You're much too busy to even find the time So use your chemicals and take this to your grave The boys you left are men you didn't raise And daddy, how are you today You must be proud of the boys that you have raised Your withered heart, and everything it's seen Your cuts and calloused hands, you had kids to feed You had kids to feedSo lock and load mercenaries I see the smoke from the hilltop They march one by one The battled starts adversaries We bathe in our blood The worst is yet to come We've reached the covenant To kill what we have started Kill the machines We've spawned to fight in the darkest hour They really need to know We really gotta go They really need to know We really gotta go We stay here tonight Promise me you won't leave my side And when the sun comes up we fight So promise me you won't leave my side
