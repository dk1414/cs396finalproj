I've seen the world, done it all Had my cake now Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now Hot summer nights, mid-July When you and I were forever wild The crazy days, city lights The way you'd play with me like a child Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now Channeling angels in the new age now Hot summer days, rock and roll The way you'd play for me at your show And all the ways I got to know Your pretty face and electric soul Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful Kiss me hard before you go Summertime sadness I just wanted you to know That, baby, you the best I got my red dress on tonight Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style High heels off, I'm feelin' alive Oh, my God, I feel it in the air Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere Nothin' scares me anymore Kiss me hard before you go Summertime sadness I just wanted you to know That, baby, you the best I got that summertime, summertime sadness Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness Got that summertime, summertime sadness Oh, oh-oh-oh-ohLook at you, kids, with your vintage music Comin' through satellites while cruisin'You're part of the past, but now you're the future Signals crossing can get confusin'It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy Sometimes it's enough just to make you feel crazy You get ready, you get all dressed up To go nowhere in particular Back to work or the coffee shop Doesn't matter 'cause it's enough To be young and in love, ah, ah To be young and in love, ah, ah Look at you, kids, you know you're the coolest The world is yours and you can't refuse it Seen so much, you could get the blues, but That don't mean that you should abuse it Though it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazyDown on the West coast, they got a sayin'"If you're not drinkin', then you're not playin'"But you've got the music

falling hard, I push away, I'm feelin' hot to the touch You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much But something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive, I'm a lush Your love, your love, my love I can see my baby swinging His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up On the balcony and I'm singing Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love I can see my sweet boy swaying He's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la On the balcony and I'm saying Move, baby, move, baby, I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love Climb up the H of the Hollywood sign In these stolen moments, the world is mine There's nobody here, just us together Keepin' me hot like July forever'Cause we're the masters of our own fate We're the captains of our own souls There's no way for us to come late'Cause, boy, we're gold, boy, we're gold And I was like...Take off, take off, take off all your clothes Take off, take off, take off all your clothes Take off, take off, take off all of your clothes They say only the good die young That just ain't right'Cause we're having too much fun Too much fun tonight And a lust for life, and a lust for life And a lust for life, and a lust for life Keeps us alive, keeps us alive Keeps us alive, keeps us alive And a lust for life, and a lust for life And a lust for life, and a lust for life Keeps us alive, keeps us alive Keeps us alive, keeps us aliveSwingin' in the backyard, pull up in your fast car Whistlin' my name Open up a beer and you say, "Get over here And play a video game"I'm in his favorite sundress, watching me get undressed Take that body downtown I say, "You the bestest," lean in for a big kiss Put his favorite perfume on"Go play your video game"It's you, it's you, it's all for you Everything I do I tell you all the time Heaven is a place on Earth with you Tell me all the things you wanna do I heard that you like the bad girls, honey Is that true It's better than I ever even knew They say that the world was built for two Only worth living if somebody is loving you And baby, now, you do Hm-mmWhy  Who, me  Why  Feet don't fail me now Take me to the finish line Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take But I'm hoping at the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design I feel so alone on a Friday night Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine It's like I told you, honey Don't make me sad, don't make me cry Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough I don't know why Keep making me laugh—let's go get high The road is long, we carry on Try to have fun in the meantime Come and take a walk on the wild side Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain You like your girls insane Choose your last words, this is the last time'Cause you and I—we were born to dieGoddamn, man-child You fucked me so good that I almost said "I love you"You're fun and you’re wild But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through Your poetry's bad and you blame the news But I can’t change that, and I can't change your mood, ah'Cause you're just a man It's just what you do Your head in your hands As you color me blue Yeah, you're just a man All through and through Your head in your hands As you color me blue Blue, blue, blue Goddamn, man-child You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon know-it-all You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you But I don't get bored, I just see it through Why wait for the best when I could have you  You I was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like All of these debutantes Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts But I'm not, baby, I'm not No, I'm not, that, I'm not I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown24/7 Sylvia Plath Writing in blood on my walls'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not But at best, I can say I'm not sad'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have I had 15-year dances Church basement romances, yeah, I've cried Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums Is the only love I've ever known Except for the stage, which I also call home, when I'm not Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the i Pad Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, "Hi, Dad"High, high High, high Boy, look at you lookin' at me I know you know how I feel Lovin' you is hard, bein' here's harder You take the wheel I don't wanna do this anymore It's so surreal I can't survive If this is all that's real All I wanna do is get high by the beach Get high by the beach, get high All I wanna do is get by by the beach Get by, baby, baby, bye-bye The truth is I never bought into your bullshit When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that All I wanted to do was get high by the beach Get high, baby, baby, bye-bye Boy, look at you lookin' at me I know you don't understand You could be a bad motherfucker But that don't make you a man Now you're just another one of my problems Because you got out of hand We won't survive We're sinkin' into the sand
