I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees'Cause I, I want honey on my table I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees'Cause I, I want honey on my table But I never get it right No, I never get it right I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees I can't understand why they're stinging me But I'll do what I want, I'll do what I please I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need I'll rip and smash through the hornet's nest Do you understand I deserve the best And I'll do what I want, I'll do what I please I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need I try to stick this pin through a butterfly'Cause I, I like all the pretty colors It just fell apart, so I flung it in the fire To burn with all the othersThose flowers I found you Were the truest red that I'd ever seen'Til you cut yourself on their thorns You winced and I kissed you And I kissed your palms and we both laughed So unaware of the gathering storm It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain'Til the levee breaks A tidal wave of fear and pain carries us away Another fight into the night Until nothing else remains How do we find harbor from the hurricane Now sheltered in shadows The quiet song of your breath stirs the dark Your skin like a rose 'neath my hand And I can't keep from wondering Why nothing good can ever stay Why faith feels like a fistful of sand It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain'Til the levee breaks A tidal wave of fear and pain carries us away Another fight into the night Until nothing else remains How do we find harbor from the hurricane It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain'Til the levee breaks A tidal wave of fear and pain carries us away Another fight into the night Until nothing else remains How do we find harbor from the hurricane Late night, brakes lock, hear the tires squeal Red light, can't stop so I spin the wheel My world goes black before I feel an angel lift me up And I open bloodshot eyes into fluorescent white They flip the siren, hit the lights Close the doors and I am gone Now I lay here owing my life to a stranger And I realize that empty words are not enough I'm left here with the question of just What have I to show except The promises I never kept I lie here shaking on this bed Under the weight of my regrets I hope that I will never let you down I know that this can be more than just Flashing lights and sound Look around and you'll see that at times It feels like no one really cares It gets me down but I'm still gonna try to do what's right I know that there's A difference between sleight of hand And giving everything you have There's a line drawn in the sand I'm working up the will to cross itSomewhere down the way, there's a hidden place that anyone That all of us could find But all our maps have failed, so venture through the veil and realize That these roads are intertwined Far beyond those walls, gleaming black and white Further than our false schemes of wrong and right Is a field where we can walk Leaving all our names behind I will meet you there, beyond the pines Templed in twilight or dawn The light and easy air Tracing the lines on our palms Somewhere down the road is a place that we can go where everyone And everything is divine And when we're all awake, we can finally make an end of these Divisions in our minds Far beyond those walls, gleaming black and white Further than our false schemes of wrong and right Is a field where we can walk Leaving all our names behind I will meet you there, beyond the pines Templed in twilight or dawn The light and easy air Tracing the lines on our palmsThe tyranny of deterioration It worries me that it's all just a waste of time Taking one step forward, two steps back Still I believe there's a thread through the thorns Yeah I believe that somewhere it's warm And I believe that it's ever bright beyond this black So keep holding on to hope without assurance Holding on to a memory of light But will the morning come For all I know we’ll never see the sun But together we’ll fight the long defeat The suffering that I see all around It's enough to keep me crashing down till I I lie wrecked and reeling from these falls Still I believe there's a word in the wire And I believe there's a way through the fire And I believe there's a joy that blooms beyond these walls So keep holding on to hope without assurance Holding on to a memory of light But will the morning come For all I know we’ll never see the sun But together we’ll fight the long defeatThere was a time when I tried to hold the ocean in my fists When I mistook the language for the light There was a tightness that gripped my soul and bubbled at my wrists And choked me within inches of my life But now I'm letting go And I can finally breathe, I can finally breathe And my hands are open, reaching out I'm learning how to live with doubt I'm learning how to lean into the grey'Cause I've had enough of black and white I'll find another way and I will lean into the grey I'll lean into the grey There was a time when I tried to bind and bottle up the sea I tried to hide my heart inside my head There was a maze of these vicious lines that cut through everything I pulled against them till my body bled But now I'm letting go And I can finally breathe, I can finally breatheYou were a silhouette, shimmering shadow in the mingled ash and snow I took your fevered hands - felt like embers of the world's dying glow And you were feather light as I carried you quietly through the crumbling streets And in the fading light I could see in your eyes that somehow we were meant to meet But would you stay with me If you thought the war was over And everything made right Would you still believe in us Or would your love for me grow colder With no one left to fight Would you stay with me Would you stay with me After the fever left, together we'd scavenge through the city and her scars And when the day would end, bar the door against the demons and the dark We'd share a can of something and the bottle of bourbon I had hid away It'd warm me from within and you from without till I forget the chill and gray Would you stay with me If you thought the war was over And everything made right Would you still believe in us Or would your love for me grow colder With no one left to fight The sky took its cue, every color and hue on display Till thick veils of indigo signaled the end of the day But each landscape that lies in the mirror of your eyes turns to grey Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh On the edge of a knife, it's like you're living your life on the stage You're talking through glass, we're just square photographs on a page Oh, we're never alone but we're each in our own little cage Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh You're here but it's clear you're just salt and shadow Here, but half a world away You're here, but you're merely a hologram Here, still so far away Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh You manage to hide even here by my side where we lay Here on this bed where I sense every thread start to fray And I feel our skin touch but there's only so much it can sayI see through your eyes You breathe with my lungs I strain with your ear to make out The words your mother sung I bless with your hand You pray on my knees It's my blood in your veins And your heart is beating in me Finally when will it be enough To find there's no them There is only us There's only us I strike with your fist You shoot with my gun We spit in your face with my mouth And curse me with your tongue We cast us aside We silence our plea But the system that terrifies you Should terrify me]We wave our flags, we swallow fear like medicine We kiss the hands of profiteers and their congressmen But I've seen too much I've had enough To raise a shout, to make it clear This has to end There's blood on the sand, there's blood in the street And there's a gun in my hand, or there might as well be And I'm sick of it — I'm so sick of this]We panic at the sight of different-colored skin And we've got a plan to justify each mess we're in But I've seen too much I've had enough To take a stand, to make it right — this has to end There's blood on the sand, there's blood in the street And there's a gun in my hand, or there might as well be And I'm sick of it — I'm so sick of this Fear will kill your mind and steal your love as sure as anything Fear will rob you blind and make you numb to others' suffering And I've felt its touch too many times and I've had enough I've had enough
