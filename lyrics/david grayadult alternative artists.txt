Friday night I'm going nowhere All the lights are changing green to red Turning over T V stations Situations running through my head Looking back through time You know it's clear that I've been blind I've been a fool To open up my heart To all that jealousy, that bitterness, that ridicule Saturday I'm running wild And all the lights are changing red to green Moving through the crowds I'm pushing Chemicals are rushing in my bloodstream Only wish that you were here You know I'm seeing it so clear I've been afraid To show you how I really feel Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made If you want it Come and get it For crying out loud The love that I was Giving you was Never in doubt Let go your heart Let go your head And feel it now Let go your heart Let go your head And feel it now Babylon, Babylon, BabylonThis year's love had better last Heaven knows it's high time I've been waiting on my own Too long And when you hold me like you do It feels so right, oh now I start to forget how my heart gets torn When that hurt gets thrown Feeling like you can't go on Turning circles and time again Cut like a knife, oh now If ya love me got to know For sure'Cause it takes something more this time Than sweet, sweet lies, oh now Before I open up my arms and fall Losing all control Every dream inside my soul When ya kiss me on that midnight street Sweep me off my feet Singing ain't this life so sweetPlease forgive me If I act a little strange For I know not what I do Feels like lightning running through my veins Every time I look at you Every time I look at you Help me out here All my words are falling short And there's so much I want to say Wanna tell you just how good it feels When you look at me that way When you look at me that way Throw a stone and watch the ripples flow Moving out across the bay Like a stone I fall into your eyes Deep into that mystery Deep into some mystery I got half a mind to scream out loud I got half a mind to die So I won't ever have to lose you, girl Won't ever have to say goodbye I won't ever have to lie Won't ever have to say goodbyeSail away with me honey I put my heart in your hands Sail away with me honey now, now, now Sail away with me What will be, will be I wanna hold you now, now, now Crazy skies all wild above me now Winter howling at my face And everything I held so dear Disappeared without a trace Oh all the times I've tasted love Never knew quite what I had Little Darling, if you hear me now Never needed you so bad Spinning round inside my head Sail away with me honey I put my heart in your hands Sail away with me honey now, now, now Sail away with me What will be will be I wanna hold you now, now, nowStandin' at the door of the pink Flamingo cryin' in the rain It was a kind of so-so love and I'm gonna make sure it doesn't happen again You and I had to be the standing joke of the year You were a run-around, a lost and found and not for me I feel Take your hands off me, hey I don't belong to you, you see And take a look in my face, for the last time I never knew you, you never knew me Say hello, goodbye Say hello and wave goodbye We tried to make it work, you in a cocktail skirt and me in a suit but it just wasn't me You're used to wearing less, and now your life's a mess, so insecure you see I put up with all the scenes, this is one scene that's goin' to be played my way Take your hands off me, hey I don't belong to you, you see And take a look in my face, for the last time I never knew you, you never knew me Say hello, goodbye Say hello and wave goodbye Say hello and wave goodbye Under the deep red light I can see the make-up slidin' down Well hey little girl you will always make up so take off that unbecoming frown As for me, well I'll find someone who's not goin' cheap in the sales A nice little housewife, who'll give me a steady life and not keep going off the railsGonna lay down in the grass And watch that acorn split in two, slowly take root While the clock upon the wall makes idle boasts And my mind's out cruising silent coasts Though the ghosts of better days might twist my eyes Gonna stand my ground, watch that sapling rise Just as long as I’ve the strength, well, I'll raise that flag Like a wisp of cloud from a mountain crag Now this is awkward I kept it bottled up too long Years like tiny drops of rain on a glassy lake Leaving naught but circles in their wake Though we barely comprehend what the question is Only know for certain, the answer’s yes Now this is awkward Really don’t know where to beginIf skin should touch and words evaporate Trouble clear out of sight with my whole body listening My heart leans out like these old river trees Closer to be where you glide, moving under me, glistening If 8 were 9, I would hold you Yeah, I would rock you I would shelter you, darling If 8 were 9, I would lift you Lift you clear off the ground Through the gates into morning The time would stretch Stretch out these magic hours Into days, into years Tomorrow lost in the distance A voice speaks out Says, "Hey man, let it go"But when a heart has been true Well, it don't make any difference If 8 were 9, I would hold you I would rock you I would shelter you, darling If 8 were 9, I would lift you Lift you clear off the ground Through the gates into morning If 8 were 9 If 8 were 9 If 8 were 9 If 8 were 9 Through the gates into morning, yeahIn search of sleep, I close my eyes My head is filled with bugs and flies I don't know if you realise How much it means Pray, tell me where that feeling went I gave my best by accident In vain, I stride to represent How much it means How much it means How much it means Am I lost for words My mind heads forward It's gone the moment I reach the walls Gets grounded up on top Still I'm trying to hold it up It's people who have lost their faith Who speak of life, but play it safe Arise, dear fool The days breathe Don't you seeAh, to be lost, however briefly Lost in a place, yeah, such as this Was to be free of the shackles of the known roads Yeah, to be free of all that is I cleaved to the wind and I saw it far beneath me The whale of a lie, something blue among the trees The face of the wave that stole my breath as it engulfed me The print of my eye on all it sees Deaf to reason, calling out to me Deaf to reason, crying out Deaf to reason, calling out to me She spoke and my head was full of murmurs like a green field That last that we saw, he disappeared into clouds Should that moment arise, well I’ll be running, I’ll be spring heeled The taste of your words inside my mouth The taste of your words inside my mouth The taste of your words inside my mouth Deaf to reason, calling out to me Deaf to reason, crying out Deaf to reason, calling out to meFrom the very first moment I saw you That's when I knew All the dreams I held in my heart Had suddenly come true Knock me over stone cold sober Not a thing I could say or do'Cos baby when I'm walking with you now My eyes are so wide Like you reached right into my head And turned on the light inside Turning on the light Inside my mind hey Come on baby it's all right Sunday, Monday, day or night Written blue on white it's plain to see That rainy, shiny, night or day What's the difference anyway Honey till your heart belongs to me If I had some influence girl With the powers that be I'd have them fire that arrow at you Like they fired it right at me
