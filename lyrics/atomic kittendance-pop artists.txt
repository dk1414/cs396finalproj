back on when we first met I cannot escape and I cannot forget Baby you're the one, you still turn me on You can make me whole again Time is laying heavy on my heart Seems I've got too much of it Since we've been apart My friends make me smile If only for a while You can make me whole againCall my name Call my name Close your eyes Give me your hand, darling Do you feel my heart beating Do you understand Do you feel the same Or am I only dreaming Is this burning an eternal flame I believe it's meant to be, darling I watch you when you are sleeping You belong with me Do you feel the same Am I only dreaming But is this burning An eternal flame  Say my name Sun shines through the rain A whole life so lonely And then you come and ease the pain I don't want to lose this feeling, ohIf you see

But now I know That you got your love around me You know it makes me feel so strong Baby, if you turn around And prove to me it's real Maybe we can work it out'Cause this is how I feel Do you know When you go, when you give it all away I'll be there for you, care for you Love you everyday, oh, baby And do you feel the same for me Any day you're away and I feel a little low I would cry for you, die for you Just to let you know, oh, baby And if you come to me, you know I'll make it right Throughout my life I'd never thought I'd have somebody Someone to call my own And now I've found A little bit of heaven, baby A place to call my homeI will rock you like a baby, lover Cradled in my arms I will keep you safe from danger Shelter you from harm There will never be another lover Who treats you like I do We can drift into forever On a love that's made for two Don't you ever say this loves not special Don't you ever think it's not essential, baby I was only thinking of you Hoping you were thinking of me Two hearts beating just like one Against the world, baby I am always dreaming of you Hoping you are dreaming of me I could never live One day without your love I will kiss you like an angel, baby Cradled in my wings I will take you up to heaven Show you precious things If you promise that you love me If you promise that you care I will be here for you always And forever this I swearYou and I once shared love So strong and so secure But all you left are memories The feelings are no more Like flowers in a big field All died and blown away The letters and the pictures Are all that will remain But every moment Of every day I wanna see you I wanna say No one loves you, like I love you No one needs you, the way I do No one knows you, like I know you No one hears you, the way I do So many years of memories Suppressed beyond recall The feelings once unbroken Seem silent and so small
