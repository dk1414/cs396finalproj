I've never been too good with names The cellar door was open, I could never stay away I know it's prob'ly not my place It's either or, I'm hoping for a simple way to say It's a shame about Ray In the stone, under the dust His name is still engraved Some things need to go away It's a shame about Ray If I make it through today I'll know tomorrow not to leave my feelings out on display I'll put the cobwebs back in place I've never been too good with names But I remember facesWaiting for some thin' to break Left my heart out to bake Nothing there in my glass Wasn't air meant to last Hope in my past Hope in my past Hope in my past{Play verse chords}All the way down to the lake How much more could I take Walked back home to my place Guess I don't wanna die Hope in my past Hope in my past Hope in my past Hope in my past Hope in my past Hope in my past Waiting for some thin' to break Left my heart out to bakeShe's coming over We'll go out walking Make a call on the way She's in the phone booth now I'm looking in There comes a smile on her face There's still some of the same stuff we got yesterday There's still some of the same stuff we got yesterday Yeah I'm too much with myself I wanna be someone else I'm too much with myself I wanna be someone else I'm too much with myself I wanna be someone else So we take off out Fiona's door Walk until it's light outside Like before when we were on the phone We have to laugh to look at each other We have to laugh 'cause we're not aloneHalf past 9 Quarter to 1010:15 and we're comin' around again Hold off are we going soft Flushed my Zoloft And we're comin' around again Found out and I almost drowned Walked back down And we're comin' around again If I could talk I'd tell you If I could smile I'd let you know You are far and away My most imaginary friend If I could talk I'd tell you When I can smile I'll let you know If I could talk I'd tell you Khmer Rouge genocide quoi Your place or Mein Kampf Now I'm giving the dog a bone Slight hunch without the vaguest clue To keep the blood balance Now we're comin' around again Half past 9 Quarter to 210:15 And we're comin' around againIf I was in the fridge, would you open the door If I was the grass, would you mow your lawn If I was your body, would you still wear clothes If I was a booger, would you blow your nose Where would you keep it  Would you eat it I'm just tryna give myself a reason For being around If I was the front porch swing, would you let me hang If I was the dance floor, would you shake your thing If I was a rubber check, would you let me bounce Up and down inside your bank account Would you trust me not to break you I'm just tryin' real hard to make you Notice me being around If I was a haircut, would you wear a hat If I was a maid, could I clean your flat If I was the carpet, would you wipe your feet In time to save me from mud off the street If you liked me, if you loved me Would you get down on your knees and scrub me I'm a little grubby Just being aroundAlways had a roof above me Always paid the rent But I never set foot inside a tent I couldn't build fire to save my life I lied about being the outdoor type I never slept out underneath the stars The closest that I came to that Was one time my car broke down for an hour In the suburbs at night I lied about being the outdoor type Too scared to let you know You knew what you were looking for I lied until I fit the bill God bless the great indoors I lied about being the outdoor type I've never owned a sleeping bag Let alone a mountain bike I can't go away with you on a rock climbing weekend What if something's on tv, and it's never shown again Just is well I'm not invited I'm afraid of heights I lied about being the outdoor type Never learned to swim Can't grow a beard or even fight I lied about being the outdoor typeI want a bit part in your life A walk-on would be fine I just want a bit part in your life I want a bit part in your life Rehearsing all the time I just want a bit part in your life Little more than a cameo Nothing traumatic when I go Litle more than a stand-in I won't need reprimandingTake a look into some big gray eyes And ask yourself, you wanna make 'em cry Lookin' out of them, it's just as well But you gon' live to see, I'm gonna ask you why Either way, you got a bone to pick Can't you leave that to somebody else I don't need you to suck my dick Or to help me feel good about myself Big gay heart Please don't break my big gay heart Big gay heart Please don't break my big gay heart Why can't you look after yourself and not down on me Do you have to try to piss me off 'cause I'm easy to please Why can't you look after yourself and not down on me Yeah, wow, I understand now you're not with the big gay scene If you can find a way to add it up It might be hard, but it might be enough I'd be grateful, I'd be satisfied And you might find in time, it wouldn't feel so bad After all, it doesn't take that much And it would mean some to me For you to lose the part that's still afraid And not prepared to seeI know a place where I can go When I'm alone Into your arms ooh oh ooh Into your arms I can go I know a place that's safe and warm From the crowd Into your arms ooh oh ooh Into your arms I can go And if I should fall I know I won't be alone Be alone anymore I know a place where I can go When I'm alone Into your arms ooh oh ooh Into your arms I can go I know a place that's safe and warm From the crowd Into your arms ooh oh ooh Into your arms I can goHe kinda shoulda sorta woulda loved her if he could've The story's
