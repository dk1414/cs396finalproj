This is the return of I dread her slipping down Rest of song is a woman vocalizingWhen your heart is full of doubt And you're lonely in the crowd And your worries lost all hope We're under the same sun.. Bad day shadows my flow Troubles of this world A hard path to my door Walking through the streets Tail lights bleeding all over my feet Wind like a rusted razor cuttin' lines in my face this deep I see a reborn ghost  And every passing glance Some things can't be held no matter how firm your grasp You'll never find religion in a perfectly clean soul You'll never find religion in a bottom of a bucket with a big ole' hole Clogged arteries This world keeps time with no beating heart I see it everywhere I go brother how it tears us all apart There's less space in each of our souls than on a Manhattan subway car at rush hour If you wanna buy back a little mercy you better first look at the price you gotta pay Missed her so much that you been sleeping in her shoes You ain't go the blues brother, cause it's the blues that got you You can't find religion, not in a perfectly clean soul You can't find religion at the bottom of abucket with big ole' hole Jack of diamons buried deep up my longest sleeve Through the rain and ghetto cross the rotting concrete I go there to find my people, say a prayer upon their sins The virgin Mary, she got a supple bosom and fresh ink in her skin Alone in the crowd here Across your forehead fallin like a Dark ribbon in a highway opening up Swinging a hammer in society's dark chaingang I coulda sworn i hear somebody sayLate and lovely ease your mind For your hand is not needed here tonight Feel your heart beat slow it down While there's no need to rush So stop thinking of things to do Steal a moment, take a few Sit back and enjoy the view You got to learn how to loose control Time for change the brief I give you love like you give to me When in your mind you say ready But in your heart you say take it slow You got to take it slow, take it slow Late and lovely i'm for you You can do what you want with me it's true Sing your song play your tune I'll just want you to know how much you means so So stop thinking of things to do Steal a moment, take a few Sit back and enjoy the view You got to learn how to loose control Time for change the brief I give you love like you give to me When in your mind you say ready But in your heart you say take it slow You got to take it slow, take it slow12Stayin' up all night This could be a party I've got some friends outside Lookin' for a good time You better head my way This is where it's starting No rules, no laws, no gifts tonight You've gotta stay Hey girl, hold me tight Ooo, the night ain't over Hey girl, hit that light Ooo, the night ain't over I'm stayin' up all night This could a showdown I've got this thing inside Tellin' me, don't run and hide And there's so many roads Only you can go down Don't close your eyes There just might be another way Hey girl, hold me tight Ooo, the night ain't over Hey girl, hit that light Ooo, the night ain't over Ooo, I might be losin' my soul Life's only fun when it's dangerous And I don't wanna be told I won't play safe and start growin' old It's five in the mornin'I can feel the beads of sweat Runnin' down the back of my neck It's so good to be with you again, woh Someday, wait and see This will be just a memory And I'll look back with no regrets Good times like this, I can't forget Hey girl, hold me tight Ooo the night ain't over Hey girl, hit that light Ooo, the night ain't over Hey girl, hold me tight Ooo the night ain't over Hey girl, hit that light Ooo, the night ain't over Hey girl, ooo the night ain't over Hey girl, ooo the night ain't over Hey girl, ooo the night ain't overThis is the return of I dread her slipping down Rest of song is a woman vocalizingWhen your heart is full of doubt And you're lonely in the crowd And your worries lost all hope We're under the same sun..
