Last night I had the strangest dream I'd ever had before I dreamed the world had all agreed To put an end to war I dreamed I saw a mighty room And the room was filled with men And the paper they were signing said They'd never fight again And when the papers was all signed And a million copies made They all joined hands and bowed their heads And grateful pray'rs were prayed And the people in the streets below Were dancing 'round and 'round And guns and swords and uniforms Were scattered on the ground Last night I had the strangest dream I'd ever had before I dreamed the world had all agreed To put an end to warAs I rode into Tombstone on my horse whose name was Mac I saw what I relate to you goin' on behind my back It seems the folks were up in arms a man now had to die For believin' things that didn't fit the laws they'd set aside The man's name was I'm a freak the best that I could see He was an executioner a hangman just like me I guess that he'd seen loopholes from workin' with his rope He'd hung the wrong man many times so now he turned to hope He'd talk to all the people from his scaffold in the square He told them of the things he found;But they didn't seem to care He said the laws were obsolete, a change they should demand But the people only walked away, he couldn't understand The Marshall's name was Uncle Sam he said he'd right this wrong He'd make the hangman shut his mouth if it took him all year long He finally arrested Freak and then he sent for me To hang a fellow hangman from a fellow hangman's tree It didn't take them long to try him in their court of law He was guilty then of thinking a crime much worse than all They sentenced him to die so his seed of thought can't spread And infect the little children; that's what the law had said So the hangin' day came 'round and he walked up to the noose I pulled the lever but before he fell I cut him loose They called it all conspiracy and that I had to die So to close our mouths and kill our minds they hung us side by sideMy shadow left my mind and went a walkin' 'round and found a nickel on the ground And the buffalo upon one side he got up and walked away And the indian upon the other side gave out a sigh and said thats better now Without the buffalo Without the buffalo x 2 Without the buffalo im just and indian I'm free and clear The indian went walkin' 'round and sat upon the Hill to watch the sun go down But he couldn't find his people, he got up and walked away And he sat beside the fire, and gave out a sigh We're all forgotten now Where is my tomahawk My days are gone Where is my tent Where is my planting ground Where is my land This reservation's wrong Whose this white man My people never smile Where is my brother My children ignorant Where is my squaw Where's my buffaloC HO RU S:Hear the Voice of Change, hear the winds of movin' on...Hear the Song of not the same thing, hey...Hey, you there in the tie, let me Bend your ear if that's okay..You've been sitting there staring at the Ground for almost three days Ain't sure what I'll say, but I'm thinkin'About the people givin' orders...C HO RU S:Hear the Voice of Change, hear the winds of movin' on...Hear the song of not the same thing Hey...Hey, Business Man, you're turnin' t' give me a sideways Glance every now and then But now your kind is in the papers You've got To think now friend How does that grab your signed-up majority Are you Worried about the people giving orders Last night I had the strangest dream I'd ever had before I dreamed the world had all agreed To put an end to war I dreamed I saw a mighty room And the room was filled with men And the paper they were signing said They'd never fight again And when the papers was all signed And a million copies made They all joined hands and bowed their heads And grateful pray'rs were prayed And the people in the streets below Were dancing 'round and 'round And guns and swords and uniforms Were scattered on the ground Last night I had the strangest dream I'd ever had before I dreamed the world had all agreed To put an end to warAs I rode into Tombstone on my horse whose name was Mac I saw what I relate to you goin' on behind my back It seems the folks were up in arms a man now had to die For believin' things that didn't fit the laws they'd set aside The man's name was I'm a freak the best that I could see He was an executioner a hangman just like me I guess that he'd seen loopholes from workin' with his rope He'd hung the wrong man many times so now he turned to hope He'd talk to all the people from his scaffold in the square He told them of the things he found;But they didn't seem to care He said the laws were obsolete, a change they should demand But the people only walked away, he couldn't understand The Marshall's name was Uncle Sam he said he'd right this wrong He'd make the hangman shut his mouth if it took him all year long He finally arrested Freak and then he sent for me To hang a fellow hangman from a fellow hangman's tree It didn't take them long to try him in their court of law He was guilty then of thinking a crime much worse than all They sentenced him to die so his seed of thought can't spread And infect the little children;
