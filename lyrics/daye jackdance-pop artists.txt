I'm feeling broken Hopeless No one to hold me Love me The world so controlling I'll show ya People been dying Crying Living with my head down Hands up No no don't shoot don't shoot No no don't shoot Living with my head down Hands up No no don't shoot don't shoot No no don't shoot I want to live forever angel here to hold my head up Don aggravated man in blue my death is on the schedule Looking at a mirror skin is burning living in a kettle Grew up in a melting pot black child going mental Brothers underground who's next feel the venom These snakes ain't tame moving independent  Without a leash, all my niggas falling by the several Calling on a angel at the pearly gate saying helloTold myself you gotta free that guy The one inside who'll never be denied Fuck the lies fake bros they

counterfeit kicks And the kind of kid that could count at the counter dollars and bitch Wasn't caught up in fighting but fought for progress, a stitch Could've balled with ballers, played soccer and got the honors And called my mama, It's ringing, the product of practicing Be the garnish for saucing up niggas and winning quick I was gunning for goals with the shot and the cross I hit Could've traveled the seas in a season and saw the world with assists And a class of girls with my draws, bras and tits I was aiming to live I was angry and quit Hello here goes the ring but I'm kidding I
