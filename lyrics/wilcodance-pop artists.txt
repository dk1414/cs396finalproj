How to get to Hadestown:You have to take the long way down Through the underground, under cover of night Layin' low, stayin' out of sight Ain't no compass, brother, ain't no map Just a telephone wire and a railroad track Keep on walkin' and don't look back'Til you get to the bottomland Wait for me, I'm comin'Wait, I'm comin' with you Wait for me, I'm comin' too I'm coming too The River Styx is high and wide Cinder bricks and razor wire Walls of iron and concrete Hound dogs howling 'round the gate Those dogs'll lay down and play dead If you got the bones, if you got the bread But if all you got is your own two legs Just be glad you got 'emJesus, don't cry You can rely on me honey You can combine anything you want I'll be around You were right about the stars Each one is a setting sun Tall buildings shake Voices escape singing sad sad songs Tuned to chords strung down your cheeks Bitter melodies turning your orbit around Don't cry You can rely on me honey You can come by any time you want I'll be around You were right about the stars Each one is a setting sun Tall buildings shake Voices escape singing sad sad songs Tuned to chords strung down your cheeks Bitter melodies turning your orbit aroundI am an American aquarium drinker I assassin down the avenue I'm hiding out in the big city blinking What was I thinking when I let go of you Let's forget about the tongue-tied lightning Let's undress just like cross-eyed strangers This is not a joke, so please stop smiling What was I thinking when I said it didn't hurt I want to glide through those brown eyes dreaming Take it from the inside, baby hold on tight You were so right when you said I've been drinking What was I thinking when we said good night I want to hold you in the Bible-black predawn You're quite a quiet domino, bury me now Take off your Band-Aid because I don't believe in touchdowns What was I thinking when we said hello I'd always thought that if I held you tightly You'd always love me like you did back then Then I fell asleep and the city kept blinking What was I thinking when I let you back in I’d like to rest my heavy head tonight On a bed of California stars I’d like to lay my weary bones tonight On a bed of California stars I’d love to feel your hand touching mine And tell me why I must keep working on Yes, I’d give my life to lay my head tonight On a bed of California stars I’d like to dream my troubles all away On a bed of California stars Jump up from my starbed, make another day Underneath my California stars They hang like grapes on vines that shine And warm the lovers' glass like friendly wine So I’d give this world just to dream a dream with you On our bed of California stars I’d like to rest my heavy head tonight On a bed of California stars I’d like to lay my weary bones tonight On a bed of California stars I’d love to feel your hand touching mine And tell me why I must keep working on Yes, I’d give my life to lay my head tonight On a bed of California starsThe cash machine is blue and green For a hundred in twenties and a small service fee I could spend three dollars and sixty-three cents On Diet Coca-Cola and unlit cigarettes I wonder why we listen to poets when nobody gives a fuck How hot and sorrowful, this machine begs for luck All my lies are always wishes I know I would die if I could come back new I want a good life with a nose for things Fresh wind and bright sky to enjoy my suffering A hole without a key if I break my tongue Speaking of tomorrow, how will it ever come All my lies are always wishes I know I would die if I could come back new I'm down on my hands and knees every time the doorbell rings I shake like a toothache when I hear myself singThe deal is signed Yes About time Get on the line I did what I had to do That's what they did too Now in Hadestown there were a lot of souls Low, keep your head, keep your head Working on the wall with all their mightCheer up, honey, I hope you can There is something wrong with me My mind is filled with silvery stars Honey, kisses, clouds of fluff Shoulders shrugging off Cheer up, honey, I hope you can There is something wrong with me My mind is filled with radio cures Electronic surgical words Picking apples for the kings and queens Of things I've never seen Oh, distance has no way Of making love understandable Cheer up, honey, I hope you can There is something wrong with me My mind is filled with silvery stars Honey, kisses, clouds of fluff Picking apples for the kings and queens Of things I've never seen Oh, distance has no way Of making love understandableOh, I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands I used to go see on the landing in the summer She fell in love with the drummer She fell in love with the drummer She fell in love Shiny, shiny pants and bleached blond hair A double kick drum by the river in the summer She fell in love with the drummer Another then another She fell in love I miss the innocence I've known Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned Unlock my body and move myself to dance Moving warm liquid, flowing blowing glass Classical music blasting masks the ringing in my ears Oh, I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands I used to go see on the landing in the summer She fell in love with the drummer She fell in love with another She fell in loveImpossible Germany Unlikely Japan Wherever you go Wherever you land I'll say what this means to me I'll do what I can Impossible Germany Unlikely Japan The fundamental problem We all need to face This is important But I know you're not listening Oh, I know you're not listening If this was still new to me I wouldn't understand Impossible Germany Unlikely Japan But this is what love is for To be out of place Gorgeous and alone Face to faceYou and I We might be strangers However close we get sometimes It's like we never met But you and I I think we can take it All the good with the bad Make something that no one else has but You and I You and I Me and you What can we do When the words we use sometimes Are misconstrued Well, I won't guess What's coming next I can't ever tell you The deepest well I've ever fallen into Oh, I don't wanna know Oh, I don't wanna know Oh, I don't need to know Everything about you Oh, I don't wanna know And you don't need to know That much about me
