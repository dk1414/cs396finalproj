Contemplating, isolating And it's stressing me out Different visions, contradictions Why won't you let me out I need a way to separate But I promised you that I'll make sure you never forget me Now that you want it Now that you need it I'm too far gone You're trying to blame me But I'm not breaking I'm telling you, I'm bulletproof Believe me, I'm bulletproof You make me so bulletproof And now I'm too far gone You're addicted and so twisted That it's freaking me out Distant eyes, it's no surprise You can't do anything nowDo we make sense  I think we do In spite of everything that we've been through When you say black and I say white It's not about who's wrong as long as it feels right Don't think those stars won't align Under your scars, I pray You're like a shooting star in the rain You're everything that feels like home to me, yeah Under your scars I could live inside you time after time If you'd only let me live inside of mine Live inside of mine Wish you were here, right beside me So, I could watch you sleep, hold your body closer, breathe you deep And everything feels broken when you're not next to me Would you still be you if we weren't we Under your scars, I pray You're like a shooting star in the rain You're everything that feels like home to me, yeah Under your scars I could live inside you time after time If you'd only let me live inside of mineI'm not the one who's so far away When I feel the snake bite enter my veins Never did I wanna be here again And I don't remember why I came Candles raise my desire Why I'm so far away No more meaning to my life No more reason to stay Freezin' feelin'Breathe in, breathe in I'm comin' back again I'm not the one who's so far away When I feel the snake bite enter my veins Never did I wanna be here again And I don't remember why I came Hazing clouds rain on my head Empty thoughts fill my ears Find my shade by the moonlight Why my thoughts aren't so clear Demons dreamin'Breathe in, breathe in I'm comin' back again I'm not the one who's so far away When I feel the snake bite enter my veins Never did I wanna be here again And I don't remember why I came I'm not the one who's so far away When I feel the snake bite enter my veins Never did I wanna be here again And I don't remember why I came Voodoo Voodoo, voodoo, voodoo I'm not the one who's so far away When I feel the snake bite enter my veins Never did I wanna be here again And I don't remember why I came I'm not the one who's so far away When I feel the snake bite enter my veins Never did I wanna be here again And I don't remember why I cameI've told you this once before, you can't control me If you try to take me down, you're gonna break I feel your every nothing that you're doing for me I'm thinking you ought to make your own way I stand alone, inside I stand alone You're always hiding behind your so-called goddess So, what  You don't think that we can see your face Resurrected back before the final falling I'll never rest until I can make my own way I'm not afraid of fading I stand alone Feeling your sting down inside me, I'm not dying for it I stand alone Everything that I believe is fading I stand alone, inside I stand alone And now, it's my time It's my time to dream Dream of the skies Make me believe that this place isn't plagued by the poison in me Help me decide if my fire will burn out before you can breathe Breathe into meLegs are tired, these hands are broken Alone I try with words unspoken Silent cry, my breath is frozen With blinded eyes, I fear myself It's burning down, it's burning high When ashes fall the legends rise We burned it out a mile wide When ashes fall the legends rise My throat is dry, my vision's fading I'm paralyzed and left here waiting Taking time just one step forward Won't lose my mind, I'm here to stay It's burning down, it's burning high When ashes fall the legends rise We burned it out a mile wide When ashes fall the legends rise Whoa Legends rise Whoa Legends rise Legends rise You gonna do somethin' about it Or just stand there and bleed Wait another minute, can't you see What this pain has fuckin' done to me I'm alive and still kickin', what you see, I can't see And maybe you'll think before you speak I'm alive, for you I'm awake, because of you I'm alive, told you I'm awake, swallowin' you Take another second, turn your back on me And make-believe that you're always happy It's safe to say, you're never alive, a big part of you has died And by the way, I hope you're satisfied I'm alive, for you I'm awake, because of you I'm alive, told you I'm awake, swallowin' you I'm alive, for you I'm awake, because of you I'm alive, told you I'm awakeStrut on by like a king Telling everybody they know nothing And long-lived what you thought you were Time ain't on your side anymore, anymore And so you tell me I can't take my chances But I've told you one too many times And you were cryin' like a bitch I'm tougher than nails, I can promise you that Step outta line and you'll get bitch-slapped back And you can run your little mouth all-day But the hand of God just smacked you back into yesterday And so you tell me I can't take my chances But I've told you one too many times And you were cryin' like a bitch And you wonder why no one can stand you There's no denying you were cryin' like a bitch You were cryin' like a bitchAs I sit here And slowly close my eyes I take another deep breath And feel the wind pass through my body I'm the one in your soul Reflecting inner light Protect the ones who hold you Cradling your inner child I need serenity In a place where I can hide I need serenity Nothing changes, days go by Where do we go when we just don't know And how do we relight the flame when it's cold Why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing And when will we learn to control Tragic visions Slowly stole my life Tore away everything Cheating me out of my time I'm the one who loves you No matter wrong or right And every day I hold you I hold you with my inner childSpoken:"Moonlight is thought to transform some people into strange creatures to drive others mad.""Hola, soy Fernando Allende.""One small step for man...giant leap for man...""Does the moon actually possess such strange powers  Or is it all just lunacy "Let's take a blast to the moon, baby I sit around wishing you well How I'm craving you Yeah Every time I'm near you I always wanna swallow you down I'll be right here if you need me In my life, I'll need you here Don't ask why and I'll never disappear Why is it every day that I feel the pain Ah, yeah Let's take a trip to the stars far away Where were you when I was down Staring into the dead Dead My pain is caused by my pleasure And my soul mate lives in your body I can't get you out of my head It never goes
