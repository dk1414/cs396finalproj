Helplessly hoping Her harlequin hovers nearby Awaiting a word Gasping at glimpses Of gentle true spirit He runs, wishing he could fly Only to trip at the sound of good-bye Wordlessly watching He waits by the window And wonders At the empty place inside Heartlessly helping himself to her bad dreams He worries Did he hear a good-bye  Or even hello They are one person They are two alone They are three together They are for each other Stand by the stairway You'll see something Certain to tell you confusion has its cost Love isn't lying It's loose in a lady who lingers Saying she is lost And choking on helloGot out of town on a boat, going to Southern islands Sailing a reach before a following sea She was making for the trades on the outside And the downhill run to Papeete Off the wind on this heading lie, the Marquesas We got eighty feet of the waterline Nicely making way In a noisy bar in Avalon, I tried to call you But on a midnight watch I realized Why twice you ran away Think about how many times I have fallen Spirits are using me, larger voices calling What heaven brought you and me Cannot be forgotten I have been around the world Looking for that woman-girl Who knows love can endure And you know it willIt's getting to the point where I'm no fun anymore I am sorry Sometimes it hurts so badly, I must cry out loud"I am lonely"I am yours, you are mine You are what you are You make it hard Remember what we've said and done and felt about each other Oh babe, have mercy Don't let the past remind us of what we are not now I am not dreaming I am yours, you are mine You are what you are You make it hard Tearing yourself away from me now--you are free And I am crying This does not mean I don't love you--I do, that's forever Yes and for alwaysIf you smile at me, I will understand'Cause that is something everybody everywhere does In the same language I can see by your coat, my friend You're from the other side There's just one thing I got to know Can you tell me please, who won Say, can I have some of your purple berries Yes, I've been eating them for six or seven weeks now Haven't got sick once Probably keep us both alive Wooden ships on the water, very free and easy Easy, you know the way it's supposed to be Silver people on the shoreline, let us be Talkin' 'bout very free and easyHelplessly hoping Her harlequin hovers nearby Awaiting a word Gasping at
