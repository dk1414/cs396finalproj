You're getting antsy let's go up to Neptune's Net and have a drink And plan a trip somewhere to a beach in a magazineJenny and Jill were sweethearts in the heartland Pure and plain like the voice of Judy Garland Took a year of selling bicycles to buy tickets for the festival That Jenny gave Jill before she moved away And there's a whole lot of people out there who never give loving Jenny and Jill were lucky in love and best friends They talk about things they do and the songs they wanna slow dance to As they drove on through the amber waves of grain And Jenny said: "I don't ever want to forget"How lucky I feel"To be in the same place:"You and I"For everything you do there is a first time And you never forget the first time, the first time Don't forget to be here before you move on'Cause you never forget the first time, the first time They camped out in a field of fellow pilgrims In a tent city of mother nature's children There were hippy kids and brobots, sorority girls on their shoulders There'd be other bands and shows, but never this oneOnce I was a man with a chisel in my hand Breaking up the rocks with the sun burning my neck Then I was the sun throwing down the light of day Thinking I was hot, but a cloud got in my face So I became a cloud casting shadows, dark and gray'Til a gust of wind came and blew my ass away Then I was a wind, but I couldn't blow the rocks Like the chisel and the man who were bustin' in the blocks Rocky mountain road Give myself a look God, I wanna go To my home away from home Rocky mountain road Yellow sun below Lord, I wanna go To my home away from home I can be what I wanna be I can fade by the apple tree I wanna do what I wanna do Wastin' time with someone like you I can be what I wanna be Take me home and set me free I wanna do what I wanna do Remember me as I remember youWhen I arrived in my own set of clothes I was half a world away from my home And I was hunted by the wolves and I was heckled by the crows Darlin' do not fear what you don't really know Alongside my innocence I laid in bed awake Conflicted in these chains with the impetus of age But like a phantom she crept across the floor and out the window Darlin' do not fear what you don't really know From this place on the mantle my heart was taken down Scattered in a thousand little pieces on the ground And out below the streetlamp like an orphan with a halo Darlin' do not fear what you don't really know'Cause it won't last - the worries will pass All your troubles they don't stand a chance And sometimes it takes more than a lifetime to know Darlin' do not fear what you don't really know The confidence is full with your faith etched in stone And I let clean comfort you from the wild unknown So bury your burning hatred like a hatchet in snow Darlin' do not fear what you don't really know If you have a broken heart or a battered soul Find something to hold on to or to let go To help you through the hard nights like a flask filled with hope Darlin' do not fear what you don't really knowYou Know, It's hard to be Yourself Free Yourself, To see Yourself When all around You there are Lies just to get You Spies just to get You, To Buy so they can get You There are Cameras in the sky, Lasers in our Living rooms There are Wolves watching wearing Sheep's Costumes]It's Enough to make You go crazy It's Enough to make You Mad It's Enough to
