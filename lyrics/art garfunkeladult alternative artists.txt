A stick, a stone, it's the end of the road It's the rest of a stump, it's a little alone It's a sliver of glass, it is life, it's the sun It is night, it is death, it's a trap, it's a gun The oak when it blooms, a fox in the brush The nod of the wood, the song of a thrush The wood of the wing, a cliff, a fall A scratch, a lump, it is nothing at all It's the wind blowing free, it's the end of a slope It's a bean, it's a void, it's a hunch, it's a hope And the riverbank talks of the Waters of March It's the end of the strain, it's the joy in your heart The foot, the ground, the flesh and the bone The beat of the road, a sling-shot stone A truckload of bricks in the soft morning light The shot of a gun in the dead of the night A mile, a must, a thrust, a bump It's a girl, it's a rhyme, it's a cold, it's the mumps The plan of the house, the body in bed And the car that got stuck, it's the mud, it's the mud Afloat, adrift, a flight, a wing A cock, a quail, the promise of spring And the riverbank talks of the Waters of March It's the promise of life, it's the joy in your heart A point, a grain, a bee, a bite A blink, a buzzard, a sudden stroke of night A pin, a needle, a sting, a pain A snail, a riddle, a wasp, a stain A snake, a stick, it is John, it is Joe A fish, a flash, a silvery glow And the riverbank talks of the Waters of March It's the promise of life in your heart, in your heart A stick, a stone, the end of the load The rest of a stump, a lonesome road A sliver of glass, a life, the sun A night, a death, the end of the run And the riverbank talks of the Waters of March It's the end of all strain, it's the joy in your heartMy love must be a kind of blind love I can't see anyone but you Are the stars out tonight I don't know if it's cloudy or bright I only have eyes for you, dear The moon may be high But I can't see a thing in the sky'Cause I only have eyes for you I don't know if we're in a garden Or on a crowded avenue You are here, so am I Maybe millions of people go by But they all disappear from view And I only have eyes for you The moon may be high But I can't see a thing in the sky'Cause I only have eyes for you You are here, so am I Maybe millions of people go by But they all disappear from viewI bruise you, you bruise me We both bruise too easily Too easily to let it show I love you, and that's all I know All my plans have fallen through All my plans depend on you Depend on you to help them grow I love you, and that's all I know When the singer's gone Let the song go on...But the ending always comes at last Endings always come too fast They come too fast, but they pass to slow I love you, and that's all I know When the singer's gone Let the song go on It's a fine line between the darkness and the dawn They say the darkest night There's a light beyondI've had time to write a book about The way you act and look But I haven't got a paragraph Words are always getting in my way Anyway, I love you That's all I have to tell you That's All I've Got To SayKeeping my eyes on the road, I see you Keeping my hands on the wheel, I hold you99 Miles From L.A., I kiss you, I miss you, please be there Passing the white sandy beach, we're sailing Turning the radio on, we're dancing99 Miles From L.A., I want you, I need you, please be there The windshield is covered with rain, I'm cryin'Pressing my foot on the gas, I'm flyin'Counting the telephone poles, I phone you Reading the signs on the road, I write you99 Miles From L.A., we're laughing, we're loving, please be there Counting the telephone poles, I phone you Reading the signs on the road, I write you99 Miles From L.A., we're laughing, we're loving, please be thereI watch the distant lights on the runway Disappear into the evening sky Oh, you know I'm with you on your journey Never could say goodbye It's not the sun you're trying to find Something else is on your mind You need a little space and time To break away It's not the place you're going to It's just a phase you're going through Though I won't stop you, I don't want you to Break away Fly across your ocean Break away Time has come for you Break away Fly across your ocean Break away Time has come For you to awaken in another country Greet the morning under foreign skies Leaving me to face another Monday It's not easy to get byFunny how we're all so blind Love is gentle, love is kind in the nighttime Funny we can be so sad It doesn't have to be so bad in the daytime You want to know, where do the songs all go in your lifetime One of these days we'll go and find out where they stay Once upon a lover's song There was a boy who sang along in the nighttime Once upon a lover's dream There was a tale of broken wings in the daytime You want to know, where do the songs all go in your lifetime One of these days we'll go and find out where they stay And I Know, love will come someday And I Know, love will find a way And I Know, love will come some way And I Know, love will change your day The songs that I bring, the songs that I sing yeah Catch a piece of falling star Try to keep it in a jar till the morning Catch a summer firefly Pray that it'll stay alive till the dawning'You want to know, where do the songs all go in your lifetime One of these days we'll go and find out where they stayClearing skies and drying eyes, now I see your smile Darkness goes and softness shows a changing style Just in time, words that rhyme, well bless your soul Now I'll fill your hands with kisses and a Tootsie Roll Reality, it's not for me and it makes me laugh But fantasy world and Disney Girls, I'm coming back Patti Page and summer days on old Cape Cod Happy times and making wine in my garage Country shade and lemonade, guess I'm slowing down It's a turn-back world with a local girl in a smaller town Open cars, and clearer stars, that's what I lack But fantasy world and Disney Girls, I'm coming back Mom, hi, Rick and Dave, hi, Pop, well good morning, Mom!Love, get up  Guess what  I'm in love with a girl I found She's really swell cause she likes church bingo chances and old time dances All my life I spent the nights with dreams of you The warmth I missed for the things I wished are coming true I got my love to give and a place to live, guess I'm gonna stay It'd be a peaceful life with a forever wife and a kid some day It's early nights and pillow fights and your soft laugh But fantasy world and Disney Girls, I'm coming backI don't have plans and schemes And I don't have hopes and dreams I don't have anything Since I don't have you I don't have fond desires And I don't have happy hours I don't have anything Since I don't have you I don't have happiness, and I guess I never will ever again When you walked out on me, in walked Ol' Misery And he's been here since then I don't have love to share And I don't have one who cares I don't have anything Since I don't have you"If they ever drop the bomb," you said"I'll find you in the flames."But now we act like people Who don't know each other's names Well, sometimes it makes me sad, you know Sometimes it makes me smile'Cause you know how the game goes, honey We all eat it once in awhile Scissors cut, paper covers rock Breaks the shining scissor You hurt me I hurt her and she goes and we will miss her Now, I look around at people Playing children's games And I wonder if you're still thinking You might find me somewhere in the flames Scissors cut, paper covers rock Breaks the shining scissor You hurt me I hurt her and she goes and we will miss her
