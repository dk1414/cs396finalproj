Let me hold you for the last time It's the last chance to feel again But you broke me, now I can't feel anything When I love you, it's so untrue I can't even convince myself When I'm speaking it's the voice of someone else Oh, it tears me up I tried to hold on, but it hurts too much I tried to forgive, but it's not enough To make it all okay You can't play on broken strings You can't feel anything That your heart don't want to feel I can't tell you something that ain't real Oh, the truth hurts and lies worse How can I give anymore When I love you a little less than before Oh, what are we doing We are turning into dust Playing house in the ruins of us Running back through the fire When there's nothing left to save It's like chasing the very last train When it's too late, too lateYou only stay with me in the morning You only hold me when I sleep I was meant to tread the water But now I've gotten in too deep For every piece of me that wants you Another piece backs away'Cause you give me something That makes me scared alright This could be nothing But I'm willing to give it a try Please give me something'Cause someday I might know my heart You only waited up for hours Just to spend a little time alone with me And I can say I've never bought you flowers I can't work out what they mean I never thought that I'd love someone That was someone else's dream As you give me something That makes me scared alright This could be nothing But I'm willing to give it a try Please give me something'Cause someday I might call you from my heartWhen it's black Take a little time to hold yourself Take a little time to feel around Before it's gone You won't let go But you still keep on falling down Remember how you saved me now From all of my wrongs, yeah If there's love, just feel it And If there's life, we'll see it This is no time to be alone, alone, yeah I won't let you go Say those words Say those words like there's nothing else Close your eyes and you might believe That there is some way out, yeah Open up Open up your heart to me now Let it all come pouring out There's nothing I can't takeThere's so much craziness surrounding me So much going on, it gets hard to breathe When all my faith has gone, you bring it back to me You make it real for me When I'm not sure of my priorities When I've lost sight of where I'm meant to be Like holy water washing over me You make it real for me And I'm running to you baby You are the only one who saves me That's why I've been missing you lately Cause you make it real for me When my head is strong but my heart is weak I'm full of arrogance and uncertainty When I can't find the words You teach my heart to speak You make it real for me, yeah And I'm running to you baby Cause you are the only one who saves me That's why I've been missing you lately Cause you make it real for meThere was a time I had nothing to give I needed shelter from the storm I was in And when it all got too heavy You carried my weight And I want to hold you And I want to say That you are all that I need For you, I give my soul to keep You see me, love me Just the way I am For you I am a better man I said you are the reason For everything that I do I'd be lost, so lost, without you Under the stars At the edge of the sea There's no one around No one but you and me We'd talk for hours As time drifts away I could stay here for ever And hold you this wayOh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh Tell me why you hold yourself like that, you look so sad But don't tell me that you're giving up when I got your back Still hiding from those people you can't forgive for what they did You can hold it on your own but that's no way to live Don't be scared 'cause there's no doubt I'll lift you up when you're feeling down I'll mend your heart, I'll heal your wounds I'll do what no one else could do I've told you once, I've told you twice I'll tell you this a thousand times Like the burning of the sun Just like the river runs My love goes on Oh, when everything has changed I'll be the one thing that remains My love goes on Oh, when your whole world has shattered I'll be the only one who matters My love goes onI look at you, you bite your tongue You don't know why or where I'm coming from But in my head I'm close to you We're in the rain still searching for the sun You think that I wanna run and hide I'll keep it all locked up inside, I just want you to find me I'm not lost, I'm not lost, just undiscovered And when we're alone we're all the same as each other You see the look that's on my face, you might think that I'm out of place I'm not lost, no no, just undiscovered Well, the time it takes to know someone It all can change before you know it's gone, for it's gone So close your eyes and feel the way I'm with you now believe there's nothing wrong, nothing wrong You think that I wanna run and hide I'll keep it all locked up inside but I just want you to find me I'm not lost, I'm not lost, just undiscovered When we're alone we're all the same as each other You see the look that's on my face, you might think that I'm out of place I'm not lost, no no, just undiscovered I'm not running, oh, I'm not hiding If you dig a little deeper you will find me I'm not lost, not lost, undiscovered When we're alone we're all the same as each other We're always the same You see the look that's on my face, you might think that I'm out of place I'm not lost, no no, undiscovered, sing it, sing it I'm not lost, not lost, undiscovered When we're alone we're all the same as each other You that we're all the same You see the look that's on my face, you might think that I'm out of place Well, I'm not lost, no, just undiscoveredI keep holding onto time Cause it moves so fast Keep believing in a dream Even though I know it won't last Always looking to the stars I follow no man's plan Oooh I do the best I can So if I fall I'll fall with style I won't lie where I land I'll keep on running wild Just like a child I know you said that it's over Our last chance has gone You said you've got to run somewhere I hope it's somewhere you belong And if you never come back To this foolish man Oooh I will understand And if you fall Fall with style Just don't lie where you land Keep on running wild Just like a childThis boy wants to play, there's no time left today It's a shame, 'cause he has to go home This boy's got to work, got to sweat Just to pay what he gets to get left all alone Well, let's step outside Let's go for a ride, just for a while No, we won't get caught Well, that's what I thought, until we cried I'm still here, but it hasn't been easy I'm sure that you had your reasons I'm scared for this emotion For years, I've been holding it down For years, I've been holding it down This girl tries her best everyday But it's all gone to waste, 'cause there's no one around This girl, she can draw, she can paint Likes to dance, she can skate, now she don't make a sound We'll play in our park'Til it's too dark for us to see Well, we'll make our way home With mud on our clothes, she won't be pleasedIt doesn’t even take one minute To tear each other down I tried my best to hurt you, I’ll admit it Just to feel something now When did I get ungrateful for your love When did I stop believing we still could Who’s right or wrong, who gets the blame When you hold me all of that just falls away Can’t we just stay like this, so real, so close Does anything have to change I still trust all the years gone by, inside I know There’s nothing that I’d miss, if we just stay like this Oooooh Now we’re right back at the start, now it’s finished But this time I’ll do ya proud And every step I ever try to take will lead me to your side I’ll love ya loud
