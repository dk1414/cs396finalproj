High school seemed like such a blur I didn't have much interest in sports or school elections And in class I dreamed all day Of a rock 'n' roll weekend And the girl in the front of the room So close yet so far y'know she never seemed to notice That this silly schoolboy crush Wasn't just pretend Life goes by so fast You only want to do what you think is right Close your eyes and then it's past;Story of my life And I went down my old neighborhood The faces have all changed there's no one left to talk to And the pool hall I loved as a kid Is now a 7-11 I went downtown to look for a job I had no training, no experience to speak of I looked at the holes in my jeans And turned and headed backYou say you're down on your luck Hey baby It's a long, long way up Hold back now, hold back your fears You say you're really down and out And you feel like there's no way out now Let go now let go of your tears some more How many times have you asked yourself Is this the hand of fate now that I've been dealt You're so disillusioned this can't be real And you can't stand now the way you feel I don't care about what they say I won't live or die that way Tired of figuring out things on my own Angel's wings won't you carry me home Chorus:And when you're down on your luck Hey baby It's a long, long way up Hold back now, hold back your fears And when you're really down and out And you feel like there's no way out now Let go now, let go of your tears some more Repeat ChorusWell it's been ten years and a thousand tears And look at the mess I'm in A broken nose and a broken heart An empty bottle of gin Well I sit and I pray In my broken down Chevrolet While I'm singing to myself There's got to be another way Take away, take away Take away this ball and chain Well I'm lonely and I'm tired And I can't take any more pain Take away, take away Never to return again Take away, take away Take away this ball and chain Well I've searched and I've searched To find the perfect life A brand new car and a brand new suit I even got me a little wife But wherever I have gone I was sure to find myself there You can run all your life But not go anywhereLove is a burning thing And it makes a fiery ring Bound by one desire I fell into a, a ring of fire I fell into a burnin' ring of fire I went down down down And the flames went higher And it burn burn burns That ring of fire That ring of fire The taste of love is sweet When hearts like ours meet I fell for ya, like a child Oh, let the fire burn wild I fell into a burnin' ring of fire I went down down down And the flames went higher And it burns burn burns That ring of fire That ring of fire Let it burn Well, I'm a gangster in 1934 Junkies, winos, pimps, and whores And all you men, women and kids best get out of the way I just left your town, took all your loot Wore a pink carnation and a pinstripe suit A hopped-up V8 Ford and some two-tone shoes And I'm already gone I left a pool of blood and sorrow I've got the machine gun blues I'll be out of here before the break of dawn I'll hit the highway, smoke a big cigar Gonna stop and bury the cash, then get some more There's only one thing on my mind That's makin' across that old state line Without a hail of avenging bullets waiting there for me And I'm already gone I left a path of pure destruction I've got the machine gun blues Already gone My life will soon be through I've got the machine gun bluesWhen I was young I was invincible I find myself now thinking twice I never thought about no future Its just the roll of the dice But the day may come when you've got something to lose And just when you think you're done paying dues And you say to yourself, dear God what have I done And hope it's not too late cause tomorrow may never come Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come Yesterday is history and tomorrow's a mystery But baby right now, it's just about you and me You can run you can hide, just like Bonnie and Clyde Reach for the sky ain't never gonna die And I thank the Lord for the love I have found And hold you tight cause tomorrow may never come Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never comeMommy's little monster dropped out of school Mommy's little monster broke all the rules He loves to go out drinking with the boys He

Some people like to gamble But you, you always lose Some people like to rock 'n' roll You're always singing the blues You got a nasty disposition No one really knows the reason why You got a bad, bad reputation Gonna hang down your head and cry Y'got bad, bad luck Bad, bad luck Y'got bad, bad luck Bad, bad luck Thirteen's my lucky number To you it means stay inside Black cat done crossed my path No reason to run and hide You're looking through a cracked mirror No one really knows the reason why Your enemies are getting nearer Gonna hang down your head and cry Y'got bad, bad luck Bad, bad luck Y'got bad, bad luck Bad, bad luckWas a moonlight mishap, you lost your party hat Seems your lifestyle ain't so worthwhile after all A heavy-hearted taxi ride and a walk on the wild side Did your guardian angel let you down Gonna lay low and play it straight, it's time to rejuvenate Gonna kick start your heart 'til you come around I can tell you now, you've really gotten the blues I can tell you now that I've walked in your shoes Gimme the sweet and lowdown You better get out the way, it's history made the hard way From a hero to a zero once again Ain't no time for vanity or this insanity You're maladjusted and now you're busted once again I can tell you now, it comes as no surprise I can tell you now by that look in your eyes Gimme the sweet and lowdown You're looking kinda punch drunk, is that the way you strut your stuff With a swing and a swagger, down the road you go You should've made a better choice, listened to your inner voice You gotta get right or get left, don't you know Winners and losers, turn the pages of my life We're beggars and choosers, with all the struggles and the strife I got no reason to turn my head and look the other way We're good and we're evil, which one will I be today There's saints and sinners Life's a gamble and you might lose There's cowards and heroes Both have been known now to break the rules There's lovers and haters The strong and the weak will all have their day We're devils and angels Which one will I be today Chorus:Are you happy now with all the choices you've made Are there times in life when you know you should've stayed Will you compromise and then realize the price is too much to pay Winners and losers, which one will you be today There's a light and a dark side Standing at the crossroads, there we'll meet There's prophets and fools there The lies and the truths, will be at our feet I got a reason to turn my head and look the other way Its heaven and hell here, which one will I live today
