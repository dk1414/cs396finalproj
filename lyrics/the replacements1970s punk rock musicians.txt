Here comes Dick, he's wearing a skirt Here comes Jane, y'know she's sporting a chain Same hair, revolution Same build, evolution Tomorrow who's gonna fuss And they love each other so Androgynous Closer than you know, love each other so Androgynous Don't get him wrong and don't get him mad He might be a father, but he sure ain't a dad And she don't need advice that'll center her She's happy with the way she looks, she's happy with her gender And they love each other so Androgynous Closer than you know, love each other so Androgynous Mirror image, see no damage See no evil at all Kewpie dolls and urine stalls will be laughed at The way you're laughed at nowBring your own lampshade, somewhere, there's a party Here, it's never ending, can't remember when it started Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever If being strong's your kind, I need help here with this feather If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side At the swingin' party, down the line Pound the prairie pavement, losing proposition Quitting school and going to work and never going fishing Water all around, never learn how to swim, now If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever If being strong's your kind, then, I need help here with this feather If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side At the swingin' party, down the line At the swingin' party, down the line Bring your own lampshade, somewhere, there's a party Here, it's never ending, can't remember when it started Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jailOhhh!God, what a mess, on the ladder of success Where you take one step and miss the whole first rung Dreams unfulfilled, graduate unskilled It beats pickin' cotton and waitin' to be forgotten Wait on the sons of no one, bastards of young Wait on the sons of no one, bastards of young The daughters and the sons Clean your baby womb, trash that baby boom Elvis in the ground, no way he'll be here tonight Income tax deduction, one hell of a function It beats pickin' cotton and waitin' to be forgotten Wait on the sons of no one, bastards of young Wait on the sons of no one, bastards of young Now the daughters and the sons Unwillingness to claim us Ya got no warrant to name usIf he was from Venus, would he feed us with a spoon If he was from Mars, then that'd be cool Standing right on campus, would he stamp us in a file Hangin' down in Memphis all the while And children by the million sing for Alex Chilton when he comes 'round They sing, "I'm in love, what's that song Yeah, I'm in love with that song"Cerebral rape and pillage in a village of his choice Invisible man who can sing in a visible voice Feeling like a hundred bucks, exchanging good lucks face to face Check-checkin' his stash by the trash at St  Mark's Place And children by the million sing for Alex Chilton when he comes 'round, 'round They sing, "I'm in love, what's that song Well, I'm in love with that song"I never travel far Without a little Big Star, ooh-oohI'll write you a letter tomorrow Tonight, I can't hold a pen Someone's got a stamp that I can borrow I promise not to blow the address again Lights that flash in the evening Through a crack in the drapes Jesus rides beside me He never buys any smokes Hurry up, hurry up, ain't you had enough of this stuff Ashtray floors, dirty clothes, and filthy jokes See you're high and lonesome Try, try and try Lights that flash in the evening Through a hole in the drapes I'll be home when I'm sleeping I can't hardly wait I can't wait, hardly wait I can't wait, hardly wait I can't wait, hardly wait I can't wait, hardly wait I can't wait, hardly waitOkay Read about your band In some local page Didn't mention your name Didn't mention your name Sweet Georgia breezes Safe, cool and warm I headed up north You headed north On and on and on and on What side are you on On and on and on and on What side are you on Weary voice that's laughin'On the radio once We sounded drunk But you never made it on Passin' through and it's late The station started to fade Picked another one up In the very next stateWell, a person can work up a mean, mean thirst After a hard day of nothin' much at all The summer's passed, it's too late to cut the grass There ain't much to rake anyway in the fall And sometimes I just ain't in the mood To take my place in back with the loudmouths You're like a picture on the fridge that's never stocked with food I used to live at home, now I stay at the house And everybody wants to be special here They call your name out, loud and clear Here comes a regular Call out your name Here comes a regular Am I the only one here today Well, a drinkin' buddy that's bound to another town And once the police made you go away And even if you're in the arms of someone's baby, now I'll take a great big whiskey to you anywayLook me in the eye, then tell me that I'm satisfied Was you satisfied Look me in the eye, then tell me that I'm satisfied Hey, are you satisfied And it goes so slowly on Everything I've ever wanted Tell me what's wrong Look me in the eye and tell me that I'm satisfied Were you satisfied Look me in the eye, then tell me that I'm satisfied Now, are you satisfied Everything goes, well, anything goes All of the time Everything you dream of is right in front of you And everything is a lie Look me in the eye and tell me that I'm satisfed Look me in the eye, unsatisfiedTry and breathe some life into a letter Losing hope, we'll never be together My courage is at its peak You know what I mean How do you say you're okay to an answering machine How do you say good night to an answering machine Big town's got its losers Small town's got its vices A handful of friends:One needs a match, one needs some ice Call-waiting phone in another time zone How do you say I miss you to an answering machine How do say good night to an answering machine I get enough of thatHow young are you  How old am I
