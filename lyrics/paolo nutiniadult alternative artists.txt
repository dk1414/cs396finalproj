We are proud individuals Living for the city But the flames couldn’t go much higher We find Gods and religions To paint us with salvation But no one, no nobody Can give you, the power To rise, over love Over hate Through this iron sky that’s fast becoming our mind Over fear and into freedom Oh, that’s life That’s dripping down the walls Of a dream that cannot breathe In this harsh reality Mass confusion spoon fed to the blind Serves now to define our cold society From which we’ll rise, over love Over hate Through this iron sky that’s fast becoming our mind Over fear and into freedomI was perched outside in the pouring rain Trying to make myself a sail Then I'll float to you, my darlin'With the evening on my tail Although not the most honest means of travel It gets me there nonetheless I'm a heartless man at worst, babe And a helpless one at best Darling, I'll bathe your skin I'll even wash your clothes Just give me some candy before I go Oh darling, I'll kiss your eyes And lay you down on your rug Just give me some candy after my hug Oh, and I'm often false explaining But to her it plays out all the same And although I'm left defeated It gets held against my nameSlow down, lie down Remember it's just you and me Don't sell out, bow out Remember how this used to be I just want you closer Is that alright Baby, let's get closer, tonight Grant my last request and just let me hold you Don't shrug your shoulders Lay down beside me Sure, I can accept that we're going nowhere But one last time let's go there Lay down beside me Oh, an' I've found, that I'm bound To wander down that one-way road Oh, and I realise all about your lies But I'm no wiser than the fool that I was before I just want you closer Is that alright Baby, let's get closer, tonightCross the border, into the big bad world Where it takes you 'bout an hour just to cross the road Just to stumble across another poor old soul From the dreary old lanes to the high-street madness I fight with my brain to believe my eyes And it's harder than you think to delay this sadness That creeps up my spine and haunts me through the night Life is good and the girls are gorgeous Suddenly the air smells much greener now And I'm wondering around with a half pack of cigarettes Searching for the change that I've lost somehow These streets have too many names for me I'm used to Glen Field road and spending my time down in Orchy I'll get used to this eventually I know, I know Where'd the days go when all we did was play And the stress that we were under wasn't stress at all Just a run and a jump into a harmless fall From walking by a high-rise to a landmark square You see millions of people with millions of cares And I struggle to the train to make my way home I look at the people as they sit there aloneHow was I to know you'd just come along Lips like they've been singing sexed up strawberry songs Never heard her coming, thought it's just another woman With a shotgun in her hand She's the bass, she's the beat, she's the rhythm, she's the band And the girl, so fine makes you wanna scream hallelujah Sly hands, spinning webs like silk Beats are dripping on me like spider milk And I never heard the warning when I woke up in the morning With my sunshine on a drip She's my rock, she's my bud, she's tequila, she's a trip And that girl, so fine Makes you wanna scream hallelujah How could I refuse  I'm not fit to choose Said the only way I win is the way I lose And I never got the script, I unzipped Got a little bit wet up in my brain She's your church, she's your sin, she's  atomic, she's the oh she's the rain And the girl, so fine you wanna scream Yeah, yeahI'm always wondering what it would be like to die She asks me, "Why "I always smile when I feel like I'm gonna cry And she asked me, "Why "Over the cliff, and phantom sands She's always offering me her hand And I hear her coming Through the echoes Through the echoes Through the echoes Straight to me Over and over Over and over Over and over again She's always wondering what it would feel like to fly I ask her, "Why "She says evеrything that she sees shine is in the sky Up thеre shining When your belly's rumbling down the phone When you ask for bread and get a stone When you feel like you're alone Listen for me, comingWoke up cold one Tuesday I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick I felt like there was something missing in my day to day life So I quickly opened the wardrobe Pulled out some jeans and a t-shirt that seemed clean Topped it off with a pair of old shoes that were ripped around the seams And I thought these shoes just don't suit me Hey, I put some new shoes on And suddenly everything is right I said, hey, I put some new shoes on And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting Oh, short on money but long on time Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes Woke up late one Thursday And I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes And I felt like there were two days missing as I focused on the time Then I made my way to the kitchen But I had to stop from the shock of what I found The room full of all o' my friends all dancing round and round And I thought: Hello, new shoes, bye-bye bluesYou said you'd marry me if I was 23 But I'm one that you can't see if I'm only 18 Tell me who makes these rules Obviously not you Who are you answering to Oh, Jenny don't be hasty No, don't treat me like a baby Let me take you where you'll let me Because leaving just upsets me Oh, yeah An' I'll be around again to see these other men That are more adequate in the age department I did not think you cared There'd be no problems here But now you're looking at me like you're disgusted and I'm Definitely waiting for you to smile and change your mind Then I'll say "I'm sorry" and I'll wrap my arms 'round your body I really hope that you forgive in a hurry And don't just ask me to leave Oh, Jenny don't be hasty No, don't treat me like a baby Let me take you where you'll let me Because leaving just upsets me Oh, Jenny you are crazy First I'm perfect, then I'm lazy And I was calling you my baby Now it sounds like you've just left me And it kills me, so, wooPicking up the pieces Of the wreck you went and left And I'm dealing with dilemmas In my now so stressful life And I'm drinking stronger spirits I made my home here on the floor And I'm losing all ambition and goals An' I'm going all out An' I'm thinking you're just as bad Not sleeping at night But I'm going from bar to bar Why can't we just rewind Why can't we just rewind Why can't we just rewind Oh, remember at 16 Oh, the crazy drunken night we had When I kissed you in the hallway And then I took you straight to bedI've got a sheet for my bed And a pillow for my head I've got a pencil full of lead And some water for my throat I've got buttons for my coat And sails on my boat So much more than I needed before I got money in the meter And a two bar heater Oh now it's getting hotter Oh it's only getting sweeter I've legs on my chair And a head full of hair Pot and a pan And shoes on my feet I've got a shelf full of books And most of my teeth Two pairs of socks And a door with a lock I've got food in my belly and a license for my telly And nothin's gonna bring me down Oh no, woah And nothin's, no nothin's, nothin's gonna bring me down
