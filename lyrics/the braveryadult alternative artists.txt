The faces all around me, they don't smile, they just crack Waiting for our ship to come, but our ship's not coming back We do our time like pennies in a jar What are we saving for  What are we saving for There's a smell of stale fear that's reeking from our skins The drinking never stops because the drinks absolve our sins We sit and grow our roots into the floor But what are we waiting for  What are we waiting for So give me something to believe'Cause I am living just to breathe And I need something more To keep on breathing for So give me something to believe Something's always coming, you can hear it in the ground It swells into the air with the rising, rising sound And never comes, but shakes the boards and rattles all the doors What are we waiting for  What are we waiting for So give me something to believe'Cause I am living just to breathe And I need something more To keep on breathing for So give me something to believeIf I put my hands around your wrists, would you fight them If I put my fingers in your mouth, would you bite them So many things that I would do if I had my way with you I can keep secrets that I know how you want me You could dig your nails into my skin and you won't stop me You could twist and scream into the air but no one can hear you here And there will be no tenderness, no tenderness There will be no tenderness, no tenderness I will show no mercy for you You had no mercy for me The only thing that I ask, love me mercilessly While your shouting friends that despise you to your face What would they say now if they saw you in this place Naked and breathless, could you live with this disgrace Could you live  Could you live  Could you live with this And there will be no tenderness, no tenderness There will be no tenderness, no tenderness I will show no mercy for you You had no mercy for me The only thing that I ask, love me mercilessly If I put my hands around your wrists, would you fight them If I put my fingers in your mouth, would you bite them So many things that I would do if I had my way with youPeople, they don't mean a thing to you They move right through you, just like your breath But sometimes, I still think of you And I just wanted to, just wanted you to know My old friend I swear I never meant for this I never meant Don't look at me that way It was an honest mistake Don't look at me that way It was an honest mistake, an honest mistake Sometimes, I forget I'm still awake I fuck up and say these things out loud My old friend I swear I never meant for this I never meantSometimes I feel Like I wanna leave this place for good Under the ground I'll live down there without a sound And never hear These hissing voices all the same I'll disappear Cause living makes me feel ashamed I must believe There's more above us and below I must believe Stranded with this bitch called hope It keeps me here When all I wanna do is go It keeps me here When all I wanna do is disappear If this is it When all we have and ever will If this is it Time is running out and standing still I'll leave today Cause there's nothing left to keep me here I'll fade away I'll turn my back and disappear The city moves Lunges up right from the ground The seething Earth It opens up and spits us out This vicious child Nature never wanted us This vicious child A cancer burning black into its heartWhenever I look back On the best days of my life I think I saw them all on T VI am so homesick now For someone that I never knew I am so homesick For some place I will never be Time won't let me go Time won't let me go If I could do it all again I'd go back and change everything but Time won't let me go I never had a "Summer of '69"Never had a Cherry Valence of my own All these precious moments You promised me would come in time So where was I when I missed mine Time won't let me go Time won't let me go If you gave me back those years I'd do it all better I swear Time won't let me goTell me Come on tell me what you can Even as you wait for death You're wiser than I am Tell me What does it mean to exist I am not a scientist I must believe in more than this I cannot accept Everything that's real Is only what our eyes can see And our hands can feel Not even Earth could hold us Not even life controls us Not even the ground can keep us down The memories in my head Are just as real as the time we spent You'll always be close to me my friend This is not the end I see I can see you're so afraid You wear it like a silver hood On you, even fear looks goodI spent my whole life surrounded And I spent my whole life alone I wonder why, I never wonder why the easiest things are so hard I just want, I just want love I just want, I just want love I just want, I just want love I just want Somethin', somethin' for nothin'Oh, somethin', somethin' for nothin''Cause I'm a beggar and a chooser, I'm accused and accuser But nothing's unconditional I hold the whole world accused And I only got myself to blame I wonder why, I never wonder why the easiest things are so hard I just want, I just want love I just want, I just want love I just want, I just want love I just wantI climbed up a mountain, and looked off the edge At all of the lives that I never have led There's one where I stayed with you, across the sea I wonder, do you still think of me I carry your image always in my head Folded and yellowed and torn at the edge And I've look upon it for so many years Slowly I'm losing your face Oh, the ocean rolls us away, away, away The ocean rolls us away Sixes and sevens, we live on jet planes So many faces, I don't know the names So many friends now, and none of them mine Forgotten as soon as we meet All of these moments are lost in time But you're caught in my head like a thorn on a vine To forever torment me, and I wonder why Do I wish I'd never known you at all Oh, the ocean rolls us away, away, away The ocean rolls us away Oh, the ocean rolls us away, away, away The ocean rolls us awayWe are liars like a summer time Like the spring, we are such fools Like fall, we are false prophets And like winter, we are cruel I don't know what's wrong with us They just made us this way There's a hole in you and me That pulls us together And I don't know where we belong I think we grew under a bad sun I know we're not like everyone You and me, we grew under a bad sun Every day you bring me pain And we savor it like rain We hold it on our tongues Just like wine Someday back when we were young I guess something just went wrong The two of us are hung From the same twisted rope And I don't know where we belong I think we grew under a bad sun I know we're not like everyone You and me, we grew under a bad sunThe faces all around me, they don't smile, they just crack Waiting for our ship to come, but our ship's not coming back We do our time like pennies in a jar What are we saving for  What are we saving for There's a smell of stale fear that's reeking from our skins The drinking never stops because the drinks absolve our sins We sit and grow our roots into the floor But what are we waiting for  What are we waiting for So give me something to believe'Cause I am living just to breathe And I need something more To keep on breathing for So give me something to believe Something's always coming, you can hear it in the ground It swells into the air with the rising, rising sound And never comes, but shakes the boards and rattles all the doors What are we waiting for  What are we waiting for So give me something to believe'Cause I am living just to breathe And I need something more To keep on breathing for So give me something to believe
