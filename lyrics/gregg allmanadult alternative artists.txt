Just like a fool'Round and 'round, an' 'round we go Don't ask me why I stay here, I don't know Well, maybe I'm a fool to care Without your sweet love, baby, I would be nowhere So here I'll stay, locked in your web Until that day I might find someone else But I don't know just when that will be, yeah But I don't know, I can't say 'cause I can't seeIt's all gone, for the last time it seems And it's a shame, all the feelings were lost in our scheme The things we had were fine, yeah Did we have to have them all the time Some day we'll find, we should have relied on time All my friends came to see me this year, oh yeah And I was glad to have them here, whoa And maybe we've gone away We can come back any old day If we find how to rely on time, whoa And maybe we've gone away We can come back any old day If we find how to rely on time All my love wrote to me through the years About the way friends can laugh at their fears Oh and it's a lie The better part of you Make it all come true If we find how to rely on time If we find how to rely on timeOnce I was glad Always happy, never sad And every day seemed like Sunday And although things were slow Never seemed to have no dough Somehow, I never once got lonely Ya' see the fact is more or less You're gamblin' with your own happiness And most all your would-be friends Turn out so phony Oh but times they change And re-arrange and I've seen The Queen of Hearts Don't know where to start Or how to stop And as the days have come and gone Left me feelin' that I've done so wrong I've wasted so much time feelin' guilty And as I watch you sit across the room Beautiful as the flower's bloom Leave it lay just one day Oh brother you're gonna come back To find me goneNo, I'm no angel No, I'm no stranger to the streets I've got my label So I won't crumble at your feet And I know, baby So I got scars upon my cheek And I'm not crazy Come on and love me, baby So you found me hard to handle Well, I'm easier to hold So you like my spurs that jingle And never leave you cold So I might steal your diamonds I'll bring you back some gold I'm no angel, mmm No, I'm no angel No, I'm no stranger to the dark Let me rock your cradle Let me start a fire with your spark Oh, come on, baby Come and let me show you my tattoo Let me drive you crazy Come on and love me, babyWell, I've got to run to keep from hiding And I'm bound to keep on riding And
