Juggalo lives are full of complications Are raised to survive on a street education Always realize that there is a limitation If we don't school life with a fresh occupation Without society there's no communication We feel a lot of hate, a lot of frustration But we are driven by the realization That we don't wanna be a sheep in this population So we ascend through the madness without a fall As we climb our way to the gates of Shangri-La Living life can leave your mind in a twirl When you're stuck in the middle of a mad mad world Yo Juggalos It's a mad, mad world out there, ya'll We gotta stick together cause we family You see a fellow juggalo out there about to throw down or fight or something That's you That's your fight Cause we like that, yo We together Unity means strength We can handle anything in this fucked up world Anything at all, ya'll Squall We JuggalosWe got many Psychopathic ninjas on this track Choppin' off wigs like a flyin' guillotine attack Jumpsteady, a shocker, rockin' the blue blockers A Bruce Lee one inch punch heart-stopper You mess with my own, I'll turn you to stone Give ya busy tone from an undertaker's phone That's full circle three fold justice, motherfucker Beat ya silly like a tire-tappin trucker My shit is self explanatory, motherfucker tell a friend Got a Glock that barks louder than a drill team Sargent Never been a bitch, always gots to get respected The target is injected with the venom from my weapon The deadliest disease is when I strike you in the jaw Ain't no time to tell your mama that you love her anymore Ain't no calling on your homies, ain't no calling on the Lord Somebody should have told you about fucking with a corpse It's Violent J y'all and I'm out of control Steady sniping off the California highway patrol Rocking a chemical imbalance in a stolen school bus Full of screaming little kids, we doing ninety plus Running cops off edges, rat a tat tat 'em Busting shots, swervin' and throwing kids at them Jumpsteady in a chopper and away we get Watching everybody else falling over the cliffWe are young Heartache to heartache, we stand No promises, no demands Love is a battlefield We are strong No one can tell us were wrong Searching our hearts for so long Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield Love is a complicated thing sometimes It's like a cereal box toy, hard to find Your heart is a delicate device it's true And a pain in your butt when Cupid's arrow strikes you Then your whole world is turned upside down As you fall for the feelings of your true love found That's all ya think about, it's on your mind24/7, gray matter in a bind Then you seem to live a life, in a magic place But if love becomes lost then begins the heartache Then all the positive energy you feel Turns to sadness as the world loses its appeal But one thing I must say to those who take a fall It's better to have loved once, then not at all So follow your heart and don't ever yield But watch out, cause love is a battlefield"Transmitting brand new Jumpsteady...."Now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep Time swifts back upon my bed As the undead walk inside my head Don't you hear the ghostly calls Transcending from beyond the walls They have shown in this life I've known There's another world beyond our own Twisted, broken, shadow land Connected by paths of emerald sand Have you seen the things I've seen Been visited by phantom beings Haunted by those in hooded cloaks Or been in the séance to invoke Many who see don't believe Because they chose naivety Don't you know that ghosts exist Do you believe in exorcist Don't you know that demons live Do you live a life of sin Don't you know they'll comfort you Depending on the path you choose Don't you hear the ghostly calls Or do you hide behind your walls Samanthy What Whatchu doin I'm doin, um, playin with my friend Samantha Oh, what are you doin -- Samantha Samantha S Oh ok, what are you guys doin We're playin with sidewalk chalk Oh

Would I remain the one and only dragon slayer On the daily, I'm the mastermind of everything you question Skilled like picked forest and the hallowed ground in resting in If the dream glimmer cube really exists Would you wish away the wars and the coming of apocalypse Devastating like the chambers and dungeons combined And slicker than a 20 sided die The ones who are not found divine, must roll for soul The worst is drowning in the moat We're bringing on the anti-dote Underneath the cloak of night Without a dagger in sight It's just the wind and the blades of samurais Waiting for the sun to come up To watch the battle begin The heads has kept his trophies in the warriors den And souls descend and destroy the sick and weary And become elements of the chaos theory...dream of all the
