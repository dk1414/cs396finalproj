The coconut nut is a giant nut If you eat too much, you'll get very fat Now, the coconut nut is a big, big nut But this delicious nut is not a nut It's the coco fruit Of the coco tree From the coco palm family There are so many uses of the coconut tree You can build a big house for the family All you need is to find a coconut man If he cuts the tree, he gets the fruit free It's the coco fruit Of the coco tree From the coco palm family The coconut bark for the kitchen floor If you save some of it, you can build a door Now, the coconut trunk, do not throw this junk If you save some of it, you'll have the second floor The coconut wood is very good It can stand twenty years if you pray it would Now, the coconut root, to tell you the truth You can throw it or use it as firewood The coconut leaves, good shade it gives For the roof, for the walls up against the eaves Now, the coconut fruit, say my relatives Make good cannonballs up against the thievesI hope that our few remaining friends Give up on trying to save us I hope we come up with a fail-safe plot To piss off the dumb few that forgave us I hope the fences we mended Fall down beneath their own weight And I hope we hang on past the last exit I hope it's already too late And I hope the junkyard a few blocks from here Someday burns down And I hope the rising black smoke carries me far away And I never come back to this town again In my life I hope I lie, and tell everyone you were a good wife And I hope you die I hope we both die I hope I cut myself shaving tomorrow I hope it bleeds all day long Our friends say it's darkest before the sun rises We're pretty sure they're all wrong I hope it stays dark forever I hope the worst isn't over And I hope you blink before I do And I hope I never get soberThe coconut nut
