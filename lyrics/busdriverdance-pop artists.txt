I'm just here to hold your hand when you die And to show you around imaginary places Put money lumps in my bloody stump And I will have a smile that's a perfect circle Die in your sleep with the sky at your feet I'll shoot you when you're happy, on the day that you will find peace How do you do  I don't know I'm okay Every person I know is a secret service agent'Cause I'm accused of lewd conduct Stole the heart of a prude prom slut And they got the warrant for my arrest to put me in The loony bin, the funny farm, because of what I did But I'm just here to hold your hand when you die There is not a single person who can do it better No needle skippin in my ecosystem But in the audience may be an evil Christian HM O how I hate him so But they charge me for a halo But I'm on a scavenger hunt for a lavender chunk Of the sky, maybe I'll replace it with a mud-pie I play dead songs on the silk screen Buy my shirt it is a killed dream It is known to lead the way to the stairwell To God's administrative office and a final farewellThis slack-jaw mealy-mouth I mumble when I'm 'round the house I'm trying not to do no chores today Crying in my underwear I lost my sense of wonder there No, I'm not Milan Kundera Though this lightness is unbearable The feeling is indelible I'm wishing I could teleport somewhere Transmolecularize through the secular eye I remember when Vegeta stomped Bardock's neck in Two prayer hands to the heavens, good Lord, bless Him I was a broke slob watching Ghost Dog writing Post Hoc If I could muster just one good throat chop And honor my shidoshi, 'cause 'dim mak' means 'death touch'I been Spock, I been clutch In thin socks, I'm butthurt Impervious pervert with niggerish fervour Crashing Linux server Who didn't even change his laundry over Who needs to buy toilet paper Indie rapper, sorta faker'Cause I couldn't afford a mortgage or a Studebaker'Cause I couldn't afford a mortgage or a Studebaker]Yeah, no, I understand what you're saying, but..  is it sexier than torture )Under the cellulite laden thigh of the night I slip miniature mantras between my cries and gripes Jewel-flavored crystals in the red, blue, and white stripes While crowds throw numbers at me like The Price is Right And downtime is never met with an overjoyed grin Cause sleep and death have always been conjoined twins You'd rather lick the red gills of pop art Than your cement-filled pock marks The withering tendrils from my wrought heart Reach for a Benadryl like it was a lost ark Cause my average day is for the body of aegis, they're prompting these sieges We cry to these seniors, living inside of splotchy Adidas Serving consecutive sentences My corrective lenses is ruby quartz Yet my vision ain't worth a jiggling of booty warts Circumstances trap writers like Kathy Bates Under a decolorized happy face So my car ain't covered in candy paint But still the nanny state can't fix the diaper rash I'm pinging this on a cyber cast Questioning news items playing pattycake with Ira Glass The fact that this pony show's racist Stirs the colloquial cake mix and charges the homeostasis Of all the homies who await us like we some Smokin' Joe Fraziers But my unchecked whining's like some ceremonial plate shiftMe me me me me me me me me me me me me They paint their vulva beige Bleed a cola keg While I plan to ruin G OP motorcades For these senseless zines turned censored scenes I earn a soldier's wage So I broke your legs Threw you rollerblades Because you claimed that the O G was overpaid For pointing M-16s At grenadine Coursing through the pollster aids I need my water brush In the economic crunch The financiers are seeped in embalming slush And the sexist machines Express the means To repeal Roe v Wade So I gotta demode the dark matter On the spring-loaded park plaza Who is in charge I don't know They all eat their business cardsHow could you call yourself the best rapper You in a cover band that’s playing Sledgehammer In your cupped hands is pet hamster Your genitals are sitting on wet pampers Holdup while I test this red snapper Militant like a pledged Panther I hunt big name nigga, I collect antlers And you got bitch problems, breast cancer Hellfyre Club we the wrong set to slander We’ll make you eat a crepe filled with Chia pet dander And I always stay on the set with cameras I go Herzog, nigga you dead like Dirt Dog All you movie-making lames in the booty-shaking vein On the moving gravy train are left in excruciating pain Because I’m in the house, you be like “which house ”I make Witch-House up at your bitch’s house Wearing nothing but a Speedo and a pig snout Y’all must have pricks and ovums Jocking me like I’m Chris Nolan My scathing critique of your shit leaves your script molten Because you want to drive porches through the Waterloos Have a home like the Fortress of Solitude So on-set to snort shit through a hollow tube But at the end you’re just gorgeous piranha foodNow this…this Busdriver name  What exactly are you trying to say  Are you trying to say that you're reaching out to your fellow underclassmen, your fellow proletariat, you're trying to bring them into the light I mean now, when you mean nothing, you don't mean 'nothing'  You mean it in a kind of existential, nihilist, Nietzsche type of way  I mean, tell me what's going on  Explain to me, brother  Explain to me All I wanted was insurance and a dental plan But ladies and gentlemen All they do is grow daisies at a mental can Get a job!Easy for you to say, you're a member in some rap group, but at least I stood for something I'm a baby in a trash hoop who's good for nothing Now, upon buying this album you've done three things:Proven that you're a hippie counterculture sun chaser And proven that you're unaware of your contribution to my fundraiser For me to rule the world, and you want to join the club To get a renewal, you need a referral from a previous employer But we know you're a schoolgirl who needs a devious lawyer To prove otherwise in a court of law  Get this nigga a sport's bra!But that's besides the point You've also proven that mundane tasks to you are like slave labor So you don't do nothing If you were in grave danger Your problem wouldn't prove sudden And went inside to wake up early you at the alarm clock and the snooze button in If you were stranded on a deserted island you would probably farm crops and stew food hunted You inspected all the fun and you laugh, thinking if things go according to plan In the song, you'll be subordinate in a tanning salon Wearing a white shirt, with cold air freezing Drinking soft drinks, yet dying of thirst, but for no apparent reason Well, what are your plans today  Well, I'm certainly not gonna do any of the house chores But I think I'm gonna dabble and do up my dissertation that I'm gonna present to Al Gore With an unpresentable mouth sore About 'nothingness'Hey...
