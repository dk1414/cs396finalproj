So alone And this room feels so cold No one to care and no one to hold Yeah, the Lord knows That I'm needing somebody like you Just like you Can you see the passion burning in my eyes Do you sense the rush you give my heart And if you knew the secret way I feel for you Would you come running to me or would you turn away At night I pray With hope and faith As I lay me down to sleep I pray together we will be And there will come a time You'll be mine All mine And I'll be yours always But until that day comes At night I prayMmmm, ohhh, oooh, oh yes Every time you look at me I forget to breathe Now can't you see How I like how you make me feel When I act this way, you're the one to blame  Oh no You should be careful what you're wishing for You make me lose all my self-control  Don't you know What I need what I needed from you What I want what I want you to do You make me feel this way inside my heart its all your fault What you do when it's already done I want more I can't get enough You

Days and nights and nights and days In silent shades of lazy grays I call your name It's all the same  Sitting, staring at the ceiling Dripping painted pictures peeling From my walls The time just crawls Was it yesterday I don't know, was I dreaming Or did I lose everything I believed in If you could only see what I see Every time you leave Imagine a world with no sky Imagine the ocean run dry Imagine and you'll see the view Of my world without you Imagine no sun and no rain Imagine that each day's the same It doesn't matter what I do In a world without youIn the middle of the rapture - tell me where will you go Baby don't get captured - 'cause then I'll have to follow I will follow you anywhere Oh, where you are I will be there Then you'll follow me In the middle of the ocean - tell me where will you be Once you reach your destination - look around You will find me I will follow you anywhere Oh where you are I will be there, then you'll follow me Just follow me, let your mind be free I will be waiting Just follow me, so patiently Love will be waiting In the middle of the desert - thirstin' for what's out of reach Lift your hands up to the sky - and you'll touch a part of me'Cause you know where you are I will be there Just follow me  Come on  So patiently, love will be waiting Just follow me, let your mind be free I will be waiting Just follow me, so patiently Love will be waiting
