Han sa han ville vært der for meg Hvis eg lovde han for alltid å ha gælter på meg Og folk som før var helter for meg Velter over ende, ut i gaten uten genser på seg Uansett ka du har gjort E uavgjort uansett en seier for en taper som deg Når folk som før var helter for deg Velter over ende ut i gaten uten genser på seg Så blir det dårlig stemning Og kunsten e og holde det ved liv Så jævlig dårlig stemning Skjærer gjennom luften som en kniv Eg ba om å tappe det spare på det Ha det i lommen, ta vare på det Bare i tilfelle graviditet Varige mén, A DH DMaria Mena, vi lar det gå ned Uten å engang forklare no' mer Enn at farene svirrer og svarene e Hengende over der harene e Hoppende høgt over takene te Tullinger som kan tillate seg det Var det så fint, var det så fin E du forsynt eller var det for fint For mangen turer på badet på byn Inn til farer på skader på badet på byn Badabom badabing, det var en kopi Nedi Ladegårdsgaten, de var der på nyMa, all the other options that you had in mind starve me Cause I'm optionless and turkey-free and blind Pa, won't you listen and I'll let you in on this Blind me, won't you listen, I'll reduce advice to dust Oh no, I shouldn't have to spell my name Ma, if it's worth the made up smiles, the quiet fights Oh mother, it is hard not to look in the mirror's eye I have come to this while you have come along So it's alright if you change your mind the other way around again I shouldn't have to spell my name So start the two way monologues that speak your mind We're talking two way monologues with words that rhyme We can't reclaim the shirts we threw away last twirl Uncurl the note-in-pocket, personal brochures that dust Machine-washed, that's how paper rusts Days you spend wanting some of Michael Landon's grace Strike back, now they shape your life as stony as his face Oh no, I shouldn't have to spell his name So start the two way monologues that speak your mind We're talking two way monologues with words that rhyme So start the two way monologues that speak your mind We're talking two way monologuesMy baby surrendered to fate And I couldn’t even say how I felt later on that evening Stating my name to the ofﬁcer’s aide was in vain Cause I knew they were out to get me Place four of ﬁve ﬁngers ﬂat on a sticky plastic bat Scan my blue bloodshot eyes for the history of my trials When crimes are passionate can love be separate When crimes are passionate can love be separate En route to my cell I retraced every step And found a way to redact and retell my story No evidence and no witness to summon or ﬁnesse I confess: it all sounds unlikely A sweaty, paranoid palm pressed against a leathered wall The law in all its ﬂaws, me in an oversized overall When crimes are passionate can love be separate When crimes are passionate can love be separate Baby it’s a bad, bad law It’s a bad, bad law, Geronimo Baby it’s a bad, bad law It’s a bad, bad law, GeronimoFor a self-professed lover, romanticist at heart I wasted less than no time at all Tying the knot Dying to not rot But I'm no sentimentalist Was a self-confessed tyro, so rational so far Such a dumb way to get what you want Loved you a lot, loved you a whole lot But I'm no sentimentalist Don't I know you, my love Don't I know you, my love You can ask me again, but you may never know I'll be damned if I fight I'll be damned if I don't In the end, would it count Don't you know me, my love Don't you know me, my love I may ask you again, but you may never know I'll be damned if I fight I'll be damned if I don't For a final farewell before everything falls down You wasted less than no time at all On a table for eight you set for a trio You were no sentimentalist Sought a mock independence, irrational and harsh Such a sad way to get what you want Love be the hurt and the consoler But I'm no sentimentalistSince the spirit left my soul Love is but an open hole But the body’s come alive Since the spirit left my side I’ve got so much love to give So many graves to dig Soft feelings for you that I struggle with I’ve got so much love to give So many lives to live But blue-eyed love I can’t provide you with Did you see him again Did you call out my name by mistake I’m not myself I just don’t have the force like before I won’t fall, I won’t fight I won’t call, I won’t bite I’m not myself anymore I won’t fight for your love Since the spirit came onboard Love has begged to be explored And the body’s come alive Since the spirit has arrived I’ve got so much love to give So many graves to dig Soft feelings for you that I struggle with I’ve got so much love to give So many lives to live Five words I never thought I’d wrestle withAlready over trying to be alone And brushing up on feeling free Cellphone’s a weapon of surveillance All the distractions I don’t need Your naked body in my dream last night It was like you never left There was a stranger in my bedroom I thought she never would leave I’m always watching I need to see you I’m always watching If I can’t be with you I’m always watching Call it voyeurism or masochism I’m always watching Follow you down digital rabbit holes Who you like, where you’ve been So I continue to pine for the time When you were somewhere with me I wanna follow you into your sleep And gently wake you up Maybe you’re naked on his bed right now Maybe tonight you give him a shotWho do you see when you close your eyes Is that a part of me or part of the disguise Ecstatic moments reduced to this Is it a remedy or is it the abyss We knew the danger we rose above And for a second we were avatars of love We came very close, and yet not very far Could we ever be more than an avatar Avatar of love We picked our poisons, composed ourselves Embodying thе passions wasting on our shelves All that excitеment, long bottled up Our insides poured into a flooded paper cup We fit the moment just like a glove And for an instance became avatars of love We came very close, and yet not very far Frozen in our history as avatars Avatars of love Avatars, avatars of love Release the pigeons, release the doves It doesn't matter what you call it, it's not love We came very close, and yet not very far We're not even fit to be an avatar Avatar, avatar, avatar of loveAlone in the night with only the thought of you The stars that come into view, do I know you by heart When we are apart, how are you so near to me So vivid, so clear to me, like I know you by heart When you want me like I want you We're defenseless to our senses, to our souls But in hindsight, beyond the moonlight At the merciless break of dawn Will we awake and love move on Our bodies fade at the hands of time Like stars eclipsed in the dark All alone in the night All alone in the night Alone in the night, when you're making love to me We know love instinctively, don't you know me by heart When you love me like I love you We're defenseless to our senses, to our souls But in hindsight, in the twilight At the merciless break of dawn Will we awake  Will love be gone Our memories slip through the hands of time Like stars eclipsed in the dark, like you and I All alone in the night All alone in the night All alone in the nightDe som hører på meg, hør:Tjommien min sier eg var annerledes før Men han vet ingenting før han føler som eg gjør Damen min svarer bare med stillhet når eg spør Så sier hun at eg soner for mye ut Eg synes eg soner for mye inn Så går vi inn og ut og ut og inn Av en samtale som fører med seg ingenting2006, eg kan ikkje skjule at Eg e' utilpass, eg går kjapt en kule varmt Og her er det en smule kaldt Mørkt som en gruvesjakt, eg vil bare pule hardt Og eg kan dette livet utenat Utenat det endrer seg, føler meg så utelatt Bli'kkje spilt på radioen, var kanskje den som snuten har Sjåføren fyllekjører, roper ut "snute-faen"Eg ruller ruten ned, ruller ned uten en Plan-B planer å overkjøre de planer du har Western Union sender spenn utenlands Til fjerne land som du ikke finner uten kart Virkeligheten er tilbake igjen Eg ga alt og no har eg bare en plate igjen Elsket, og no har eg bare hatet igjen Ta meg på ordet til det ikke er bokstaver igjen Og rap-Norge irriterer meg Ignorerer meg når eg presenterer meg Ingen imponerer meg, mens noen e sikkert bedre enn meg Det blir til at de lo av meg, om to år eg har roen der Kommer til å virke som om det e' to av meg Som om det e tre av meg, som om det e fler' av meg I mellomtiden så blir notiden så krevende Eg prøvde bare å gjøre drømmen min mer levende Eg slipper stilen fri, mann, eg slipper stilen fri Hvis du tviler, eg bare smiler og gir stilen et liv Eg ga livet lyd Ubeskrivelig, nydelig, motbydeligThought I saw you at the finish line And you were burning a flag And you were biding your time Thought I saw you at the finish line And you were burning a flag And you were biding your time And you were biding your time And you were biding your time And you Tripped on my compass as I fled on foot Shed all my luggage, all your fuck-me-boots Cute as a button on a wounded high horse Sink into the quicksand of desire and remorse Pissed off and juiced up, with my back to the wall Blindfolded, eager to give into the fall Stripped of the structures that boggled my mind Sink into the quicksand, making up for lost time Serenading in the trenches Do you wanna pretend we’re dead Serenading in the trenches Do you wanna make love instead Cute-ass casualties, clueless come-ons Our aborted mission, our self-indulgence
