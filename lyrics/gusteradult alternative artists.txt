Shining like a work of art Hanging on a wall of stars Are you what I think you are You're my satellite You're riding with me tonight Passenger side, lighting the sky Always the first star that I find You're my satellite Elevator to the moon Whistling our favorite tune Tryin' to get a closer view You're my satellite You're riding with me tonight Passenger side, lighting the sky Always the first star that I find You're my satelliteI built a time machine I'm going to see the homecoming queen Take her to the Christmas dance Maybe now I'll get in her pants, whatever Back with my high school friends Meeting where the train tracks end Passing round a skinny joint Rolling up to lookout point I want to pull it apart and put it back together I want to relive all my adolescent dreams Inspired by true events on movie screens I am a one man wrecking machine Back in my parents house Back to the shouting out loud One day you'll be a man One day you'll understandI’m halfway home, at the pub on the corner of the street I see kids from school, but I stare down at my feet Sports on T VThey scream for victory A few blocks down, there’s Dawn, she’s got spinach on her teeth In between the front ones, just a little bitty leaf And I try to speak, but Dawn makes me nervous And I get overexcited Can’t do a damn thing about it My God we’re shoulder to shoulder Nice guy looking for a future lover The pet shop’s closed, too bad, cause animals like me back We had a dog once, we all just called her Kat Was mum’s idea She’s got great sense of humor Later tonight, some soup, then I’ll probably send a text“Hey Dawn it’s Jim, would you like to have some sex And if that’s too weird, maybe just a hot chocolate”Enter a scene that defies description They say to open your mind and take it all inside One click at a time We move through fictions And send our sisters to the sacrifice A cruel conviction Sinister systems keep us satisfied These are hard times I’m breathing in the oxygen I’m holding it through hard times I’m breathing out in the ultrasound Things come around in hard times10,000 miles of the new prescriptions So we open our mouths and take 'em all inside One pill at a time The purist fictions We send our sisters to the sacrifice With cruel conviction Sinister systems keep us satisfied These are hard timesSay goodbye, lose your friends Make them go, don't need them around'Cause it's time, lose your friends Make them go, was never supposed to be like this They were too weak Too prone to break Their needs too deep Their skin too thin By now you took what was to take Tear it apart and start again So go on If this will make you happier It got you this far Do what you have to You've wasted every moment Of your Saturdays and your Sundays You're wasted from the boredom It was never supposed to be like this Like your father said"Just do what was done onto you, always"In your father's steps You'll do what was done onto you It won't be hard to start againWas in the way you put your coffee down There was something on your chest The days keep dragging on and on I got a bag of old regrets You said the whole shebang The crumbly bits Aw, babe, I want much more than this Okay, será, será, será, será Don’t go, don’t go Don’t go making something out of nothing Don’t go What do you think it would change In a dream you saw a memory Held a sign that said confess Nostalgia, she’s a shit disease It’s a shame to reminisce I want hippie love Future sex5am French cigarettes Okay, okay Okay, será, seráWe were young, twenty-one All those years ago In came the fascination Everything was out of control A life, untried From thickets and from thorns Out came a revelation Everything was out of control Do you feel it Do you feel it now Cause we want it But we don't know how Do we have it As much as anybody ever has I want to wake you from your dream I want to know just who you're talking to When you're singing in your sleep I want to find out what it means Do you love me Now we're fine, alight But all those days are gone We read our constellations Everything is under control Are you tired  I'm tired The T V sparks and glows The newsman gives information Everything is under controlTonight Where do we go from here The road to Ruby Falls has reached the end And now We're digging in the sand They're promising that help is on the way Love Confession number one Impossible and sorry And judge, can you look the other way Some things are best unsaid And now Where can we go from here When all the morning birds have gone away Two wrongs Won't navigate tonight The afterlife is all in the end The afterlife is ours in the end Love Don't look me in the eye Just wash it all down And judge Can you let me know the way We're out of here Straight out of hereDorothy moves To click her ruby shoes Right in tune With Dark Side of the Moon Someone, someone could tell me Where I belong Be calm, be brave It'll be okay No more messing around And living underground Or New Year's resolutions By this time next year I won't be here I turn on, turn on M TV The volume's down Lips move, they say It'll be okay To tell you the truth, I've said it before Tomorrow I start in a new direction One last time these words from me I'm never saying them again And I shut the light and listen as my watch unwindsThe sun came up, the world began to shake Fault lines exposing all my old mistakes If I could do anything Then this wouldn't be happening It’s been a long time Since I’ve felt courageous Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up Walking in my sleep never to awaken Be love, be love, be love, be love Look alive Should watch what I say There’s power in my refrains Most of these days Been pumping on the brakes If we could do anything Then this wouldn't be happening If we’re strong for once It could get contagious Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up Walking in my sleep never to awaken Be love, be love, be love, be love Look alive Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up Dancing in the dark with old hallucinations Be love, be love, be love, be love Look alive
