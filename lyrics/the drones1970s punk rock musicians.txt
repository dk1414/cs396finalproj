Thud, thud, my heart pumps blood Whenever someone talks about my Taman Shud Who ditched that fox-gloved snitch And loaded him with poison like a puffer fish Why don't anybody feel like crying For the Somerton somebody with the hazel eyes Why don't anybody feel like crying For the Somerton nobody with the hazel eyes Thud, thud, my heart pumping blood Whenever someone talks about my Taman Shud He's gone and no one even cares at all The earth won't answer and the sea don't mourn I don't give a fuck about no Anzackery I don't care you got it interest free I ain't gonna fret about "Lest we forget"Fuck the Murdoch press, I'm saying I don't get hung up on any carbon tax Or Ned getting strung up for being a psychopath I ain't really there with any class warfare The only thing I care about's theYeah, standing on the deck, I watch my shadow stretch The sun pours my shadow upon that deck The water's lickin' 'round my ankles now There ain't no sunshine way, way down I see the sharks are in the water like slicks of ink Well, there's one there bigger than a submarine As he circles, I look in his eye I see Jonah in his belly by the campfire light Oh, an albatross up in the windy lofts Yeah, he's beating his wings while he sleeps it off I hear the jettisoned cries from his dreams unkind Yeah, they're whipping my ears like a riding crop Well, the captain once as able as a fink dandy He's now laid up in the galley like a dried-out mink He's laying dying of thirst and he says, or I think"Well, we're gonna be alone from here on in"Yeah, you're all my brothers and you have been kind But what were you expecting to find Now your eyes turn inward, countenance turn blank And I'm floating away on a barrel of pain It looks like nothing but the sea and sky would remainI can hear a Jericho Trumpet But the sky's perfectly clear Whether it’s real or recollection It’s like I'm stranded on a pier Watching waves of emigration Being rewound off the beach While the long road to unconsciousness Ebbs out at my heels Now I'm walking the halls of Charles de Gaulle With a fresh-minted boarding pass I got a date with Ben-Gurion Standing in a subway I'm feeling like I've overstayed I'm waiting with my sack for the Amtrak And a ticket out of J FK I didn't do anything I didn’t do nothing I didn’t say a thing Still not a wordHere, the sun's giving way and the last of its shade's Grown as long as the ache that you gave me Yeah, you said nothing's perfect, though you came pretty close But then time's made the most of you lately Only now you feel more like you're up for the cause Like you've had second thoughts And your heart's lost its thrust, you're marooned on the moon And you need livening up But why come back for me  I ain't no great beauty Well, I guess you've got time on your hands It ain't no big deal, me being lost at sea'Til you start losing blood on the sand To think I To think that I once loved you To think I To think that I once loved you I know that corridor where your nerves pave the floor And the walls waterfall all around you You're all made out of glue, just a residue And I've taken your place and I'm feeling brand new Yeah, right, nothing here's perfect, I am totally sold I've been dragged 'cross the coals a lot lately I don't wanna ruin your fun but you got your refund And now I'm paid to make rain where you burnt meThe best songs are like bad dreams If you can cover all the exits But one by one they blur And you’re forgetting all the words By the time you get to breakfast A reckoning election A politician's corkscrew A credit card mini bar private rental car And a Western education12 square feet of dirty day The whole world made to order I’m either taking up more space Than I have taken up before Or the days are getting shorter Now I’m smoking in a blindfold In an Indonesian courtyard I always thought ‘bout quitting But then there’s the reptilian And his business is to die hard But now I’m feeling kinda free I’m going straight to D VD I’m losing my ambition Going into remission I've put it all behind meThe 'burbs are growing like a fingernail Slower than the dullest pain I want the hunger and cold of the nights of old When there was blood up to the Himalayas I’m saying farewell to the welfare state The only comfort is a caliphate I'm guessing war sure beats any old North Shore beach Or any Western Suburbs single player I'm looking for the type of test A cataclysm make me beat my chest Man, any kind of 'ism' beats a singing competition On a T V fat with gnash and wail They got me singing in a different scale Don't wanna push no pram or join a bikie gang Or flip a burger for the infidel Yeah, no one ever lives to tell What’s at the bottom of an oil well Boredom, boredom I’m gonna take a pic down there Put my index finger in the air Boredom, boredom Gonna tag it with my username And you can flag it for its guts and brainsStrontium-90 Removed from milk Is as curious an entity As bullshit writ on silk Cancer's airborne now Do you hear the sound I was hanging out the washing, man As the rain came falling down Now the grass lies snakes Has crowds of iodine and fire On Jezebel's luminescence I swear you are my heart's desire Bombproof the embassy Give infanticide a cemetery You looked so good on the late night news With your curtain and your deed Yeah, I love you like a violin I'll hunt you like an amputee But I ain't gonna lose my skin I would love to see you again Again.. We don't write letters anymore There ain't the time or place But a friend of mine wrote something Like a letter yesterday It was smuggled through my inbox Just this morning, 3:00am More impotent than important Let me read it now, verbatim He says, "I got that same old feeling The one that turns the birds to brutes The sky is like a bad dream And the earth is in cahoots I don't believe no one no more I don't care what no one says I just want to make the world A much less painful place And we look fonder on the good old days As they drift further away But why, if everyone feels so homesick Are they always settin' sail 'Cause it's all bad news up there on deck And each headland masks the next I'd just as soon dive in the ocean And forgo the blood and sweat And forgo all aspirations They just put everyone at odds If idle hands are the Devil's work Then where's the time for God's "I see seaweed on the lawn There's no point coming here no more Do you remember way back when When weeks sank in the swimming pool Holidays were cotton wool Your bald tyre friends, the pelicans, cowboys and indians Admit it, she was kinda cute Her panties were your parachute They found her near the airport, in a crater, near the bend Where she and I'd walk by the zoo Not knowing we'd do what all plagues do I forget her all the time these days and be forgotten too We're lockstepping in our billions Lockstepping in our swarms Lockstepping in the certainty that more need to be born I was fine but not the whole time, see I fiddled while Rome stewed, and lord It choked my heart, but spades are spades My head's here now to tell you We're lockstepping in our billions Lockstepping in our swarms Lockstepping in the certainty that more need to be bornOne Sunday morning While I was out walking By the Brisbane's waters I chanced to stray There I found a prisoner Layed half in the water He'd seen me coming And he began to say"I was a native of Erin's Ireland And before I was brought To this terrible place They dragged me away From my wife and newborn And my ailing parents I've been a prisoner at Port Macquarie Norfolk Island and Emu Plains At Castle Hill and cursed Toongabbie At all of these settlements I've worked in chains But of all the places of condemnation At each penal station of New South Wales To Moreton Bay I've found no equal The tyranny there makes all the rest pale There I met O'Brien The defender from Ulster He'd left Ireland burning Came here for the wake He was a schemer A Jacobite nightmare He could not be broken But he became displaced The Jew had one hand He was a violent man He'd worn the 20 pound irons Since before time began Just before the dawn broke His starvation awoke He'd pick the corn from the filth He'd find laying around There ain't no walls at all So remote is the North The Commandant Logan Was the devil for sure His chief flogger was mad I heard a prison guard say He'd wash his lash in a bucket Then drinks the remains
