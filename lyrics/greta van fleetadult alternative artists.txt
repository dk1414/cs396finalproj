I didn't know there was a tower Where they look out to the land To see the people quickly passing by This is for their own desire As they spit down to the earth To feel the power boiling in their veins Woah oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah Woah oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah!And the black smoke rises From the fires, we've been told It's the new age crisis And we will stand up in the cold Stand up in the cold Many people are dividing And a world apart with just one heart Is bound to keel and fade away None of us will be deciding And the fate of man is in the hands Of he who stands and heeds the callOh,

maiden's fair Now she rides through the night On a silver storm Sword in hand Our fate's torn She's a sparrow of the dawn Our love is bornEvery day's a new day Every way's a new way On the edge of darkness, finding out what it means to love And to think we've found the time All my brothers we stand for the peace of the land Is there meaning I've got love in my heart for an army apart I am bleeding All my brothers we stand for the peace of the land Is there meaning I've got love in my heart for an army apart I am bleeding Always searching for love Always searching for light What the

bleeding All my brothers we stand for the peace of the land Is there meaning I've got love in my heart for an army apart I am bleedingWell, you're so pretty and I love you so You know I'm your biggest fan I saw your picture and it's the best The finest in the land Camera, lights, and action Yeah, the words you know so well You're in and out of fashion In Hollywood of Hell When the curtain falls Walk the hollow halls, babe Once a valley doll Now you're not at all, no Well, I love you in that movie show Can I have your autograph It's so funny you have such charm The whole thing made me laughSorrows of the Earth May our tears of rain wash down to bathe you This is what life is worth When the fires still burn and rage all around Can you hear that dreadful sound Fire still burning on the ground Follow the fearsome sound As they march to battle, hear the drums pound We do not fight for war But to save the lives of those who do so Can you hear that dreadful sound Fire still burning on the ground Can you feel my love Rising with the heat above Life's the story of Ascending to the stars as oneIn an age of darkness light appears And it wards away the ancient fears March to the anthem of the heart To a brand new day, a brand new start To wonderlands of ice and snow In the desert heat where nothing grows A tree of life in rain and sun To reach the sky it's just begun And as we came into the clear To find ourselves where we are here Who is the wiser to help us steer And will we know when the end is near A beauty lives in every soul The more you love the more you know They pass the torch and it still burns Once children then it's now our turn And as we came into the clear To find ourselves where we are here Who is the wiser to help us steer And will we know when the end is near Oh mama you lie in ruin Can't you see what you've done Well I've been there before What's this war that you won Oh mama you walk this way And I'm crying inside Well I've been there before And you know that it's time And everybody's talking But you never let them know Yes I can hear them talking Everyone knows That's there's talking on the streets Remember the days When there's no one to defeat Follow me down To the mountain of the sun Forgetting the end As your new life has begun Look mama the light is low And the darkness near Yes everyone is looking for me and you And the night's what you fear Look, someone, they follow us And they're all undone Yes everyone is looking for me and you And the war has begunWith the news, there's something every day So many people thinking different ways, you say Where is the music A tune to free the soul A simple lyric, to unite us all, you know Your opinion only knows the one thing That you seem to want to have most And you chose To save yourself in your own time you'll have to Stay and open up your own mind And every glow in the twilight knows That the world is only what the world is made of Just you and me can agree to disagree That the world is only what the world is made of In all the noise facing every day The colored world has turned into a grey, you say And from the void, the place in which we came Can we step back and see we want the same Oh Lord
