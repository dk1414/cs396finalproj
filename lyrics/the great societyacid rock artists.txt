I love you girl And when I go Don't let no one say That it isn't so But something's calling out to me That I don't understand But can't refuse And though I set my world on fire And spread its ashes wide, you made your mark The sounds I love to hear are being made So it appears across the way And now the bells are ringing loud To call me up To do what I must do And trying to replace myself I likely won't have time to think of you I guess I'll never know what could have been If had stayed here by your side But still I've got to go and find out What it is that's hurtin me insideThere was a boy A very strange enchanted boy They say he wandered very far, very far Over land and sea A little shy and sad of eye But very wise was he And then one day A magic day he came my way And while we spoke of many things Fools and kings This he said to me"The greatest thing you'll ever learn Is just to love and be loved in return"There was a boy A very strange enchanted boy They say he wandered very far, very far Over land and sea A little shy and sad of eye But very wise was he And then one day A magic day he came my way And while we spoke of many things Fools and kings This he said to meDarkly smiling There are no tickets And you may pay As you leave The man in black goes lurching through And he doesn't even think of you Strain to feel the movement And hear the music And see the night The man in black goes lurching through And he doesn't even think of you What does it matter how far The vacuum is leaving the jarWhen the truth is found to be lies And all the joy within you dies Don't you want somebody to love Don't you need somebody to love Wouldn't you love somebody to love You better find somebody to love Tears are running down your dress And your friends, they treat you like a guest Don't you want somebody to love Don't you need somebody to love Wouldn't you love somebody to love You better find somebody to love Don't you want somebody to love Don't you need somebody to love Wouldn't you love somebody to love You better find somebody to love When the garden flowers are dead And your mind is full of red Don't you want somebody to love Don't you need somebody to love Wouldn't you love somebody to love Well, you better find somebody to loveOne pill makes you larger And one pill makes you small And the ones that mother gives you Don't do anything at all Go ask Alice When she's ten feet tall And if you go chasing rabbits And you know you're going to fall Tell him a hooka-smoking caterpillar Has given you the call And call Alice When she was just small When the men on the chessboard get up tell you where to go And you've just had some kind of mushroom And your mind is moving slow Go ask Alice I think she'll know When logic and proportion have fallen sloppy dead And the white knight is talking backwards And the red queen is off with her head Remember what the doormouse said Feed your head Feed your headA lonely preacher and he lives at the Swiss Hotel One night in the middle of a sermon, oh, out the window he fell Oh, oh, Lenny, we're so glad you're getting well well well You see the hardheaded people all dress up in a big black robe They say his word offend them, you know they're hiding their heads in the hole The words are killing dirty, I use it in the last line But use a short word for loving, and dad, you wind up doing time Father Bruce is up and walking Look out, he's gonna start talking Oh, oh, Lenny, we're so glad you're getting well, well, well Now won't you get your feet out, Catholic Father Bruce is back in town You know he's our kind of preacher Ain't none of us gonna put him down He's trying to say something to you, listen while you're still around Who's gonna carry all the workload when you're ten feet under ground Father Bruce is up and walking Look out, he's gonna start talking Oh, oh, Lenny, we're so glad you're getting well, well, well Now you may say he's got a bad mouth, but I heard you just the other night When you're car wouldn't start, boy, the words you said were out of sight Well, you're a loco Charlie, wouldn't say that word out in a crowd But Lenny's right up front, baby, speaking his mind right out loudI looked out my window The cloud was grimly forming Waiting for the rain I saw The one dark cloud forming The soldiers paid no heed I could hear their hollow laughter Down the hill in pairs and threes The Red Cross girls came after Gypsies, drunken roaring With their reddened sabres flying In its tangled jungle mess Her vat was softly crying The beggars came through fine But there was nobody by I looked out my window The cloud was grimly forming Waiting for the rain I saw The dark clouds forming The soldiers paid no heed I could hear their hollow laughter And waiting for the rain I saw the gypsies marching afterNever thought that it could be the one face that I'd love Never thought that I could place that one above the other But his way of turning on seemed right to me And I think that he'll make me free Things that he chooses to put into his mind Seem to have place his sadness behind him And if I have to follow it will change the way he is And with me his sovereignty can be lost by what I give And if he mentions leaving I can do no more To make him stay behind an open door The love that he loses he will find again another way And I won't be the one to tell him where he must play When I first met him he was glaring at me And I think it was black that he was wearing at the time But he spoke of changes and said come with me And I was glad to leave I have heard so many things I never thought I'd feel before And I won't be through with him until says like a ravenSally, go 'round the roses Sally, go 'round the roses And know the roses they can hurt you And know the roses they can hurt you Sally, don't you go, don't you go downtown Sally, don't you go, don't you go downtown'Cause saddest thing in the whole wide world Is to see your lady with another girl Sally, go 'round the roses Sally, go 'round the roses And know the roses they can hurt you And know the roses they can hurt you Sally, don't you go, oh no, don't you go downtown Sally, don't you go, don't you go downtown Because saddest thing in the whole wide world See your lady with another girl, oh hoI love you girl And when I go Don't let no one say That it isn't so But something's calling out to me That I don't understand But can't refuse And though I set my world on fire And spread its ashes wide, you made your mark The sounds I love to hear are being made So it appears across the way And now the bells are ringing loud To call me up To do what I must do And trying to replace myself I likely won't have time to think of you I guess I'll never know what could have been If had stayed here by your side But still I've got to go and find out What it is that's hurtin me inside
