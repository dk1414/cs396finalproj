I was saying "let me out of here" before I was even born It's such a gamble when you get a face It's fascinating to observe what the mirror does, but When I dine, it's for the wall that I set a place I belong to the Blank Generation, and I can take it or leave it each time, well I belong to the ..  generation, but I can take it or leave it each time Triangles were falling out the window as the doctor cursed He was a cartoon, long forsaken by the public eye The nurse adjusted her garters as I breathed my first The doctor grabbed my throat and yelled, "God's consolation prize!"I belong to the Blank Generation, and I can take it or leave it each time, well I belong to the ..  generation, but I can take it or leave it each time, take it Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, oohTime and time again, I knew what I was doing And time and time again, I just made things worse It seems you see the most of what is really true When you're stepping into your hearse Only time can write a song that's really, really real The most a man can do is say the way its playing feels And know he only knows as much as time to him reveals And when I wanna write a song that says it all at once Like time sublimely silences the whys I know that if I try, I'm gonna take a fall at once And splatter there between my lies Only time can write a song that's really, really real The most a man can do is say the way its playing feels And know he only knows as much as time to him reveals We are made of it, and if we give submission Among our chances there's a chance we can choose And if we take it by uncertainty's permission, then Then it's impossible to loseI was a child Who wanted love that was wild Though tight as slow motion But crazed with devotion Insane with devotion A whole other notion I was fourteen and a half And it wasn't no laugh Love comes in spurts - oh no it hurts Love comes in spurts - it hurts Love comes in spurts - oh no, cause Love comes in spurts - it always hurts I just can't get wise To those tragical lies Though I now know the facts They still cut like an axe Cause love comes in spurts In dangerous flirts And it murders your heart They didn't tell you that part Love comes in spurts Love comes in spurts Love comes in spurts Love comes in spurtsBetrayal takes two  Who did it to who I mean: not to be cut by your dull point of view Feelings will change - we're helpless they must We like it that way - eliminates trust But that cut on your arm where the blood is still fresh And the thought of some harm that comes to yourself...Hey sweetheart cool off, you're not so distraught...You lost what you had but that's what I've got I'll close my eyes while you take off my clothes No wait a while till this feelings goes...The feeling gets stronger, two times emptiness-We'll embrace that much longer, make more of a mess...The senstation of life was aroused in ourself From the plot we digressed, knocked the books off the shelves Then burned down the house, then met in a bar With a motel attached and kissed all the scars We're changed now for good, but I try to insert My face to appear when you love when you flirt.. I withdrew from the street and all humanlike zones I'd had it, I'd had it - I was mush to the bones I covered the windows, I was taking no calls Then I thought for a month inside the alien walls Now I know oh They don't tell you so Now I know, oh They don't tell you so Now I know  Oh They don't tell you so But I can recall it all I called up a girl I'd known for so many years I'd seen her in shock, I'd seen the last of her tears I admired her style from her toes to her brain -She accepted my plan and so she caught the next train Now I know oh They don't tell you so Now I know, oh They don't tell you so Now I know  Oh They don't tell you so But I can recall it allWell, too young to drink and too smart to think Attaches on his head with the missing link He's skinny as a snake and fast as a mink But he ain't for sale unless you add the kitchen sink Well look out, here he comes again They say he's dead, he's my three best friends He's so honest that the dishonest dread Meeting the kid with the replaceable head Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum When you live on a planet the size of a town You can't get your kicks by getting around Yeah, fun's hard to find on such familiar ground So you invent it: the mental, it's better than found Well look out, here he comes again They say he's dead, he's my three best friends He's so honest that the dishonest dread Meeting the kid with the replaceable headOh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Look out liars and you highlife scum Who gotta keep your victims poor and dumb Your motives and your methods are not disguised By your silk, soap, sex, or your smiling lies Your lies Your lies Look out here You pompous jerk Look out here I'll go berserk Well I guess you put me in my place But I won't forget your stupid face They gave you power cause they knew your needs Soprano boys get talent when you shoot your seeds Your seeds Your seeds Well you laugh to hear what your best friends say Old man they laugh when you walk away Away AwayHead wrapped in your hair In a box lined with silk You can't learn to talk And the air is your milk Erasing my face I want you so bad I want to be you It's futile it's sad Oh, oh baby Oh, oh baby Oh, oh baby Oh oh oh I could live with you in another world I could live with you in another world I could live with you in another world Muscle against silk Tears fall from the burn A smell of perfume In a moment you'll turn In a moment you'll turn Your face will change shape We exchange just one gift:To see like an apeLate last night, I went for a walk Down by the river near my home Couldn't believe with my own eyes And I swear I'll never leave my home again I saw a man walking on the water Coming right at me from the other side Calling out my name, "Do not be afraid"Feet begin to run, pounding in my brain I don't wanna go I don't wanna go No, no, no, no, no I don't wanna goI used to lie in my room and just stare Frustrated eyes flipping pages of air And gaze after gaze, I could see nothing there I was just a flaw in the scheme Of everything but nightmarish dreams No one could stand feeling that way for long So I, I chose to regard all the world as the wrong And to, and to make my own long assertions in song I decided I just didn't care That I'd look, and I could see nothing there But now But now, but now, but now I lie there staring in her eyes I lie there staring in her eyes I watch her be The sight I wanted so much to see Oh, let me tell you about a pleasure I've found First you surrender and stop looking around And then you get the one who you wanna lie down
