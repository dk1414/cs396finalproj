gigolo on the street With his hands in his pockets and his crocodile feet Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed And the boys from home, they all came running They were making noise, manhandling toys There's the girls on the block with the nasty curls Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours Gigolo Huh, sucka Gigolo  Gigolo Huh,

the sword and the stone, bad to the bone Battle's not over, even when it's won And when a child is born, into this world It has no concept of the tone of skin it's living in It's not a second—we're seven seconds away Or just as long as I stay; I'll be waiting It's not a second—we're seven seconds away Or just as long as I stay; I'll be waiting I'll be waiting...I'll be waiting J'assume les raisons qui nous poussent de changer tout J'aimerais qu'on oublie leurs couleurs pour qu'ils espèrent Beaucoup de sentiments de races qui font qu'ils désespèrent Je veux les deux mains ouvertes Des amis pour parler de leurs peines, et de leur joie Pour qu'ils leur aient des infos qui ne divisent pas—Changez O K, you're on your own, it's late Your girlfriend is on another date With the hero in your dream Turn around, ask yourself So you think you're gonna win this time, manchild Is it the pain of the drinking or the Sunday sinking feeling The car never seems to work When it's late your girlfriend's on a date And the hero with her in your dream in your sleep seemed like you Turn around, ask yourself Turn around, ask yourself Manchild, will you ever win Manchild, look at the state you're in Could you go undercover and sell your brand new lover  be someone else for a night Maybe someone else will love you You'd sell your soul for a tacky song like the ones you hear on the radio Turn around, ask yourself Turn around and ask yourself Manchild, will you ever win Manchild, look at the state you're in Manchild, he will make you cry Manchild, manchild, manchildSpreading faster than an eye can blink So I had to sit down and take time to think Of how to spread the word to people all across the land To make sure they putting out a helping hand Neneh Cherry know the story, so it must be told About a group of people left in the cold Caught by a plague slowly they fade From an immune deficiency, you see, called "A ID S"No knowledge of the facts, kept in the dark Scolds my soul and it hurts my heart The young and elderly just running blind Hurts so bad they denied their own kind Papa turned around and said, "That ain't mine"It just made it worse for life on the line And it's a shame to see a little child mature Growing up knowing that there ain't no cure I've got you under my skin, uh I've got you under my skin Pure pain you're givin' me I've got you deep in the heart of me Down so deep, you're really a part of me I've got you, got you, got you under my skinPero chica, mi amiga, ¿que dice Esto es yo, esto es yo y como hablo Y hablo así y hablo así contigo Do, do-do-do, do-do, do, do Nah, man Nah, man, you know Ay, pero man No soy tu amiga, tú sabes Yo soy tu amiga¿Qué  ¿Pero qué dices chica Ay, me voy Down this wild street walks Walks a child with no trace Of ever being as young as her sister is A local neighborhood crush The boys would hide out and watch Her hanging washing on the line all the timeLove forsaken, risk worth taking Spearmint flavours, all my pallet shutters I’m a member of shattered allusions And am I needless to say Another song, this is nothing new But love is big and every land Every nation seeks its friends in France and Italy And all across the seven seas And Goddamn guns and guts and history And bitter love still put a hole in me Bite my head off, still my world will always be A little risk worth taking Bite my hand off, still my world will always be Another risk worth taking Gotta step out a limb, swallow my pride Surrender and not give myself away Little measures all the time Become part of you nothing new Still

fall Driving me crazy, I need it all On my 28th day he is my victim He is my saviour, he breaks my fall The things that we say, all stacked in one pile Stay fresh a good while, our prodigal Too many times you come crawling, say sorry, too late Papercut regrets will not stick, better change Too many times you come crawling, say sorry, too late Papercut regrets will not stick, better change Need to be right, right to be wrong Sometimes a loser, lost down the hall Leave me alone but don’t leave me lonely And please don't look now, can you see this Does my ass look big in these new trousers My ego won't let me, I forget I feel so small, I hate you, I hate you I love you, I love you, I love it all I love it, I love it allVerse 1 : Michael Stipe & Neneh Cherry You can find some time to be someone
