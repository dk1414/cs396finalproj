It's not like I'm feeling much different Than a woman my age years ago Liberated is what you wanna call it How about unfairly choked Cause I know some just see my body And every girl I know at some point stopped eating I'm not a man hater I enjoy them like cake But in my position I'm the slut I'm the bitch I'm the whore The one you hate And there’s a name for this kind of man A soft one at that Womanizer Casanova Lothario For us it’s just a stamp to the head For them another notch in the bed It’s like I’m wearing red, and if I am You feel you’ve the right to touch me Cause I asked for it In my little mini skirt Think you can have it My little mini skirt It’s mine all mine I know what it’s like To have everything Taken away from me and my family For there was once a man Proposing to love all of us Instead he is full of hate Towards himself, towards his bait And everything he touches is for him My mother’s soul he devours with a grin And when she finds out The child he has taken Confronts him Stakes him Breaks him All our boxes on the lawn Woman shelter for 9 months Cross the street to the church Pray confusedly about what hurts Enough to start A new beginning for us both I thank you Canada Thank you CanadaTake me by the hand Will you guide me through this phase Of not really knowing where I am Or knowing who I am I could think of it as I gave all my best in loving you But I know it’s not true It’s just my way of getting through We experience the love that we think we deserve And I guess I thought I didn’t need much from this world So I left you But you’re exactly what I like I will give you my whole life Mmmm you taste so nice Oh this feels so right Take me by the throat Will you push me up against this wall And spit all your hurt on me So I can feel my reach I have these dreams Of you laying it on meMake believe that I can see you with myself Do the kind of things I want from no one else And there's you, and there's me And we both go together, easily There's you, and there's me And we both go together, easily Pick up, you can start over No need to wait 'til the next morning comes Felt like I messed up already Watch some porn and surfed'Til my eyes got sore again And now I'm feeling gross and choked Like everything I don't wanna be a part of The girls with balloons, and the men with batons Shoving it hard, two people being porn stars Being porn stars Make believe that I am in touch with myself Do the kind of things I watch from someone elseThe days assemble, what do I see A river running inside of me Some have waded and many more will We laid on the bank and had our fill Still my mind lingers there on that day When we rolled around and you touched me your way The years assemble, what do I see A cloud of memories above me Of friends, and lovers, some turned enemies I forgive them all, I hope they'll forgive me Still my mind lingers there on that day Where she stormed my room, and she slapped you her way The hardest part is letting go The hardest part is letting go The hardest part is letting go The hardest part is letting goSpent our time In an apartment Growing exhausted A beheaded sun king Who hadn't come out since The first white fell Upon the balcony Where before we would melt Flock of three Pigeons hatching I considered cracking Their eggs from our house Instead we watched them grow Fed them in a row Sweet avoidance For what we already know That we feel like giving up Why's there so much trouble Go and lay under another Feels warm like summer I knocked my tooth out on a swing So high and not realizing The come down it would bring My eyes go running like a fountainIt's not like I'm feeling much different Than a woman my age years ago Liberated is what you wanna call it How about unfairly choked Cause I know
