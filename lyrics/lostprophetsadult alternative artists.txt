One, two, three!To every broken heart in here Love was once a part, but now it's disappeared She told me that it's all part of the choices that you make Even when you think you're right, you have to give to take But there's still tomorrow Forget the sorrow And I can be on the last train home Watch it pass the day As it fades away No more time to care No more time today But we sing If we're going nowhere Yeah, we sing If it's not enough And we sing Sing without a reason to ever fall in loveWhen our time is up When our lives are done Will we say we've had our fun Will we make our mark this time Will we always say we tried Standing on the rooftops Everybody scream your heart out Standing on the rooftops Everybody scream your heart out Standing on the rooftops Everybody scream your heart out This is all we got now Everybody scream your heart out All the love I've met I have no regrets If it all ends now, I'm set Will we make our mark this time Will we always say we tried Got it all too high Got it figured out Wanna do whatever Laugh until September And I seem to think that you were once here with me Maybe I was wrong You were moving on And I sit and wonder, falling under Get my way or nothing will move on Everyone has gone You feel so empty but I've got me a friend And I like it And I know you say I can't care for someone But are you that clever that you smile forever Is it summer yet cause I just don't feel it Maybe it's a treaty, maybe you are not her And I sit and wonder, falling under Get my way or nothing will move on Everyone has goneWe've had lots of fun at Town

one Though he has all of his toys He is never having fun Because it's not enough Now we're growing up We are giving up We are moving on Because its not enough We were growing up We are giving up And I won't hear what you say so Save your sympathy Who do you think you're fooling Everything is dead!Now you welcome me To a town called hypocrisy Save your sympathy Who do you think you're fooling Everything is dead!Now you welcome me To a town called hypocrisyWith you it's never good enough Because you want the stuff that could change your future You're lost amongst a sea of chance And now the more you dance just gets you sinkin' deeper It's okay, don't apologize You don't know what you're striving for and you never seem to try It's too early, go live your lie Keep on moving, it's time to Ride, ride, ride, now it's time to Ride, ride, ride Everything seems tempting but nothing comes for free I often wonder how you drive when the road's too dark to see It's too early, it's time to We light the fire to watch it burn But when it comes your turn all that's left is embers You ran this race with no real heart, you're right back at the start You'd already lost it It's okay, don't apologize You don't know what you're striving for and you never seem to try It's too early, go live your lie Keep on moving, it's time toYesterday I lost my closest friend Yesterday I wanted time to end I wonder if my heart will ever mend I just let you slip away4 A M forever Maybe I'll never see you smile again Maybe you thought that it was all pretend;All these words that I could never say I just let them slip away4 A M forever Why don't you hear me when I'm calling out to you Why don't you listen when I try to make it through Goodbye, goodbye Goodbye, you never know Hold a little tighter4 A M forever Maybe one day when I can move along Maybe someday when you can hear this song You won't let it slip awaySomebody told me that I'd always have to bow If that was true I would have fallen apart by now The more you think, the less you act their way So can you hear this, the fake sound of progress Never reason with a fool, but is that unkind Looks like I've lost my mind once again I know it all sounds so contrived, but it's got to me You know I've got to be more than this Don't frown, don't scorn, cause I walk a different street to you You look so worn, I bet that life has got you blown But it will never get to me Somebody told me that I'd always have to bow If that was true I would have fallen apart by now The more you think, the less you act their ways So can you hear this, the fake sound of progress And I feel the way you hold, hold me back from this Chances that I've missed, now they're gone Apathy is all I sense, the feeling's too intense Sitting on the fence and can't decide Don't frown, don't scorn, cause I walk a different street to you You look so worn, I bet that life is has got you blown No body will ever get to meThe Friday sun bears down again As we drive with our friends And on these longest days we spend All the time trying to pretend That our stories could be true Wanting to be cool The settin' sunset's day is through If only we knew And we all sit 'round here in our home town Listen to the waves as they all crash down And watch the fire as it slowly burns away Glowin' embers fly across the sky you're Here by my side, in my summer, our last summer The world passes by in my summer, our last summer The light makes shadows fall, surrounded by each other I let you watch it all, the view from our last summer The view from our last summer We trace the sun across the sky And we laugh 'til we cry Always so hard to say goodbye And we all sit 'round here in our home town It's so good like this, these are times we'll miss The memories, I hope will never fade Glowin' embers fly across the sky you'reEnd to it all Falling down Losing touch with everyone who ever stood their ground If you could then I know I do too Lost inside a maze of problems with you Chorus:Is it so hard Every time I say Won't you come and fight with me Because if I thought I'd win you Every word I'd say Would come out wrong And make me look the other way You know if I thought I'd win you, time and time again And if I did we won't be friends And tell me I'm brought down again Never the one I explain Can't you warn Don't you lie There've been times when I've felt good because you're hurt inside No that's not true I'm just acting tough I don't know what it is I'm feeling I don't know if you are enoughBite that lip Cause your tongue is a gun and your brain is the trigger Fire at will Oh I doubt that mouth could get any bigger You live in hypocrisy, those skies are always sunny You're never gonna be a threat to anybody You're lying, you're lying You're gonna be the one left crying If you bring a gun, baby, we'll bring an arsenal If you think we're done, baby, we'll bring it, we'll sing it Open your eyes and see you are outnumbered, honey You're never gonna be a threat to anybody You'll never get this dance tonight So split, oh you can run till you're done but the shame will never leave ya Had your fun, was it worth all the time getting people to believe ya Open your eyes and see it never was that funny You're never gonna be a threat to anybody You're lying, you're lying You're gonna be the one left crying If you bring a gun, baby, we'll bring an arsenal If you think we're done, baby, we'll bring it, we'll sing it Open your eyes and see you are outnumbered, honey You're never gonna be a threat to anybody
