Nibblin' on sponge cake, watchin' the sun bake All of those tourists covered with oil Strummin' my six-string on my front porch swing Smell those shrimp, they're beginnin' to boil Wastin’ away again in Margaritaville Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt Some people claim that there's a woman to blame But I know it's nobody's fault Don't know the reason I stayed here all season Nothin' to show but this brand new tattoo But it's a real beauty, a Mexican cutie How it got here I haven't a clue Wastin’ away again in Margaritaville Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt Some people claim that there's a woman to blame Now I think, hell, it could be my fault I blew out my flip-flop, stepped on a pop top Cut my heel, had to cruise on back home But there’s booze in the blender and soon it will render That frozen concoction that helps me hang onTried to amend my carnivorous habits Made it nearly seventy days Losin' weight without speed, eatin' sunflower seeds Drinkin' lots of carrot juice and soakin' up rays But at night I'd have these wonderful dreams Some kind of sensuous treat Not zucchini, fettuccini, or bulgur wheat But a big warm bun and a huge hunk of meat Cheeseburger in paradise Heaven on earth with an onion slice Not too particular, not too precise I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise Heard about the old-time sailor men They eat the same thing again and again Warm beer and bread, they say, could raise the dead Well, it reminds me of the menu at a Holiday Inn But times have changed for sailors these days When I'm in port, I get what I need Not just Havanas or bananas or daiquiris But that American creation on which I feedI took off for a weekend last month Just to try and recall the whole year All of the faces and all of the places Wonderin' where they all disappeared I didn't ponder the question too long;I was hungry and went out for a bite Ran into a chum with a bottle of rum And we wound up drinkin' all night It's those changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes Nothing remains quite the same With all of our running and all of our cunning If we couldn't laugh, we would all go insane Reading departure signs in some big airport Reminds me of the places I've been Visions of good times that brought so much pleasure Makes me want to go back againI really do appreciate the fact you're sittin' here Your voice sounds so wonderful But your face don't look too clear So, Barmaid, bring a pitcher, another round of brew Honey, why don't we get drunk and screw Why don't we get drunk and screw I just bought a waterbed filled up for me and you They say you are a snuff queen, Honey, I don't think that's true So, why don't we get drunk and screw Why don't we get drunk and screw I just bought a waterbed filled up for me and you They say you are a snuff queen, Honey, I don't think that's true So, why don't we get drunk and screwMother, mother ocean, I have heard you call Wanted to sail upon your waters since I was three feet tall You've seen it all, you've seen it all Watched the men who rode you switch from sails to steam And in your belly, you hold the treasures few have ever seen Most of 'em dream, most of 'em dream Yes I am a pirate, two hundred years too late The cannons don't thunder, there's nothin' to plunder I'm an over-forty victim of fate Arriving too late, arriving too late I've done a bit of smugglin', I've run my share of grass I made enough money to buy Miami, but I pissed it away so fast Never meant to last, never meant to last And I have been drunk now for over two weeks I passed out and I rallied and I sprung a few leaks But I got to stop wishin', got to go fishin'Down to rock bottom again Just a few friends, just a few friendsYou know I was talking to my friend Desdemona the other day She runs this space station and bake shop down near Boomtown She told me that human beings are flawed individuals That the cosmic bakers took us out of the oven a little too early And that's the reason we're as crazy as we are, and I believe it!Take for example, when you go to the movies these days You know, they try to sell you this jumbo drink8 extra ounces of watered-down Cherry Coke For an extra 25 cents  I don't want it I don't want that much organization in my life I don't want other people thinking for me I want my Junior Mints Where did the Junior Mints go in the movies I don't want a 12 lb  Nestle's crunch for 25 dollars I W AN T J UN IO R M IN TS!We need more fruitcakes in this world and less bakers!We need people that care!I'm mad as hell and I don't want to take it anymore!Fruitcakes in the kitchen, fruitcakes on the street Struttin' naked through the crosswalk in the middle of the week Half-baked cookies in the oven, half-baked people on the bus There's a little bit of fruitcake left in everyone of usShe came down from Cincinnati It took her three days on a train Looking for some peace and quiet Hoped to see the sun again But now she lives down by the ocean She's taking care to look for sharks They hang out in the local bars And they feed right after dark Can't you feel them circling, honey Can't you feel them swimming around You got fins to the left, fins to the right And you're the only bait in town Oh-oh-woah, oh-oh-woah You got fins to the left, fins to the right And you're the only girl in town She's saving up all of her money Wants to hit it south in May Maybe roll in the sand with a rock 'n roll man Somewhere down Montserrat Way But the money's good, and the season Helps to lighten up her load Boys keep her high as the months go by She's getting post cards from the roadBoat drinks, boys in the band ordered boat drinks Visitors scored on the home rink Everything seems to be wrong Lately, newspaper mentioned cheap air fare I gotta to fly to Saint Somewhere I'm close to bodily harm Twenty degrees and the hockey game's on Nobody cares, they are way too far gone Screamin' "boat drinks"Something to keep 'em all warm This morning I shot six holes in my freezer I think I got cabin fever Somebody sound the alarm I'd like to go where the pace of life's slow Could you beam me somewhere, Mr  Scott Any old place here on earth or in space You pick the century and I'll pick the spotNow I don't know, I don't know I don't know where I'm a-gonna go when the volcano blows Let me say now I don't know, I don't know I don't know where I'm a-gonna go when the volcano blows Ground she's moving under me Tidal waves out on the sea Sulphur smoke up in the sky Pretty soon we learn to fly Let me hear you now, I don't know, I don't know I don't know where I'm a-gonna go when the volcano blows Now my girl quickly said to me Man you better watch your feet Lava come down soft and hot You better love-a me now or love-a me not Let me say now, I don't know, I don't know I don't know where I'm a-gonna go when the volcano blows Mr  Utley As the son of a son of a sailor I went out on the sea for adventure Expanding the view of the captain and crew Like a man just released from indenture As a dreamer of dreams and a travelin' man I have chalked up many a mile Read dozens of books about heroes and crooks And I learned much from both of their styles Son of a son, son of a son Son of a son of a sailor Son of a gun, load the last ton One step ahead of the jailer Now away in the near future Southeast of disorder You can shake the hand of the mango man As he greets you at the border And the lady, she hails from Trinidad Island of the spices Salt for your meat and cinnamon sweet And the rum is for all your good vices
