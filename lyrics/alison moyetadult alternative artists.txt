When I am laid, am laid in earth, may my wrongs create No trouble, no trouble in, in thy breast When I am laid, am laid in earth, may my wrongs create No trouble, no trouble in, in thy breast Remember me, remember me, but ah!Forget my fate Remember me, but ah!Forget my fate Remember me, remember me, but ah!Forget my fate Remember me, but ah!Forget my fateLooking from a window above It's like a story of love Can you hear me Came back only yesterday I'm moving farther away Want you near me All I needed was the love you gave All I needed for another day And all I ever knew Only you Sometimes when I think of her name When it's only a game And I need you Listen to the words that you say It's getting harder to stay When I see you All I needed was the love you gave All I needed for another day And all I ever knew Only you All I needed was the love you gave All I needed for another day And all I ever knew Only youYou've got me so confused And there's words I could use But I'm afraid to say them I feel I've been had and I'm boiling mad Still I can't live without you You don't have the time And you won't spend a dime Not even to call me Oh, you don't know I exist And I wouldn't be missed If I had the nerve to quit you Invisible I feel like I'm invisible You treat me like I'm not really there And you don't really care I know this romance It ain't going nowhere Invisible You treat me like I'm invisible When you get the need to flirt You do the works You just don't care how much it hurtsIf you can't find me here Mirror catch my breath Deep in the thick of still All the thirsty beasts come down to drink Water buffers your skin Stone forbids me to come in I taste a ballet in this storm Even as the paper falls It dances And we're big cats pacing fences Wild cats counting inches Hungry seeing hungry Feed on Reassuring Pinches Play something that will sing Wear a porch-face frown Let sun colour us in When just the hand remembers now Water buffers our skin So truly we are untouching Paper leaps its ballet in a storm Whichever way we fall We're dancingOh, its a long time since I saw you Well you know how time can fly It seems like yesterday we were lovers Now we pass each other by But if we're left alone tonight, don't ask me to hold you tight I go weak I go weak I go weak I go weak, weak in the presence of beauty All my friends, keep asking Why I'm quiet while you're around They dont know I think I'm so lucky to stop myself from falling down So later if you're on your own Don't ask me to take you home I go weak I go weak I go weak I go weak, weak in the presence of beauty Cause if were left alone tonight I'll have no choice but to hold you tight I go weak I go weak I go weak I go weak, weak in the presence of beautyIf you don't come back to me You'll have saved me goodbyes My escape would be neat I won't lose a minute's sleep Recovering what we made and meant not to keep Life is Sweet Can it fail to astound me How it surrounds me And I won't steal to breathe If you never came back to me If you don't come back to me I won't measure by you every man that I see When next by chance we meet I'll pass you by and not care if you're watching me Life is Sweet How it spins me around Something's lost, something's found And I won't hit the ground If you never came back to me Can it fail to astound me How it surrounds me And I won't steal to breathe If you never came back to meIt's that ole devil called love again Gets behind me and keeps giving me that shove again Putting rain in my eyes, tears in my dreams And rocks in my heart It's that sly old sun of a gun again He keeps telling me that I'm the lucky one again But I still have that rain, still have those tears And those rocks in my heart Suppose I didn't stay, ran away, wouldn't play The devil, what a potion he would brew He'd follow me around, build me up, tear me down'Till I'd be so bewildered, I wouldn't know what to do Might as well give up that fight again I know darn well he'll convince me that he's right again When he sings that sorry song I'm just gonna tag along With that ole devil called love He'd follow me around, build me up, tear me down With that ole devil called loveLove letters straight from your heart Keep us so near while apart I'm not alone in the night When I can have all the love that you write I memorize every line And I kiss the name that you sign And darling then I read again Right from the start Love letters straight from your heart I memorize every line And I kiss the name that you sign And darling then I read again Right from the start Love letters straight from your heartRound, like a circle in a spiral Like a wheel within a wheel Never ending or beginning On an ever spinning wheel Like a snowball down a mountain Or a carnival balloon Like a carousell that's turning Running rings around the moon Like a clock whose hands are sweeping Past the minutes on its face And the world is like an apple Whirling silently in space Like the circles that you find In the windmills of your mind Like a tunnel that you follow To a tunnel of its own Down a hollow to a cavern Where the sun has never shone Like a door that keeps revolving In a half forgotten dream Or the ripples from a pebble Someone tosses in a stream Like a clock whose hands are sweeping Past the minutes on its face And the world is like an apple Whirling silently in space Like the circles that you find In the windmills of your mindWhen she said that you were through I thought that there was nothing that I could do Just because she ran right here Doesn't mean I interfered Now I'm wondering if we can feel the same Cause she keeps whispering your name She keeps on whispering your name Like she's just waiting She once told me how she felt Didn't just want me to hear it from someone else There were unknowns she couldn't know But she hoped you two would grow And when you didn't she was brought to me in pain And she keeps whispering your name She keeps on whispering your name Like she's just waiting If it's just a little fling a simple thing I'll try not to pretend If it's just for jealousy she's using me That might be hard to mend
