Now there's somethin' I'd like to talk to you about at this particular moment And that's about the one thing that we won't be able to do together Unless we all become as one And if we all become as one and then we can walk through it together Now I ain't walked through it all the way yet But there was a time I walked into it, and I had to go into it alone That's this place called the Halls of Karma Now when you go into the Halls of Karma the way I did, I don't know, it might have been hallucination But I think it was real See, I felt the presence of the two energies The positive and the negative Of God and the Devil However you want it And they was pullin' and decidin' and wondering what to do with my soul And I couldn't take this at this moment 'cause I had to come back to be with you people To do a thing and I proved to 'em In bargainin' with 'em that I had a thing to do for the good of all of us Out of this bargain, the devil, he got my body For the good in his needs while I'm here on earth And the Lord, he's got my mind for the good of the universe And for the good of man And they both, they got me in between 'cause they both got my soul So the next time I come up I want the Lord to please have mercy on my soulIt's my Jim Dandy!Go, Jim Dandy  Go, Jim Dandy  Okay, yeah I was sitting on a mountain top30,000 feet to drop I fled on a runaway horse Uh-huh, that's

that's sad I gazed thru the window But things didn't look like before For the things I used to see I know I'll see them no more Some things may seem So unimportant and small But to the ones who love them most Like the trees they are tall For it was better that I first saw The things I most wanted in life And to see them again Would alleviate all strife Now woman if you want me Then I'll want you
