The dawn is breaking A light shining through You're barely waking And I'm tangled up in you, yeah Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo But I'm open, you're closed Where I follow, you'll go I worry I won't see your face Light up again Even the best fall down sometimes Even the wrong words seem to rhyme Out of the doubt that fills my mind I somehow find you and I collide Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-dooSweet is the side Of her room Window open by candle light How would you know Cold Winter on the shore Chills a dress she wore It's on the floor It feels so warm today And that's why I'm wondering Why you had to tell me What's goin' on in your head What's wrong Come around to another time When you don't have to run And when she says she wants somebody else I hope you know That she doesn't mean you And when she breaks down and makes a sound You'll never hear her The way that i do And when she says she wants someone to love I hope you know She doesn't mean you And when she breaks down and lets you down I hope you know That she doesn't mean to Yeah, yeah, I know itIs it dark where you are Can you count the stars where you are Do you feel like you are a thousand miles from home Are you lost where you are Can you find your way when you're so far Do you fear where you are A thousand nights alone So here we are, set into motion We'll steal a car and crash in the ocean You and I, caught in a fading light On the longest night It's enough just to find love It's the only thing to be sure of So hard to let go of A thousand times or more I was close to a fault line Heaven knows you showed up in time Was it real Now I feel like I'm never coming down So here we are, set into motion Steal a car, crash in the ocean You and I, caught in a fading light On the longest nightThe dawn is breaking A light shinin' through You're barely wakin'But I'm tangled up in you, yeah But I'm open, you're closed Where I follow, you'll go I worry I won't see your face Light up again Even the best fall down sometimes And even the wrong words seem to rhyme And out of the doubt that fills your mind I somehow find you and I collide But I'm quiet, you know You make a first impression Well, I've found I'm scared to know I'm always on your mind Well, even the best fall down sometimes And even the stars refuse to shine And out of the back you fall in time I somehow find you and I'd collideIt's not that bad We could have died Chalk it up to being young Prove it was me On a morning drive A blurred headlight From the corner of my eye If only you were here right now You'd tell me Wouldn't it be something If everything changed Wouldn't it be something in your way Wouldn't be more than Living in your wake If you and I would ever cease to be You summer dress A late downpour And how it caught us on the stairs That silent song you sing to me Keeps sayin'Wouldn't it be something If everything changed Wouldn't it be something in your way Wouldn't it be more than Living in your wake If you and I would ever cease to beHere, where they can't find us I dare them to call me out Or tell you We met here on purpose I bet they can't wait to wake us up It's all a little bit strange I know it's a little bit strange Make a point and ignore them Come on, let's wait this out They'll find out We never stop turning And sometimes it's tough To change direction I know it's a little bit strange It's all a little bit strange At the end of a day I'm gonna say what I mean It's slipping all away, away At the end of our days We'll escape We'll escapeSo you think you can hold the world up by a string With all that you have And I would hold every part of you that I could hold And I'm on And I'm on again Brace yourself With all that you have Enough I'm in love again Brace yourself now So you feel anything and everything could be All that you wanted Stay with me I'm in no condition to be alone And I'm on And I'm on again Brace yourself With all that you have Enough I'm in love again Brace yourself nowIt's the perfect time of day It's the last day of your life Don't let it drift away While your heart is still racing It's the perfect time of day And you won't feel a thing And you won't recall anything at all Close your eyes And take your last breath Rest your head inside The end is the beginning And every point in-between Some are lost, oh, some are lost And you won't feel a thing And you won't recall anything at all Let your colors collide All the time is so fleeting I quit running behind Oh, I know your meaning You look too far For what you wanna say And you look for The perfect time of dayI need somebody Not just anybody, help You know I need someone When I was younger, so much younger than today I never needed anybody's help in any way And now these days are gone I'm not so self-assured Now I'm fine, I changed my mind I've opened up the doors Help me if you can, I'm feeling down And I do appreciate you being 'round Help me get my feet back on the ground Won't you please, please help me And now my life has changed in oh so many ways My independence seems to vanish in the haze But every now and then, I feel so insecure I know that I just need you like I've never done before Help me if you can, I'm feeling down And I do appreciate you being 'round Help me get my feet back on the ground Won't you please, please help me Help meMake me fall down Make me get up And if I'm alright Make sure I'm scared to death Maybe I'm useless If I just could remember Make me feel nervous and I'll Make you surrender I'll take you on Yeah, I'll take you on I'll give it all away But you don't But you don't I'll give it all away But you don't Feel much better You said it yourself You said I'm not ready I'm tellin' myself But it's not sinking in Maybe I'm new at this Or is it just your reaction Be my illusion, and I'll Be your distraction I'll take you on I'll take you on
