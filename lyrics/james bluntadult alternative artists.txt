My life is brilliant My life is brilliant, my love is pure I saw an angel, of that I'm sure She smiled at me on the subway She was with another man But I won't lose no sleep on that'Cause I've got a plan You're beautiful, you're beautiful You're beautiful, it's true I saw your face, in a crowded place And I don't know what to do'Cause I'll never be with you Yeah, she caught my eye, as I walked on by She could see from my face that I was, fucking high And I don't think that I'll see her again But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end You're beautiful, you're beautiful You're beautiful, it's true I saw your face, in a crowded place And I don't know what to do'Cause I'll never be with youYour mouth is a revolver, firing bullets in the sky Your love is like a soldier, loyal 'till you die And I’ve been looking at the stars for a long, long time I’ve been putting out fires all my life Everybody wants a flame, they don’t want to get burnt And today is our turn Days like these lead to Nights like this lead to Love like ours You light the spark in my bonfire heart People like us, we don’t Need that much, just some One that starts, starts the spark in our bonfire hearts This world is getting colder, strangers passing by No one offers you a shoulder, no one looks you in the eye, eye, eye But I’ve been looking at you for a long, long time Just trying to break through, trying to make you mine Everybody wants a flame, they don’t want to get burnt Well, today is our turn Days like these lead to Nights like this lead to Love like ours You light the spark in my bonfire heart People like us, we don’t Need that much, just some One that starts, starts the spark in our bonfire heartsDid I disappoint you or let you down Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown Cause I saw the end before we'd begun Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won So I took what's mine by eternal right Took your soul out into the night It may be over but it won't stop there I am here for you, if you'd only care You touched my heart, you touched my soul You changed my life and all my goals And love is blind but that I knew when My heart was blinded by yours I've kissed your lips and held your hand Shared your dreams and shared your bed I know you well, I know your smell I've been addicted to you Goodbye my lover Goodbye my friend You have been the one You have been the one for me Goodbye my lover Goodbye my friend You have been the one You have been the one for meOh, before they turn off all the lights I won't read you your wrongs or your rights The time has gone I'll tell you goodnight, close the door Tell you "I love you" once more The time has gone, so here it is I'm not your son, you're not my father We're just two grown men saying goodbye No need to forgive, no need to forget I know your mistakes and you know mine And while you're sleeping, I'll try to make you proud So, daddy, won't you just close your eyes Don't be afraid, it's my turn To chase the monsters away Oh, well I'll read a story to you Only difference is this one is true The time has gone I folded your clothes on the chair I hope you sleep well, don't be scared The time has gone, so here it isSimona You're getting older Your journey's been Etched on your skin Simona Wish I had known that What seemed so strong Has been and gone I would call you up every Saturday night And we'd both stay out 'til the morning light And we sang "Here we go again."And though time goes by I will always be in a club with you in 1973 Singing "Here we go again."Simona Wish I was sober So I could see clearly now The rain has gone Simona I guess it's over My memory plays our tune The same old songIt’s been lonely Tryna get your attention from a thousand miles away And you know me Always overthinking the worst possibilities Yeah, we both know In between you and me, there’s an ocean Castaway in a sea and it’s frozen I’m exposed, can’t you see  All I need is a little warmth Without your arms around me, without you on my skin Without you on my body, I’m sorry, I’m sorry I don’t mean to be desperate or pretend that I’m not torn But I don’t want to let go of the things that keep me warm Without you, I’m just cold I built a little boat With a sail from the memories I’ve been collecting And I’ll hold out For the wind to blow me, take me home the whole way, in your direction Yeah, we both know In between you and me, there’s an ocean And I’m just trying to get a little closer Pull me in, 'cause I’m here, and all I need is little warmthShe said to me, "Go steady on me"Won't you tell me what the wise men said When they came down from heaven Smoked nine till seven All the shit that they could find But they couldn't escape from you Couldn't be free of you And now they know there's no way out And they're really sorry now for what they've done They were three wise men just tryna have some fun Look who's alone now It's not me, it's not me Those three wise men They've got a semi by the sea Gotta ask yourself the question Where are you now Gotta ask yourself the question Where are you now Really sorry now, they weren't to know They got caught up in your talent show With you pernickety little bastards in your fancy dress Who just judge each other and try to impressTrouble is her only friend and he's back again Makes her body older than it really is She says it's high time she went away No one's got much to say in this town Trouble is the only way is down Down, down As strong as you were, tender you go I'm watching you breathing for the last time A song for your heart, but when it is quiet I know what it means and I'll carry you home I'll carry you home If she had wings she would fly away And another day God will give her some Trouble is the only way is down Down, down As strong as you were, tender you go I'm watching you breathing for the last time A song for your heart, but when it is quiet I know what it means and I'll carry you home I'll carry you homeBeautiful dawn Lights up the shore for me There is nothing else in the world I'd rather wake up and see with you Beautiful dawn I'm just chasing time again Thought I would die a lonely man In endless night But now I'm high Running wild among all the stars above Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me Beautiful dawn Melts with the stars again Do you remember the day when my journey began Will you remember the end of time Beautiful dawn You're just blowing my mind again Thought I was born to endless night, until you shineIt's a little after midnight There's a couple in the corner And I wonder what he said because she's crying And I guess they won't remember When they wake up in the morning With the headache from the whiskey and the wine I know that I have said things I regret when I am sober'Cause we always hurt the ones we love the most I messed up and I know it, if I hurt you girl I'm sorry But it's good to see the girl I used to know We could dance but I can't dance Maybe we could stick to holding hands Or should we raise a glass And forget the past If we keep on drinking we gon' fall back in love So fill it up, fill it up We must not be thinking 'cause we can't get enough So fill it up, fill it up Bartender, can you pour some love Bartender, can you pour some love
