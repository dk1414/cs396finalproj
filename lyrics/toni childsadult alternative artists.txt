I keep finding this decision hard I keep finding a room that's in the dark I don't know, shed some light on it Maybe save me from what i'm feeling this lonely day Cause the secret's out and the secret's clear What I want Yes I want to walk with you I want to hear you say "Yes I want that too"I want to walk, I want to walk with you I want to hear you say "Yes I want that too"Can I tell you wht I cannot tell myself In my thoughts there's a voice calling"You will be lost"In my life I deny, deny this heavy load And obsession is clearly my need to know Can I let it out, can I let you know What I want I don't want to run from this It seem's like it'd be hard to do now I don't want to lose my head Falling down infront of you I don't want to lose my head now It could be so easy to do If I could find a reason why I'd stay here, stay here, stay here Stay here, stayI see angels I see devils in me too And yes I am angry and frustrated too I'm no different, different than you And I've been hurt And wounded And yes, I've been abused Now I can see you Holding out your hand Hoping that, someone will, finally understand That you're beautiful Yes you're beautiful You are beautiful You are beautiful Deep in the silence, before the dawn The wounded, the battle scarred The nicks and the cutWhy you look so sad When the sky is perfect blue And you're getting everything You ever wanted to Let's no talk about the bad times We've been through that before And it's not right For making love anymore So stop your fussin', boy Please, stop your fussin', boy Your time will come Yes, your time will come Can you lay me down In meadows soft and green And can you lay me down And talk to me of things Like stars that burn into the night And moons that turn with purple lines That's what I want Just stop your fussin', Boy Please, stop your fussin', boy Your time will comeDon't walk away Ripping out the root of love Don't walk away Ripping out the root of love Tell me now what is in my heart The kind of lies that have torn us apart You lay down in the road Baring your bloody soul Don't need no satisfaction Guaranteed my main attraction Ripping love out by the roots Though my ghost is still with you It hurts to watch you turn away So I'm tearing out the truth Don't walk away Ripping out the root of love Don't walk away Ripping out the root of love Don't walk away Ripping out the root of love Don't walk away Ripping out the root of loveHush, now And go to sleep Go to sleep my baby Go to sleep my baby Let me welcome you to this world And let me tell you of my world How it is And how it is You want to know now I want to say that it's a bad world And tell you that it's so, so bad I don't want to disappoint you my child But this world is gonna take you Gonna take you by storm child You will be hurt and there will be pain, yeah But there will be love just the same, yeah Welcome to the world my boy and girl Welcome to the world, welcome to the world Welcome to the world child And all it has in store You will do what you do What you choose any old time And take how you take You'll begin to find That fight as you fight as you will in life Solutions, confusions Won't you take this time nowI heard a man who called me I heard his name unfold I heard a man who called me I heard his spirit told I heard a music in me I heard a sound inside I heard a man remind me Of what lives inside Doo do a doo doo How do you love And how do you care And how do you live and believe Do you look away I heard a music in me I heard a sound inside I heard a man remind me Of what lives inside Doo do a do do d-do How do you love And how do you care How do you live and believe Do you look away This man I married is buried deep And the more I try to wake him, the more he sleeps I used to think I knew this man The tenderness, not the back of his hand It's been two weeks since he last had a drink But the time bombs ticking, I can never sleep It would be easier if he did Why do you stay here, stay with him Why do you do it Why do you treat us bad When you've got two kids that love you And a wife that's missing you bad I've got to go now I've got to say goodbye Don't try to stop us now And please don't you cry Can't you see  we've all been through it It's all been said before With all these fears For how many years can I keep coming Back for more No more Must be addicted to all this pain Cause I keep coming back for the shame Dear god give me the strength to leave I've got to keep going, keep going this timeI'm breathing in life I'm breathing in her I'm breathing in the darkness of what it is to live Its beautiful here I'm breathing in life I'm breathing in blood I'm breathing in the liquid of life and holy joy Its beautiful here There is saftey in my ears Its wonderful to be here with you I'm feeling safe inside you And I'm feeling like life would inside you The blood in the river is safe We are one with you here the safe Mother can you tell me please Am I safe I've decided for the world I've decided to be born And I've decided for the world And I've decided to be born What will I think of this world Used to sit and wonder what to do And I still do when I'm feeling blue Fearful that my struggle with life will never end Help me please to stop This fear in motion These circles turn me Someone help me put this fire out Yes they hurt me Yes they turn me Someone help me put this fire out Running, I am scared what I will see If I look inside, deep these wounds of mine Hurting me so long I can't ignore them anymore Help me please to find Innocence is lost on the small Mama said early, early on But what was visible to me in my dreams Is that the pain was all I could ever see And it moves me Yes it turns me Someone help me put this fire out Yes it hurts me Yes it turns me Someone help me put this fire outA man I met in my youth Came to me in the light of truth A beautiful dream that was Till he died one rainy fall There I was a child bride Widowed at ninteen, defied Never would I let him go Go to the place that heaven knows On the evening of his death My shoulders felt a brushing breath Cold were his hands on my breast The man that I loved and put to rest He came to me and held me close We danced til dawn in the early snow There I felt him cry and cry"I'll never leave, leave your side"Oh the madness This town thinks I'm mad Sixty years, has it been a dream This man I'm haunted by, I see I'm eighty years and on my bed Awaiting death, that final breath He sits by and looks to me"Soon you will come and be with me"Now I feel all warm inside As I leave this mortal body behind Seems it is eternal's way We're waltzing into heaven's gate
