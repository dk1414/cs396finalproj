All our times have come Here, but now they're gone Seasons don't fear the Reaper Nor do the wind, the sun, or the rain Come on, baby Baby, take my hand We'll be able to fly Baby, I'm your man La, la, la, la, la La, la, la, la, la Valentine is done Here, but now they're gone Romeo and Juliet Are together in eternity 40,000 men and women everyday 40,000 men and women everyday Another 40,000 coming everyday Come on, baby Baby, take my hand We'll be able to fly Baby, I'm your man La, la, la, la, la La, la, la, la, laHome in the valley, home in the city Home isn't pretty, ain't no home for me Home in the darkness, home on the highway Home isn't my way, home I'll never be Burn out the day Burn out the night I can't see no reason to put up a fight I'm livin' for givin' the devil his due An' I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you!Time is the essence, time is the season Time ain't no reason, got no time to slow Time everlasting, time to play B-sides Time ain't on my side, time I'll never know Burn out the day Burn out the night I'm not the one to tell you what's wrong and what's right I've seen suns that were freezing and lives that were throughYou see me now, a veteran of a thousand psychic wars I've been livin' on the edge so long where the winds of limbo roar And I'm young enough to look at and far too old to see All the scars are on the inside I'm not sure that there's anything left to me Don't let these shakes go on, it's time we had a break from it It's time we had some leave We've been livin' in the flames, we've been eatin' up our brains Oh, please, don't let these shakes go on You ask me why I'm weary, why I can't speak to you You blame me for my silence, say it's time I changed and grew But the war's still going on, dear, and there's no end that I know And I can't say if we're ever I can't say if we're ever gonna be free Don't let these shakes go on, it's time we had a break from it It's time we had some leave We've been living in the flames, we've been eating up our brains Oh, please, don't let these shakes go onThe clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst Out at you from their hiding place Like acid and oil on a madman's face His reason tends to fly away Like lesser birds on the four winds Like silver scrapes in May Now, the sands become a crust And most of you have gone away Come Susy dear, let's take a walk Just out there upon the beach I know you'll soon be married And you want to know where winds come from Well, it's never said at all On the map that Carrie reads Behind the clock back there you know At the four winds bar Hey  Hey  Hey  Hey!Four winds at the four winds bar Two doors barred and windows barred One door let to take you in The other one just mirrors it Hey  Hey  Hey  Hey!In hellish glare and inference The other one's a duplicate The queenly flux, eternal light Or the light that never warms Yes, the light that never, never warms Or the light that never, never warms Never warms, never warmsParched land, no desert sand, the sun is just a dot And a little bit of water goes a long way 'cause Three good buddies were laughin’ and smokin’In the back of a rented Ford They couldn't know they weren't going far Each one with the money in his pocket To go out and buy himself a brand new car But they all held the money they had Money they hoped would take them very far Sky’s bright, the traffic light, now and then a truck And they hadn't seen a cop around all day They brought everything they needed Bags and scales to weigh the stuff The driver said, "The border's just over the bluff"It wasn't until the car suddenly stopped In the middle of a cold and barren plain And the other guy turned and spilled Three boys' blood, did they know a trap had been laid They’re okay, the last days of May, but I’ll be breathin’ dry air I’m leaving soon, the others are already there Wouldn’t be interested in coming along instead of staying here It’s said the West is nice this time of year, that’s what they sayWith a purposeful grimace and a terrible sound He pulls the spitting high-tension wires down Helpless people on subway trains Scream, bug-eyed, as he looks in on them He picks up a bus and he throws it back down As he wades through the buildings toward the center of town Oh, no, they say he's got to go Go  Go  Godzilla, yeah Oh, no, there goes Tokyo Go  Go  Godzilla, yeah Oh, no, they say he's got to go Go  Go  Godzilla, yeah Oh, no, there goes Tokyo Go  Go  Godzilla, yeah Godzilla  God  God  God  God God  God  God  God God  God  God  God God  God  God

Daishikyu hinan shite kudasai!God  God  God  God God  God  God  God Well I've opened up my veins too many times And the poison's in my heart and in my mind Poison's in my bloodstream, poison's in my pride I'm after rebellion, I'll settle for lies Is it any wonder that my mind's on fire Imprisoned by the thought of what to do Is it any wonder that my joke's in ire And the joke's on you Experiments that failed too many times Transformations that were too hard to find Poison's in my bloodstream, poison's in my pride I'm after rebellion, I'll settle for lies Yes, I know the secrets of the iron and mind They're trinity acts, a mineral fire Yes, I know the secrets of the circuitry mind It's a flaming wonder telepathI am becalmed Lost to nothing Warm weather and Holocaust Left to die by two good friends Abandoned me and put to sleep Left to die by two good friends Tears of god flow as I bleed So ladies, fish, and gentlemen Here's my angled dream See me in the blue sky bag And meet me by the sea!Oyster boys are Swimming for me now Save me from the Death-like creatures Oyster boys are swimming now Hear them chatter on the tide We understand, we understand But fear is real and so do IYou're over my shoulder, I think I'm possessed Your constant undertone, is making me toothless Time’s come to trim you, gonna get out my knife Gonna cut you out, baby, out of my life I love you like sin, but I won't be your pigeon I love you like sin, but I won't be your pigeon The power that I give you, I'm so sick of your voice In my body, you don't give me no choice But to boot you, honey, to give you the shove So take back your despot, I'll keep your love I love you like sin, but I won't be your pigeon I love you like sin, but I won't be your pigeonYou're boned like a saint With the consciousness of a snake You're the kind of girl–kind of girl I'd like to find Face like an angel–in my mirror But you're boned like the devil Your eyes have shifted from me–have shift Everyone saw what you did–your eyes You have slipped from beneath me–from me Like a false and nervous squid Oh, no more horses, horses We're going to swim like a fish–we're gonna swim like a fish Into the hole in which you planned to ditch me My lovely, Vera Marie!I was soaring Planned to leave me cold–a sound But you'll never get your wish–feeling appeal On the twenty-fourth of May–birthday I gather up your reins You filled me with a vengeance–filled me And you touched me with your breath–vengeance I'm gonna pull you from this dance–this dance You're gonna ride so easily
