It's a little bit funny This feeling inside I'm not one of those who can easily hide I don't have much money, but boy if I did I'd buy a big house where we both could live If I was a sculptor, heh But then again, no Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do My gift is my song and this one's for you And you can tell everybody This is your song It may be quite simple, but now that it's done I hope you don't mind I hope you don't mind That I put down in the words How wonderful life is while you're in the world I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross But the sun's been quite kind While I wrote this song It's for people like you that keep it turned onYou could never know what it's like Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use And did you think this fool could never win Well look at me, I'm a-comin' back again I got a taste of love in a simple way And if you need to know while I'm still standin'You just fade away Don't you know I'm still standin' better than I ever did Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid And I'm still standin' after all this time Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind I'm still standin' I'm still standin' Once, I never coulda hoped to win You're startin' down the road, leavin' me again The threats you made were meant to cut me down And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by nowHey kids, shake it loose together The spotlight's hitting something That's been known to change the weather We'll kill the fatted calf tonight so stick around You're gonna hear electric music, solid walls of sound Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet Ooh, but they're so spaced out B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful Oh, Bennie, she's really keen She's got electric boots, a mohair suit You know I read it in a magazine, oh B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets Hey kids, plug into the faithless Maybe they're blinded, but Bennie makes them ageless We shall survive, let us take ourselves along Where we fight our parents out in the streets To find who's right and who's wrongShe packed my bags last night, pre-flight Zero hour, 9 a.m.​​And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife It's lonely out in space On such a timeless flight And I think it's gonna be a long, long time'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find I'm not the man they think I am at home Oh, no, no, no I'm a rocket man Rocket man burnin' out his fuse up here alone And I think it's gonna be a long, long time'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find I'm not the man they think I am at home Oh, no, no, no I'm a rocket man Rocket man burnin' out his fuse up here alone Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids In fact, it's cold as hell And there's no one there to raise them if you did And all the science, I don't understand It's just my job five days a week A rocket man A rocket manWhen are you gonna come down When are you going to land I should have stayed on the farm I should have listened to my old man You know you can't hold me forever I didn't sign up with you I'm not a present for your friends to open This boy's too young to be singin' the blues Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah Ah-ah-ah, ah So goodbye yellow brick road Where the dogs of society howl You can't plant me in your penthouse I'm goin' back to my plough Back to the howlin' old owl in the woods Huntin' the horny-back toad Oh, I've finally decided my future lies Beyond the yellow brick road Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah Ah-ah-ah, ahBlue jean baby, L.A  lady Seamstress for the band Pretty-eyed, pirate smile You'll marry a music man Ballerina, you must've seen her Dancing in the sand And now she's in me, always with me Tiny dancer in my hand Jesus freaks out in the street Handing tickets out for God Turning back, she just laughs The boulevard is not that bad Piano man, he makes his stand In the auditorium Looking on, she sings the songs The words she knows, the tune she hums But, oh, how it feels so real Lying here with no one near Only you, and you can hear me When I say softly, slowlyI can't light no more of your darkness All my pictures seem to fade to black and white I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me Frozen here on the ladder of my life Too late to save myself from falling I took a chance and changed your way of life But you misread my meanin' when I met you Closed the door and left me blinded by the light Don't let the sun go down on me Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see I'd just allow a fragment of your life  to wander free But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me I can't find, oh, the right romantic line But see me once and see the way I feel Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm But these cuts I have, oh, they need love to help them heal Don't let the sun go down on me Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see I'd just allow a fragment of your life  to wander free But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on meIt's a human sign When things go wrong When the scent of her lingers And temptation's strong Cold, cold heart Hardened by you Some things lookin' better, baby Just passin' through And I think it's gonna be a long, long time'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find I'm not the man they think I am at home Oh no, no, no And this is what I should have said Well, I thought it, but I kept it hidThere's a calm surrender to the rush of day When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away An enchanted moment, and it sees me through It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you And can you feel the love tonight It is where we are It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer That we got this far And can you feel the love tonight How it's laid to rest It's enough to make kings and vagabonds Believe the very best There's a time for everyone if they only learn That the twistin' kaleidoscope moves us all in turn There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours And can you feel the love tonight It is where we are It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer That we got this far And can you feel the love tonight How it's laid to rest It's enough to make kings and vagabonds Believe the very bestBuild the fire and gather 'round the tree Fill the glass and maybe come and sing with me So kiss me under the mistletoe Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go Next year, you never know But for now, Merry Christmas, we'll Dance in the kitchen while embers glow We've both known love, but this love we got is the bеst of all I wish you could see you through my eyes, then you would know My God, you look bеautiful Right now, Merry Christmas The fire is raging on And we'll all sing along to the song Just having so much fun While we're here, can we all Spare a thought for the ones who have gone Merry Christmas, everyone Ah-ah-ah-ah Ah-ah-ah-ah
