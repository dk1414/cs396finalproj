Bugzy Malone You know Mr Sno Wman on production Watch this, I got a brand new three bedroom crib Spotlights in the ceiling it's sick Got a beanbag in the computer room All I need now is Grand Theft Auto: Six Got an office and everything cocaine white In the morning it can get too bright But it doesn't affect me these days 'cause I've been staying up way too deep in the night Thinking about before it all went bad Before the day I met my real dad Before I knew about money and bills and how they both made my mum get sad Sat counting about twenty-five bags I'm running out of elastic bands'Cause It turns out, when you make money on the road there's nothing you can do with the cash So I jump in the S-Line driving fast Hope I don't bump into my step-dad'Cause they say mental abuse is worse than physical abuse and I wanna get him back But I don't wanna do another custodial sentence In a four-by-four pad And I gotta take this time to apologise to my best friend 'cause we almost crashed Let me try and explain It's intricate because I've never been plain It's intimate because I never contacted a counsellor to get rid of this pain I walk with it and now I'm going insane Losing control of my own brain Watching documentaries on serial killers and feeling that I can relate Do you find that strange Yeah  Ok  Well let me get this straight If I get a life sentence or I don't make it, it's 'cause I could not handle the pain I don't wanna hear nobody complain About that's good talent gone to waste'Cause if I didn't go through what I went through, you would have never downloaded my mixtapeDrove past my mum's old house on Bury New Road The one she got evicted from Went to Mc Donald's Ordered a cheeseburger and chips on an addicted one Then I heard: "Can I get a picture "Stood there and I took fifteen pictures, don With fifteen different kids I was there on the phone but I left tongue twisted, don I know I paint pictures with words But I didn't know I was the gifted one And now they say I put Manny on the map So I hashtag 0161 Drove back past my mums house Looked through the window on a reminiscent one Shouldn't have done that Cus now I'm having flashbacks of the days when I had hectic fun On Super Mario, Donkey Kong And I was on my Nintendo all day long I could hear loud shouting downstairs Back and forth like ping pong The gift came with a curse Ever since ten years old my head's been gone Now I wanna climb to the top of the Empire State Building Just like King Kong Had problems with the D VL A so I was on the bus arriving late But now the S-Line floats like a butterfly I'm feeling like Cassius Clay But I'm not a heavyweight The only thing heavy is the weight of the world on my shoulder I used to be afraid of an older until I put five bullets in a revolver I was cold then, now I'm colder I was voice note lyrics you write in a folder I'll build up your lyrics into a rizzla And blaze them like I was a stoner If you see me and I'm sober Thinkin', know that I'm an imploder That means I hold it in but if I explode I'll be like Vinegar and Baking Soda Jesus I've got them thinking 'is this guy from Manchester 'The wordplays heavy just like Sylvester And I'm takin' over like I'm on a Vespa And when I say I've got boxes of cheese I'm not talking about Red Leicester And why do I laugh at M C's A king will always laugh at a Jester A Porsche will always pass a Fiesta You're lookin' at Manchester's best I'm from a place where nobody's impressed And don't wanna see nobody progress So they take shots at my ego But I got a built-in stab-proof vest I've been stabbed in the back so much I'm like Jesus in the Passion of Christ I was sat countin' about twenty-five grand I got delusional The Queen started talking I was like: "Queen, why is everyone warring "She said: "Politics are boring"Cause it's all propaganda And comes down to the fact that money's more important Than poverty and feeding the poor The rich get rich, we get ignored Middle-class people That have done everything that the Government told 'em Struggle to pay bills Cause when they go to the bank they say their accounts been frozen So damn right I'm taking doors off hinges I'm running in through the hallway Holding a big boy sword like a Viking But I never been from Norway Anybody comes at me I stick it right in Cus I don't do foreplay I make a man bleed sick So he looks like Tomato Puree You're lookin' at Bugzy Malone Every video is a new part of my story And I was born back in 1990 So were on about episode forty I say look when I'm spittin'Cause I spit bars in high definition It's like watching a widescreen television And this one here's like 007, why Cause I'm on a one-man mission To put my town on the map I'm reppin'But I'm worse than a Nuclear weapon Cause I'll make your whole town go missing I know when I've said suttin' sick When I see a man's head start tiltin I'm like Wolverine from the X-Men Cus the metal is built in I've not set fire to the booth I've set fire to the whole building Charlie was gonna jump out the window Cause the smoke in the room could've killed him Drove past my mum's old house on Bury New Road The one I got evicted from Drove straight past Onto the motorway and straight into the distance don Looked in the rear view mirror Thinking about the past, on a majestic one Cause if I didn't go through what I went through Then I probably woulda never wrote this songIt can be a warning to anyone, like I said  When we hear funny 'tings  If that's..  if it goes just over sixty percent of the mark of,  'That could be at Chip', and you're in the Premier League, 'cause it goes right down to conference   Let's not- let's not get it twisted in this rap thing; I'll be at your neck, rudeboy!Mh, hold tight Zdot on production I got a phone call from Jammer'Cause Chip wants to know if it's beef or music And Chip don't want no trouble Chip definitely doesn't wanna see me when I lose it Alright Jammer, come, let's do this I grab Chip in a headlock and use him I'm from a little town called Manchester I'm about to do this million views 'ting Check my Fire in the Booth, it's moving Chipmunks Fire in the Booth was borin'I set fire to the building Chip made everybody in the building start snoring It's meant to grime, he's talking pop politics Like any of that's important I think Chip might've missed his callin'He could've been a teacher with all that talking Wait, maybe he's falling, into depression, but that's just me How many of your chains are in one piece Or did they all get popped off Don't talk about shows in my town Like your lickle show can't get locked off I turn into the devil, take off the door Then I let two-two shots off Pap  Pap She sits and cries about the times we were low And when her family ask about me she says we're cool Tell her not to cry no more'Cause I'm coming home, I'm coming home The phone vibrated twice, I looked but I still didn't read it Cause I knew they was gonna stress me out and right now I don't need it She told me she was leaving I gave her too many reasons She told me that I don't care, but I told her I'm no good with my feelings When I first met her, I'm not gonna lie I was struggling sleeping Then she got a nigga dreaming And then helped me achieving Alright fuck it let's read it, she said the roads won't love you like I will and I'm starting to believe it In fact, I'm starting to feel it Back then I was driving with no license I was struggling with violence The man said twelve pounds for two tickets Then there was an awkward silence She had to pay me into the cinema And at that point I was frightened Do I tell her that I fell off or do I lie Either way, she was smiling I told that I'm gonna be somebody, must have been hard to believe, when I'm sat there bagging up weed, breaking down twenty-eight G's And that was in Bury New Road Bedroom stinking cheese But she was on a ride or die 'ting We're like Beauty and the BeastIf you wanna know something 'bout me The blood in my veins is full of northern grit I got that northern soul, man I got bags of it We're far from ordinary people And if you wanna know something 'bout us The hearts in our chest are full of northern love And even when we're broke, we'll always have enough We're far from ordinary people Alright how can I say this I'm from a place where, no-one expects us to make it There was The Stone Roses and Oasis But when they were big we were still babies I'm talking to the new generation And we wasn't born in the 80s They say that we don't see many places'Cause nobody left here for ages Serious love for the people that raised us Even though it got crazy Poverty stricken but that never phased us Not one of us lazy And I'll be the first to say money don't change us Well it didn't change me I'll never forget where I came from - that's 'cause It's the struggle that saved me On the streets we got brought up And we'd play on the grass 'cause we're tryna be pro footballers They say there's no kings out here, nobody's got money, everyone of us paupers I beg to differ..  'cause I see the bigger picture Every one of us kings We could live on the street And make it a castle Fuck what they call us They can keep throwing out orders In fact bring cameras and record us We've been fighting for survival And you're gonna learn what war does Why did they call it an army That's 'cause it's filled with soldiers There's a war going on outside and it's life You can keep the revolversNa-na-na-na-na, ay Na-na-na-na-na, gun 'ting Na-na-na-na-na, Batman Na-na-na-na-na, blac, blac  Pow!Everything black on the C63 for real impact Man could never tell me that I'm whack When I'm

Wman on production You know how it goes Seems like I'm achieving my goals Got retweeted by the M OB O's And I felt like David Beckham back in '96 After scoring seventeen goals I made a Fire in the Booth and the Relegation Riddim And Manchester united So now I say "0161, Manny on the map"And the mandem get excited Now it's all hectic in man's city Let's get down to the nitty gritty I came from the bottom into the premiership Now I'm notorious like Biggie Now it's all glorious, I'm ready And I'm so curious already'Cause right now life feels like I'm watching the Fast and Furious on telly I'm not used to the limelight, I rhyme tight But I usually drive round on a dark night with a grime beat on Now I'm getting played on Radio 1 Xtra, the best station that I've been on Sat looking at my Mum We went from sitting on a visit in jail To looking in the rear view mirror Into the past and waving goodbye to the slumWhen I was about ten Ended up robbing all of my school friends For the Pokemon cards, finger skateboards Six years before I ever went pen Five years before I got expelled Four years before I got kicked out Three years before I was a good student Two years before I got missed out of Santa Claus He didn't wanna bring me nuttin''Cause I was underprivileged That means now I walk with a complex And trust me I try my best to get rid of this I want more money than you consider rich I was on the roads and I didn't give a shit'Cause I was taking phones and taking bikes And I swear my niggas was killin' it Chillin' with D, blazing weed Sat back watching reservoir dogs Used to sell white and B for a boss Until I licked off like twenty-five Oz That's when I realised we was a gold mine Was only eleven more z's in a box And I was seventeen, fresh outta jail Rollin' with a pedal bike and a dog I p-p-p-paint pictures with words And I paint them like Vincent Van Gogh Still spending money from '08 And I've still not taken the bands off Still got access to the sawn-off Still got more brothers than Warner Still on this music 'ting and I'm still in the gym And I can still hold my cornerAh, they say life's not about waiting for the storm to pass It's about learning to dance in the rain Bugzy Malone You know  Watch this It's not physical pain, it's psychological pain Emotionally scarred so bad I was wearing a mask like Bane Not an actual mask, a psychological mask What do you find that mad What about a kid that had to find his dad Only to find that he didn't like him back Not physical pain, psychological pain I seen it from the beginning, I was there on the wedding day The happiest kid in the world when I'd seen the smile on my mum's face I thought it was real I heard the vows, I threw the confetti Little did I know it was fake Not physical pain, it's psychological pain Everything I loved in life just went up in flames I went from cold to freezing I watched the family break into pieces I thought that adults could iron out creases I thought family was cousins and nephews and nieces, not arguments and police Not physical pain, it's psychological pain And if you look closely enough you can see the pain in my face All the confusion, too many lies It's all an illusion, nobody tries to understand You get kicked to the kerb and nobody says one word
