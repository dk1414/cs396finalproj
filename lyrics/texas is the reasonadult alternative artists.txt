This town was built on miles of hope And I dare you to give me one reason to stay And maybe I won't go away So far you've only dared me once And I think we know that's not even close enough Not enough for me to stay It costs so much I know But I guess I need to know What it would have felt like to be right But I'm getting tired all over again so hurry up And get here because I'm still waiting Just like I've always been Well I'm getting tired of standing around Just sitting here and waiting to be found Same old shit just a different day Well I'll wait around for one more day But I know that's what I will always say Will this ever be okay Well, I think I finally thought of how to act every time you come around I think I'm finally sick of faking it But I hate you all and that's for free and that's what makes it easy for me Well, it took me long enough But I won't tell anyone But I won't tell anyone I've got to fool myself into believing that I'm right this time It's the only thing that makes sense to me But unfortunately I'm not impressed with anyone or anything So you should quit while you're ahead But I won't tell anyone Would you know what to say Would you know how to feel I won't tell anyone, I won't tell anyoneSo now it's your turn to tell me that I'm wrong I've never seen anything quite like it I always miss, I always miss I'm asking you to smile because that's what I like best I need to be this far away from you to understand that I can do this You act like I don't know my own way home Can you guess what kind of mood he's in Well he just found out that she's in love with just the thought of him You act like I don't know my own way homeIt's all about a secret I have Or kept or stole from you It's all about not knowing If I missed out on something new You only know what I know I never meant to keep you in the dark It doesn't mean much coming from me You want to laugh like they laugh Well, go ahead and laugh your face off, faker Just make sure to leave me home It's all about a secret I have Or kept or stole from you It's all about not knowing If I missed out on something new You only know what I know I never meant to keep you in the dark It doesn't mean much coming from me You want to laugh like they laugh Go ahead and laugh your face off, faker Just make sure to leave me homeI have to learn to never ever be late And how to almost always be on time I have to understand this time It's too bad that this side of you Can't be seen by everyone So now you've got something to forget I have to learn how to remember to forget And how to build this all again I have to build this all again This is only fun for meYou're not telling me nothing that I haven't You're not telling me nothing that I haven't Heard before Nothing that I haven't You'll have to try harder than that You'll have to dig deeper than that Reminds me of myself You'll have to try harder than that You'll have to dig deeper than that Reminds me of yourself You can't hold your breath when you talk Try not to let sound slip by I come from inside you Raise it up so I can see Just what you're doing to me Do you even know why You can't hold your breath when you You can't hold your breath when you talkYou're allowed to stay for a while I´m going to need your time to slow down and Waste some time again I would have thought by now you would be So sick of being sick of trying all the time Well I guess I'm sick of hearing it So sick of listening to it You're allowed to stay for a while I´m going to need your time to slow down and Waste some time again I would have thought by now you would be So sick of being sick of trying all the time Well I guess I'm sick of hearing it So sick of listening to it Everybody tells me something Something different every time I´ll make up my own mind Just let me sit here for a whileIt's getting cold all over again So I'll be inside way too much again You´ll have to believe me You have to hear me when I say And I´ll make up something that Just so that you´ll believe in me It's getting cold all over again And I'll be inside way too much again This is becoming too routine for me For me There will be time for this tomorrow But it´s days like this that keep me alive Is there anything left for me Is there anything left for me Daylight´s almost over now Can't think of anymore to say Even if I try to understand It won't ever be the same So you're expecting me to just sit back down and let this pass me by You want it all to be sussed out without ever really trying Maybe with you on my side, I'll be able to reach the sky You think you finally figured it out Me, myself, I'll never learn You think you finally figured it out Me, myself, I'll never learn Maybe with you on my side, we'll be able to reach the sky You finally found meThere's no way I can talk myself out of this one tonight And there's no way that I can ever win with you I've sung the same song I've sang it for way too long And now the melody is finally escaping me There's no way I can talk myself out of this one tonight Every one is my last I swear that this is my last I've sung the same song I've sang it for way too long And now the melody is finally escaping me By now you should know what to say By now you should know all of this by heart By now you should know what to say
