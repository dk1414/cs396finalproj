tonight While you roam like a serpent satellite So tell me why it don't feel the same Tell me why I've got to feel this way Yeah, you leave, you're gone And I'm left here with the blame So tell me why it don't feel the sameHitched a ride to the peaceful side of town Then proceeded where thieves were no longer found Can't crash now Well, I've been waiting for this Won't crash now I found some encouragement Precious declaration reads Yours is yours and mine you leave alone now Precious declaration says I believe all hope is dead no longer New meanings to the words I feed upon Wake within my veins elements of freedom Can't break now Well, I've been living for this Won't break now I'm cleansed with hopefulness
