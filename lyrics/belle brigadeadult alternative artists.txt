Did you hear about me Me and what I've done I wrote a letter to Sweet Louise I confessed my love And I thought that everyone would know by now I've been alive long enough to know How things just get around And everybody probably thinks I'm crazy Well, I'll just tell you now That I fell in love and I couldn't help myself I just fell in love and I couldn't help myself It was like a movie Watching her eyes read What I wrote made Sweet Louise Feel weak in her knees And I thought that everyone would know by now I've been alive long enough to know How things just get around And everybody probably thinks I'm crazyI drove a nail in the bottom of my walking boot So I wail every time I hit the floor I'm dragging and I'm bleeding I'm begging and I'm pleading Cause I thought you had another And you cannot have another lover I don't believe in loving with a ball and chain Cause I feel how it crippled me inside I thought you were a cheating I couldn't bear you leaving Now I know you didn't do it I need you to believe me When I say I didn't mean it I didn't mean it When I said I didn't mean it Baby, I didn't mean it So I accused you wrong Now I'm the guilty one Hey, give me my sentence I'll pay my penance Nothing kills me more Than the pain I have for hurting youThere will always be someone better than you Even if you're the best So let's stop the competition now Or we will both be losers And I'm ashamed I ever tried to be higher than the rest Brother, I am not alone We've all tried to be on top of the world somehow'Cause we have all been losers I don't wanna be laid down No I don't wanna die knowing That I spent so much time when I was young Just trying to be the winner So I wanna make it clear now I wanna make it known That I don't care about any of that shit no more Don't care about being a winner Or being smooth with women Or going out on Fridays Being the life of parties No, no more, noI wanna be a holy man I wanna kill your pain with the wave of my hand I wanna be the president I wanna sign away your debt with the stroke of my pen So don't tell me that I can never be like him'Cause ain't nothing need to stay the same way it's been Because I've seen the straight turn gay and the gay turn bi A bird learn to swim, and a fish learn to fly The drunk get dry and the fat get slim So don't you ever tell me that I can never be like him I wanna be a boxing champ I wanna knock you out and then shake your hand I wanna be a scientist I wanna blow up the basement and try it again So don't tell me that I can never be like him'Cause ain't nothing need to stay the same way it's beenI been thinking 'bout what happened back in '89 When I was born, my momma she almost died Seem like a hell of a way to start out for me Walk right in and cause such misery Oh, but now everything's all right Even though I think about dyin'But, when I forget about all the things I fear I'm a pretty lucky guy Today I really realize Spending most of my time hitting parties at night Getting high climbing trees in broad daylight I ain't never broken a bone in my life Sticks and stones and low-pitched groans Buddy I can tell when you're not being nice, oh But, when I forget about all the things I fear Well I'm a pretty lucky guy Today I really realize Hey hey, you get under my skin sometimes When you come-a on come-a on come on And pretend to be a friend of mine Hey hey whenever you roll those eyes It gets me low sometimes When I forget about all the shit you deal I'm a pretty lucky guy Today I really realizeA long winter and a red hot summer I don't remember very much about that year What I recall is a fear of falling in love While I was I gave everything I had to my lover It's no wonder people felt that I disappeared And at the end of the day all I had for myself Was my own lonesome tears But I made her happy And did that gladly But oh, it don't mean a thing Yeah all that's over now Me and my sister went to Arizona Seeing our mom while she was fighting her disease And doing what everybody said she needed So she could come home And it was late in the night when I called you One in the morning right outside of a motel Just checking in to tell you I was scared And that I feltHe's been licking wounds Since he was young But never known where the knife's coming from Things just turn him blue And he don't know why He's been that way his whole life But he keeps on waiting As if life was waiting for him He's likely to use something He might just abuse something And he might lose his mind He might lose his will to try Oh, but he'll be feeling alright Yeah yeah Yeah yeah She's been dreaming of love Since she was nine But never finds who she wants for her life Now she's twenty-five And thinks she's getting old And maybe thinks she should just stop tryingI don't wanna move on But I don't wanna stay here And if my life is a line All I see are the angles And there's a fence around my yard Don't wanna go back in time And I'm afraid of the future Just wish that everything worked How I imagine it used to When you were happy just because When you were angry just because When everything was what it was When everything was what it was When everything was what it was When everything was what it was So if you're readin' my palm And you can see where I'm going You could be right or wrong For me it's better not knowingIf you wanna derail this train Bend away the track, say you love me back The way I love you No whistle blows And the rhythm slows down A train without a will, happy standing still A rusted wheel So come on, come on, come on and Go away, take away from me your love Because, because, because It's everything I could ever need My love, it's true'Cause I don't I don't I don't want you To be just waiting at the station At my destination looking for me What keeps me rolling, rolling in locomotion Is chasing a dream, blowing out steam to look for you So come on, come on, come on and Go away, take away from me your love Because, because, because It's everything I could ever need Come on, come on, come on and Go away, take away from me your love Because, because, because It's everything I could ever need My love, you see'Cause I never, never wanted to beMy old home with flowers on all the tables Where did all that go I guess the flowers got old and died Wilted and dried from the son who was never that able To sit with you while you cried Now he's the one who's alone Yeah I'm trying Yeah I'm trying real hard Trying to build this thing back up from nothing But I'm shooting in the dark Keep on missing the mark, yeah But there's no doubt in my mind that I feel something Deep in my heart Hot on my head, yeah We are growin' older and bolder Trying to find the thread that connects our hearts Stretches so damn far, forget we're apart But now I got my head, said I'm tryin' to correct My growing list of wrongs And I'm surprised how it got this long And yeah I was a child but that don't cut it anymore Not like we're playing on any little swing set Is the world that's spinning 'round We get stuck to the ground, yeah But when we said that we could go higher Yeah I believed that And I feel it coming on It's why I wrote this song, yeah
