Our lovers' quarrel Hurts more than I can say All night Help me here Help me here 'Cause I can't help my mind from going there Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend Wanna meet at my place Heard that we both got nothing to do When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you Last night Damn, you were in my sex dreams Doing really nasty things Damn, you were in my sex dreams Making love in my sex dreams We could be caught We're both convicted criminals of thought Let's white Glove the bed Help me here 'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our headsYou're giving me a million reasons to let you go You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show You're givin' me a million reasons Give me a million reasons Givin' me a million reasons About a million reasons If I had a highway, I would run for the hills If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still But you're giving me a million reasons Give me a million reasons Givin' me a million reasons About a million reasons I bow down to pray I try to make the worst seem better Lord, show me the way To cut through all his worn out leather I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away But baby, I just need one good one to stay Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware'Cause you're giving me a million reasons Give me a million reasons Givin' me a million reasons About a million reasonsWish I could, I could've said goodbye I would've said what I wanted to Maybe even cried for you If I knew, it would be the last time I would've broke my heart in two Tryin' to save a part of you Don't want to feel another touch Don't wanna start another fire Don't wanna know another kiss No other name falling off my lips Don't wanna to give my heart away To another stranger Or let another day begin Won't even let the sunlight in No, I'll never love again I'll never love again Ooouuu ooou oou Oh When we first met I never thought that I would fall I never thought that I'd find myself Lying in your arms And I want to pretend that it's not true Oh baby, that you're gone'Cause my world keeps turning, and turning, and turning And I'm not movin' on
