Life's like a road that you travel on When there's one day here and the next day gone Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand Sometimes you turn your back to the wind There's a world outside every darkened door Where blues won't haunt you anymore Where the brave are free and lovers soar Come ride with me to the distant shore We won't hesitate, break down the garden gate There's not much time left today Life is a highway I want to ride it all night long If you're going my way I want to drive it all night long Through all the cities and all these towns It's in my blood and it's all around I love you now like I loved you then This is the road and these are the hills From Mozambique to those Memphis nights The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights Knock me down, get back up again You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely manWhen he was a kid, he'd be up at five Take shots 'til eight and make the thing drive Out after school and back on ice That was his life, he was gonna play in the big league The big league Not many ways out of this cold northern town You work in the mill and get laid in the ground And if you're going to jump it will be with the game Real fast and tough is the only clear lane to the big league My boy's going to play in the big league My boy's going to turn some heads My boy's going to play in the big league My boy's going to knock 'em dead The big league All the right moves when he turned eighteen Scholarship and school on a big U.S  team Out with his girl near Lake Mc Clean Hit a truck doing seventy in the wrong lane To the big league My boy's going to play in the big league My boy's going to turn some heads My boy's going to play in the big league My boy's going to knock 'em deadSo long so long so long he's been away So long so long so long he's back again When I turned seventeen We had passion, we had dreams Thought the love we were fighting for Was something holy, something more When I turned twenty-one We were outside on the run When I walked out with my girl We went halfway around the world CH OR US I dreamed I saw her standing there Running for the boy inside the man I was hit hard by the light so bright it burned All at once I knew she'd understand Boy inside the man The boy inside the man When I turned twenty-five We were hungry, we had drive When I turned much older then When the boy was lost in pride Now I just turned thirty-one I have lost and I have won Still I've kept my dreams alive'Cause the boy will never die CH OR US Ah do you understand CH OR USWaiting by the shoreline In Somalia for your reply I need you to come see me That's no lie The guns are getting closer The sweat pours like dew That fell from the trees in Tripoli In the spring I'm white hot I can't take it anymore I'm white hot By the Somalian shore White hot Yes I'm burning to the core I need rain Cast out from the jungle With no rations or canteen For selling faulty rifles To the thieves in Tanzania Adventures and misfortune Nothing wagered, nothing gained I have wandered through the desert Found the ocean not the rainI'm gonna check my scars at home Gonna cash my chips and roam Gonna walk before you fade to black I'm gonna write a new resume I'm gonna write you off the page Gonna take what we might take away And you might find a brighter day You might find a brighter day Oh, and in another year The pain will disappear And I will look back on this life as if it were a scene In a film somebody made for you and me I wish you well Oh, I wish you well I wish you well She wants to be set free Wants the space to feel love and be angry And I, I watch her bounce off the walls While the chips, they start to fall Then in a little while I see that distant smile returning Just like a ghost in a dream that we had way back when Then she'll turn and smile and say, come again Oh, and in another year The pain will disappear We'll look back on this life as if it were a scene Somebody wrote about you and me Somebody made about you and me Do you remember the night the lights went out All along the promenade It started to rain my coat, your dress got wet We laughed till we almost cried Your spirit was so contageous Our timing really bad You were so outrageous How could we hold back The secret is to know when to stop...The secret is to know when to stop...The secret is to know when to stop...Remembering Do you remember the night that we ran out Out on the English Bay We went out on the water The tow almost pulled us away Man, right there the sparks would fly We'd get into such a mess Our timing really stunk back then We didn't give a damn what they thought, I guess The secret is to know when to stop...The secret is to know when to stop...The secret is to know when to stop...RememberingShe's thinking about the prince and Cinderella And the outlaws, and the hustlers, and the heroes That never seem to fall It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what The outcome of the story is Because in real life I try to tell her It's not like that at all Oh, won't you please just hold out now'Cause there's some things I'd like you to forget When your world is sinking like a sunset Tales of Don Juan, they're very poetic, babe But out on the streets out there The true verse of life is written You know it's really a shame When you've got to let go of all the things you love Like a fighter he really bleeds When he must hang up his gloves No I am not a rock and I can feel it now But for a moment, I'd like to forget That my heart is sinking like a sunsetWalking by the roadside I see my fate written upon it I'm checkin' out the back here Where my race is not run Might hear a thousand harps of heaven Rain down upon her I can't stand and watch While you stand accused We got no regrets Might have seen better times But maybe we ain't been there yet Remember the good times And least you forget Have no regrets Sometimes you might find Like you feel that you're drowning Run for cover like some blown out fuse Remember one thing that you filed that number You can call me up baby you won't be refused Have no regrets Might have seen better times But maybe we ain't been there yet Remember the good times and least you forget Have no regretsHe says you want a brand new start She says that we've grown apart I know a thing or two I speak from the heart Don't insult me with what your friends say After all that we've been through You'd owe that to me like I'd owe that to you So go your own way and in time you'll see Exactly who your best friend was Your wise friends might say This is how we survive But I know in my own mind Can't you see it's a clever disguise This friendly advice We'd come such a long long way I don't give a damn baby what they say Your mind is full of wonders and that's o.k Didn't mean to lay your dreams so low And now you've made your choice I believe in my heart I know you like nobody else I know in my mind in time you'll see Exactly who your real friend was Friendly AdviceI was standing with my paper there Minding my own news For everything that someone said Someone else had a different view I watched the whole thing there Unfold upon my T.V  screen"A new World Order is on its way"Well pass the popcorn please You don't mean to tell me No one here is going to get hurt When there's folks at home who Eat dog food they can't afford a shirt Sure find out real fast who's a sitting duck When it's a Mad mad world Shake your hands and say good luck  It's a     Mad mad world I cannot believe this stuff  It's a     Mad mad world Getting madder every day Mad mad world Get involved and they blow you away Sure find out real fast when you're a sitting duck That it's a mad mad world
