Hey-hey-hey Yeah-ah Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay Were laid spread out before me, as her body once did All five horizons revolved around her soul as the Earth to the Sun Now the air I tasted and breathe has taken a turn Mmm, and all I taught her was everything Mmm-hmm, I know she gave me all that she wore And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds Of what was everything All the pictures had all been washed in black Tattooed everything I take a walk outside, I'm surrounded by some kids at play I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear Mmm, and twisted thoughts that spin 'round my head I'm spinning, oh-oh, I'm spinning How quick the Sun can drop away "Son," she said, "have I got a little story for you What you thought was your daddy was nothing but a...While you were sittin' home alone at age thirteen Your real daddy was dyin'Sorry you didn't see him, but I'm glad we talked"Oh, I, oh I'm still alive Hey, I, oh I'm still alive Hey, I, oh I'm still alive Hey, oh While she walks slowly across a young man's room She said, "I'm ready for you"Why, I can't remember anything to this very day'Cept the look, the look Oh, you know where, now I can't see, I just stare I, I'm still alive Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive, yeahAt home drawin' pictures of mountain tops With him on top, lemon yellow sun Arms raised in a "V"And the dead lay in pools of maroon below Daddy didn't give attention Oh, to the fact that mommy didn't care King Jeremy the wicked Oh, ruled his world Jeremy spoke in class today Jeremy spoke in class today Clearly, I remember picking on the boy Seemed a harmless little fuck Ooh, but we unleashed a lion Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast, how could I forget And he hit me with a surprise left My jaw left hurting, ooh, dropped wide open Just like the day, oh, like the day I heardUnsealed on a porch a letter sat Then you said I wanna leave it again Once I saw her on a beach of weathered sand And on the sand I wanna leave it again, yeah On a weekend wanna wish it all away And they called and I said that I want what I said And then I call out again And the reason oughta leave her calm, I know I said, I don't know whether I'm the boxer or the bag Oh yeah, can you see them Out on the porch Yeah, but they don't wave I see them'Round the front way, yeah And I know and I know, I don't wanna stay Make me cryFreezin'Rests his head on a pillow made of concrete, again Oh, feelin'Maybe he'll see a little better, set of days, ooh yeah Oh, hand out Faces that he sees time again ain't that familiar, ooh yeah Oh, dark grin He can't help, when he's happy he looks insane, hm yeah Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away Oh, someday yet, he'll begin his life again Life again, life again...Kneelin'Looking through the paper though he doesn't know to read, ooh yeah Oh, prayin'Now to something that has never showed him anything Oh, feelin'Understands the weather of the winter's on its way Oh, ceilings Few and far between all the legal halls of shame, heyWaitin', watchin' the clock It's four o'clock, it's got to stop Tell him, take no more, she practices her speech As he opens the door, she rolls over Pretends to sleep as he looks her over She lies and says she's in love with him Can't find a better man She dreams in color, she dreams in red Can't find a better man Can't find a better man Can't find a better man Oh Talking to herself, "There's no one else Who needs to know," she tells herself Memories back when she was bold and strong And waiting for the world to come along Swears she knew him, now she swears he's gone She lies and says she's in love with him Can't find a better man She dreams in color, she dreams in red Can't find a better man She lies and says she still loves him Can't find a better man She dreams in color, she dreams in red Can't find a better man Can't find a better man Can't find a better manAlone, listless Breakfast table in an otherwise empty room Young girl, violence Center of her own attention The mother reads aloud, child tries to understand it Tries to make her proud The shades go down, it's in her head Painted room, can't deny there's something wrong Don't call me daughter, not fit to The picture kept will remind me Don't call me daughter, not fit to The picture kept will remind me Don't call me She holds the hand that holds her down She will rise above Oooh oohConfusion is to commotion What love is to our devotion Imperceptibly big Big as the ocean And equally hard to control So save your predictions And burn your assumptions Love is friction Ripe for comfort Endless equations And tugging persuasions Doors open up To interpretation Expecting perfection leaves a lot to endure When the past is the present and the future's no more When every tomorrow is the same as before The looser things get The tighter you become The looser things get Tighter Not one man Can be greater than the sum That's not a negative thought I'm positive, positive, positive Falling down, not staying down Coulda held me up rather than tearing me down Drown in the riverI seem to recognize your face Haunting familiar, yet I can't seem to place it Cannot find the candle of thought to light your name Lifetimes are catching up with me All these changes taking place I wish I'd seen the place But no one's ever taken me Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away I swear I recognize your breath Memories, like fingerprints, are slowly raising Me you wouldn't recall for I'm not my former It's hard when you're stuck upon the shelf I changed by not changing at all Small town predicts my fate Perhaps that's what no one wants to seeWhat the fuck is this world running to You didn't leave a message At least I could have learned your voice one last time Daily minefield, this could be my time by you Would you hit me  Would you hit me Oh, oh-oh Oh, oh-oh, aw All the bills go by and initiatives are taken up By the middle; there ain't gonna be any middle anymore And the cross I'm bearing home ain't indicative of my place Left the porch, left the porch Oh, oh-oh Oh, oh-oh Hear my name, take a good look This could be the day Hold my hand, walk beside me I just need to say Oh, oh-oh Hear my name, take a good look This could be the day Hold my hand, lie beside me I just need to say
