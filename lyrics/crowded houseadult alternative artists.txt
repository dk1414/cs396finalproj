There is freedom within, there is freedom without Try to catch a deluge in a paper cup There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost But you'll never see the end of the road While you're traveling with me Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in They come, they come to build a wall between us We know they won't win Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof My possessions are causing me suspicion, but there's no proof In the paper today, tales of war and of waste But you turn right over to the T V page Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in They come, they come to build a wall between us We know they won't winWalking 'round the room singin' Stormy Weather At Fifty Seven Mount Pleasant Street Well it's the same room But everything's different You can fight the sleep But not the dream Things ain't cookin' in my kitchen Strange affliction wash over me Julius Caesar And the Roman Empire Couldn't conquer the blue sky Well, there's a small boat made of china It's going nowhere on the mantlepiece Well, do I lie like a lounge-room lizard Or do I sing like a bird released Everywhere you go Always take the weather with you Everywhere you go Always take the weather Everywhere you go You always take the weather with you Everywhere you go Always take the weather The weather with youI'm really close tonight And I feel like I'm moving inside her Lying in the dark And I think that I'm beginning to know her Let it go I'll be there when you call And whenever I fall at your feet You let your tears rain down on me Whenever I touch your slow turning pain You're hiding from me now There's something in the way that you're talking The words don't sound right But I hear them all moving inside you Know I'll be waiting when you call Hey, whenever I fall at your feet Won't you let your tears rain down on me Whenever I touch your slow turning painShe came all the way from America She had a blind date with destiny And the sound of Te Awamutu Had a truly sacred ring Now her parents Are divorced And her friend's committing suicide I could not escape A plea from the heart You know what it means to me You said don't walk away I'm down on my knees Well, please don't be mean to me So I talked to you for an hour In the bar of a small town hotel And you asked me what I was thinking I was thinking of a padded cell With a black and white T.V To stop us from getting lonely I could not escape A plea from the heart You know what it means to me You said don't walk away I'm down on my knees So please don't be mean to meSomewhere deep inside Something's got a hold on you And it's pushing me aside See it stretch on forever And I know I'm right For the first time in my life That's why I tell you You'd better be home soon Stripping back the coats Of lies and deceiption Back to nothingness Like a week in the desert And I know I'm right For the first time in my life That's why I tell you You'd better be home soon So don't say no, don't say nothing's wrong Cos when you get back home maybe I'll be gone When the nights go down When you've had your fill When there's nothing leftFour seasons in one day Lying in the depths of your imagination Worlds above and worlds below The sun shines on the black clouds hanging over the domain Even when you're feeling warm The temperature could drop away Like four seasons in one day Smiling as the shit comes down You can tell a man from what he has to say Everything gets turned around And I will risk my neck again, again You can take me where you will Up the creek and through the mill Like all the things you can't explain Four seasons in one day Blood dries up Like rain, like rain Fills my cup Like four seasons in one dayTell me all the things you would change I don't pretend to know what you want When you come around and spin my top Time and again, time and again No fire where I lit my spark I am not afraid of the dark Where your words devour my heart And put me to shame, put me to shame When your seven worlds collide Whenever I am by your side And dust from a distant sun Will shower over everyone You're still so young to travel so far Old enough to know who you are Wise enough to carry the scars Without any blame, there's no one to blame It's easy to forget what you learned Waiting for the thrill to return Feeling your desire burn You're drawn to the flameNot everyone in New York would pay to see Andrew Lloyd Webber May his trousers fall down as he bows to the queen and the crown I don't know what tune that the orchestra played But it went by me sickly and sentimental Can I have another piece of chocolate cake Tammy Bakker's got a lot on her plate Can I buy another cheap Picasso fake Andy Warhol must be laughing in his grave The band of the night takes you to ethereal heights over dinner And you wander the streets never reaching the heights that you seek And the sugar that dripped from the violin's bow Made the children go crazy, put a hole in the tooth of a hag Can I have another piece of chocolate cake Tammy Bakker must be losing her faith, yeah Can I buy another cheap Picasso fake Andy Warhol must be laughing in his grave And the dogs are on the road, we're all tempting fate Cars shooting by with no number plates And here comes Mrs  Hairy LegsWhen you come across the sea Me like a beacon, guiding you to safety The sooner the better now And when you come the hills will breathe Like a baby, pulled up Heaving from the bottom of the ocean The sooner the better now And when you come to cover me With your kisses, fresh like a daisy Chained up in a lion's den The sooner the better now I'll know you by the thunderclap Pouring like a rain of blood to my emotions And that is why, I stumble to my knees And why, underneath the Heavens With the stars burning and exploding I know why I could never let you down When you comeYou opened up your door I couldn't believe my luck You in your new blue dress Taking away my breath The cradle is soft and warm It couldn't do me no harm You're showing me how to give Into temptation Knowing full well, the Earth will rebel Into temptation A muddle of nervous words Could never amount to betrayal The sentence is all my own The price is to watch it fail As I turn to go You looked at me for half a second With an open invitation For me to go Into temptation Knowing full well, the Earth will rebel Into temptation Safe in the wide open arms of Hell
