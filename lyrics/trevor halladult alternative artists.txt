Mmh, yeah mmm Sun coming up on the earth Open up strong and we learn Never done, never do we waver Who is the one that we seek Who is the one within we I don't fear, I don't fear the answer I know hope, it has wings I can see a rest with the king Let it shine, let it shine unbounded Out of the mouth comes the water Out of the earth came a daughter All I hear, all I hear is to forgive..  give Forgive, forgive Out of the hands of creator I call out my heart day Lead us in, lead us into patience They drew the mist on the ceiling Let it rain down for our healing I know this, I know this is ancient Well, I love you and I mean it!Hey little child can you feel it Let it come, let it come full circle Giving up on separation Now it's time that we face it All I hear, all I hear is to forgive..  give Forgive, forgiveWell I say...Spread the wings of your butterfly I imply Color me in begin to bring the fantasy to life To avoid the confusion We're in an illusion How much poison can you swallow Flip the switch Pucker up and kiss Feed the inner child until it's full with bliss Well I say what you going to do when Dracula comes for you Stand there until you go hollow Mister Mister Can I get a 10-4 Do you agree that there's a monster at the front door Ready to bang it down Swallow up the town Put the children up for ransom And make himself a crown Mister Mister Do you agree That there's some one in this village that stole our apple seed The ocean's drying up Constellations are corrupt And all I can hear is this soundAll of my doors are open Got a full moon in that sky I’m leaving that darkness broken Blowing smoke rings out my mind Calling on all that’s wild Pages have been turned Gonna reach into my fire Gonna let that old way burn I ain’t afraid of shining I ain’t afraid of love I’m gonna stop denying This time i won’t run It’s all in perfect timing I’m crushing all my doubt Step into warrior status All things come back around I’m pulling back my arrow I’m shooting for the soul Standing strong like mountain I’m coming homeSpark a match and watch the candle burn The wick runs out and then love takes its turn On fallen angels and broken sounds We will last past the final round It took a while for you to find me But I was hiding in the lime tree Above the city in the rain cloud I poked a hole and watched it drain out Parallel to the city streets Our broken crowns beneath our feet But as we walk across the diamonds We know that love is always shining Save me love, save me all the time I'll wash you down with a simple sip of wine Toast my glass to all my loved ones To let them know that the stars, well they still shine It took a while for you to find me But I was hiding in the lime tree Above the city in the rain cloud I poked a hole and watched it drain outI greet my Lord down by the river side It hits me almost every time Beauty runs so deep that it's hard to sleep at night This is the chapter of the forest Every line and every chorus From my heart it comes, I pour it Into every single melody Flame without the smoke On this holy poetry I swear I'll never choke Because I only speak of Narmade Hara Hara everyday Lay my love down at her waters Calling on the mountain's daughter No more books, no more empty words No more running away from her I now learn from the wind and rain From the song of the lion's mane And as he tosses and sun and moon I sit back and behold that tomb All glory upon Her name We say Hara Hara Hara Narmade Hara Hara Hara NarmadeHe said black like obsidian Land of the Indian Sound out the call This is Mother's dominion Bird of the thunder We don't go under We sing loud We don't care for opinion Oh, sky horses Ancestor forces I hear the language I hear the language Deep Wake from your sleep Swallow up the message And tell me what you see I see constellations burning All the worlds, they are turning But the music is my fortress See I heard it in a chorus Last night I saw a blazing stallion Running through the fields of Babylon His dark mane on fire Singing of a spiritual empireAs I walk on down, I feel like a clown In a circus of my own Oh, my cover is blown Feel like I got a heart made of tin I thought of you this morning Well I sleep into a state As I awake Well I start to find That I can't get your smoke out of my eyes I guess I lose, I guess you win I thought of you this morning Well, I think about all the other ways I could've played All the other simple moves I could've made All the other cards that I could've dealt All the books I didn't read upon my shelf All the other ways I could've sung my songs I've realized that none of it went wrong It was all play, how could it be any other way How could it be any other way Now that the chains are off, I'm free to roam Everywhere I go, I feel like I'm home Nothing hides, everything is shown She is always with me, I'm never alone I guess you lose, I guess I win I thought of you this morningI can hear it calling through the thunder back to my god The sound, the healer, I can feel her, this is my god She told me within the man, another man, this is my god Forever falling to the calling, that is my god Don't put your guns upon my way, this is my god The rhythm speaking, don't be sleeping, this is my god A fire burn, watch it turn, this is my god From Mother back to Mother, this is my god This is my god I can hear it calling through the thunder back to my god The sound, the healer, I can feel her, this is my god She told me within the man, another man, this is my god Forever falling to the calling, that is my god The calling, that is my god The calling, that is my god Calling, that is my god Calling, that is my godEverything passing and changing I can see memories fading This i have been contemplating All of these patterns of weather Nothing is lasting forever Walking the path of surrender So i have been patiently seeking The heart that is openly beating Where all of those rivers are meeting I have the faith that i’m guided All of the omens aligning Mother Divine in Her timing So watch it come now and watch it go Don’t you hold onto the high and low The spirit dancing on the unknown Let it move your soul What lies ahead now what lies behind Put all that worry out of your mind Look in your own home What will you find Let it move your soulThe myth of Ulalena Of that ocean song Eyes of white pueo See the one in all The more I lose my words The more I'm coming home Let the mind grow humble Let that spirit roam Thread it through the thunder Let the sky mouth sing Through the black light rainbow Mother spoke to me Don't you carry stones Don't you carry stones Don't you carry stones Don't you carry stones Don't you carry stones Don't you carry stones in your bowl of light In your bowl of light In your bowl of light In your bowl of light Where we drove upcountry Our feet stained in the rain Laid some good, good prayers down She said, "I see you child, I see you there."We forget and remember And we forget again But this life is a circle And it's coming back around It's coming back again
