And I'd give up forever to touch you'Cause I know that you feel me somehow You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be And I don't wanna go home right now And all I could taste is this moment And all I can breathe is your life And sooner or later, it's over I just don't wanna miss you tonight And I don't want the world to see me'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming Or the moment of truth in your lies When everything feels like the movies Yeah, you bleed just to know you're aliveBaby's black balloon makes her fly I almost fell into that hole in your life And you're not thinking about tomorrow'Cause you were the same as me But on your knees A thousand other boys could never reach you How could I have been the one I saw the world spin beneath you And scatter like ice from the spoon That was your womb Comin' down the world turned over And angels fall without you there And I go on as you get colder Or are you someone's prayer You know the lies they always told you And the love you never knew What's the things they never showed you That swallow the light from the sun Inside your room, yeahAnd even though the moment passed me by I still can't turn away'Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose Get tossed along the way And letters that you never meant to send Get lost or thrown away And now we're grown-up orphans That never knew their names We don't belong to no one, that's a shame You could hide beside me Maybe for a while And I won't tell no one your name And I won't tell 'em your name And scars are souvenirs you never lose The past is never far And did you lose yourself somewhere out there Did you get to be a star And don't it make you sad to know that life Is more than who we are You grew up way too fast And now there's nothing to believe Then reruns all become our history A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio And I won't tell no one your name And I won't tell 'em your nameCould you whisper in my ear The things you wanna feel I'd give you anything To feel it comin'Do you wake up on your own Or wonder where you are And live with all your faults I wanna wake up where you are I won't say anything at all So why don't you slide Yeah, we're gonna let it slide Don't you love the life you killed The priest is on the phone Your father hit the wall Your ma disowned you I don't suppose I'll ever know What it means to be a man Or something I can just change I live around it I wanna wake up where you are I won't say anything at all So why don't you slide Ooh, slideStranger than your sympathy And this is my apology I killed myself from the inside out And all my fears have pushed you out And I wished for things that i don't need And what I chased won't set me free And I get scared but I'm not crawling on my knees Oh, yeah Everything's all wrong, yeah Everything's all wrong, yeah Where the hell did I think I was And stranger than your sympathy Take these things, so I don't feel I'm killing myself from the inside out And now my head's been filled with doubt We're taught to lead the life you choose When all your luck's run out on you And you can't see when all your dreams are coming true Oh, yeah It's easy to forget, yeah When you choke on the regrets, yeah Who the hell did I think I was You and i got something But it's all and then it's nothing to me, yeah And i got my defenses When it comes through your intentions for me, yeah And we wake up in the breakdown With the things we never thought we could be, yeah I'm not the one who broke you I'm not the one you should fear We got to move you darling I thought i lost you somewhere But you were never really ever there at all And i want to get free Talk to me I can feel you falling And i wanted to be All you need Somehow here is gone I am no solution To the sound of this pollution in me, yeah And i was not the answer So forget you ever thought it was me, yeahBroadway's dark tonight A little bit weaker than you used to be Broadway's dark tonight See the young man sitting in the old man's bar Waiting for his turn to die The cowboy kills the rock star And Friday night's gone too far The dim light hides the years On all the faded girls Forgotten but not gone You drink it off your mind You talk about the world like it's someplace that you've been You see, you'd love to run home, but you know you ain't got one Cause you're living in a world that you're best forgotten, around here Broadway's dark tonight A little bit weaker than you used to be Broadway's dark tonight See the young man sitting in the old man's bar Waiting for his turn to dieI wander through fiction to look for the truth Buried beneath all the lies And I stood at a distance To feel who you are Hiding myself in your eyes And hold on before it's too late We'll run till we leave this behind Don't fall just be who you are It's all that we need in our lives And the risk that might break you Is the one that would save A life you don't live is still lost So stand on the edge with me Hold back your fear and see Nothing is real 'til it's gone So live like you mean it Love 'til you feel it It's all that we need in our lives So stand on the edge with me Hold back your fear and see Nothing is real 'til it's goneYou wait, wanting this world To let you in And you stand there A frozen light In dark and empty streets You smile hiding behind A God-given face But I know you're so much more Everything they ignore Is all that I need to see You're the only one I ever believed in The answer that could never be found The moment you decided to let love in Now I'm banging on the door of an angel The end of fear is where we begin The moment we decided to let love in I wish Wishing for you to find your way And I'll hold on for all you need That's all we need to say I'll take my chances while You take your time with This game you play But I can't control your soul You need to let me know You leaving or you going to stayCould you whisper in my ear The things you wanna feel I'd give you anything To feel it comin'Do you wake up on your own And wonder where you are You live with all your faults I wanna wake up where you are I won't say anything at all So why don't you slide Yeah, I'm gonna let it slide Don't you love the life you killed The priest is on the phone Your father hit the wall Your ma disowned you I don't suppose I'll ever know What it means to be a man It's something I can't change I'll live around it
