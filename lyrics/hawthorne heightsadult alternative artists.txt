Hey, there I know it's hard to feel like I don't care at all Where you are and how you feel With these lights off as these wheels Keep rolling on and on and on and on and on Slow things down or speed them up Not enough or way too much And on and on and on, how are you when I'm gone And I can't make it on my own Because my heart is in Ohio So cut my wrists and black my eyes So I can fall asleep tonight, or die Because you kill me You know you do, you kill me well You like it too, and I can tell You'll never stop until my final breath is gone Spare me just three last words, "I love you" is all she heard I'll wait for you, but I can't wait forever Spare me just three last words, "I love you" is all she heard I'll wait for you, but I can't wait foreverLet's go down now into the darkness of your thoughts Hurry up now, we're waiting for us to fall I fall to pieces now, a broken mirror in your life The silence in black and white Falling forward as she walks towards the light I know!I'm outside of your window with my radio I sleep with one eye open so I can see you breathing I follow your chest home until I I can see you, I can hear you breathe in, exhale The silence in black and white I know!I'm outside of your window with my radio I know!I'm outside of your window with my radio Know!Know These colors will not change You change the way I see them These words will fade When you explain why you hate them We are the same She keeps repeating All that she needed She says she's right here She seems so distant Saying goodbye this time, the same old story Seeing you cry, makes me feel like saying sorry Just a few last hours, we gotta make this count We're counting backwards Just a few last hours, we gotta make this count We're falling forwards She keeps repeating All that she needed She says she's right here She seems so distantBetween the future and the past tense Lies the present and the distance So you think we're never coming back Scoring points for passion and persistence Between the lines on the highway Lies the danger and the safety You never thought this was gonna last I always knew you'd never take it back I always knew… I know it seems like we're never coming back I know it feels like we're never coming back You tried your best and you knew it wouldn't last They were the words that she placed on her casket I know it seems like we're never coming back I know it feels like we're never coming back You tried your best and you knew it wouldn't last They were the words that she placed on her casket Between the sadness and the smile Lies the flicker of the fire You always said this never hurt you I always said you were a liar With all the towers and the wires There still lies a little silence Two hearts and one connection One voice lacks emotion now I always knew… I miss you most on winter mornings As we drift, we sleep through evenings, oh We drive into the cold and dark with fingers crossed I follow your eyes to avoid from getting lost And all I had was the memory of what was So let's pretend it never mattered to us I hope this message finds you well Never thought I'd live to tell Just to survive we do what we can We read the maps and signs And we make the plans By our design I write it down To get me by The worst time in my life And all I had was the memory of what was So let's pretend it never mattered to us I hope this message finds you well Never thought I'd live to tell What's a dream and what is real The way I really feelThe distance and my heart's to sand Flowing through the hourglass Time to let go of all we know Break our hearts in stride I need you now more like yesterday The last day I could see you smile For the last time turn out the lights My life on standby So standby and watch this fall away and fall apart Just say that it's over It's over and she's gone Now she's gone“Don't worry”, he said And she's not coming home She's not coming home It's over and she's gone The distance and my heart's to sand Flowing through the hourglass I fall to pieces I can't let go of all the times I never said goodbye I saw the glimmer of a silhouette The part of me that died had just come back Empty visions in a parking lot I spent my whole life lying, I just got caught Cold and dark by the riverside I search for answers at night I’ve got nowhere to hide I’ve got bruises beneath these ripped up jeans, I’m tired of this old life Where were you when I needed you the most When it got dark and I got cold You were never there when I got home The streetlights sing just like a curse You only seem to make things worse Now it’s getting hard to breathe The streetlights sing me fast asleep I spent my summers catching fireflies The part that flickered bright had just now died My innocence stopped making sense I’ve got no place left to hide Where were you when I needed you the most When it got dark and I got cold You were never there when I got home The streetlights sing just like a curse You only seem to make things worse Now it’s getting hard to breathe The streetlights sing me fast asleepOver and over You keep singing the same old song I used to be stronger, the silence is longer Now I'm the bitter one I've made mistakes And I'll take it all back I feel, I feel so typical Just another ghost From so so long ago Another faint reminder I still need you, do you need me Can you see right through me now Or should I just let go I'm just another ghost Again and again I keep having the same nightmare I used to be younger, I'm losing the hunger Not having any funSo here we are, back to the start again Trying hard to wait ‘til morning Hey, rise and shine and open up your eyes To give this world some color Shine on, diamond eyes Separate the space between love and lies And as days go by, the memories remain I'll wait for you And as days go by, the memories remain I won't let go These days remain the same Pictures fade away Please, don't ever change Please, don't change your mind No matter what they say, I'll always wait And as days go by, the memories remain I'll wait for you And as days go by, the memories remain I won't let goBleed these colors open wide Burning blues from butterflies Tonight we, tonight we fly Flying faster through the night Until the orange of morning light Dear black goodbye, dear black goodbye I know it's hard to make this work when you're all alone And I've been waiting for so long to hold you in my arms Embrace forever my sweet girl Water fills these open eyes Tonight we fly Still frames and valentines Won't keep me in her mind Dear black goodbye, dear black goodbye I know it's hard to make this work when you're all alone And I've been waiting for so long to hold you in my arms Embrace forever my sweet girl And I've been waiting for so long to hold you in my arms Embrace forever my sweet girl
