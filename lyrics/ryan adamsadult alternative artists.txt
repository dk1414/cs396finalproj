It's so hard to be without you Lying in the bed, you are so much to be without Rattles in my head that empty drum filled with doubt Everything you lose, the wisdom will find its way out Every night is lonesome and is longer than before Nothing really matters anymore It's so hard to be without you Used to feel so angry, and now I only feel humble Stinging from the storm inside my ribs where it thunders Nothing left to say or really even wonder We are like a book and every page is so torn Nothing really matters anymore It's so hard not to call you Thunders in my bones out in the streets where I first saw you When everything was new and colorful, it's gotten darker Every day's a lesson, things were brighter before Nothing really matters anymore It's so hard to be without you Everyday I find another little thread of silver Waiting for me when I wake some place on the pillow And then I see the empty space beside me and remember I feel empty, I feel tired, I feel worn Nothing really matters anymoreFree my heart Somebody locked it up Still waiting on parole I can taste the freedom just outside that door Same grey walls Same grey clothes Mmm, I know my friends all know Can't keep it under control I know our love is wrong I am a criminal Mmm, I am a prisoner Mmm, I am a prisoner For your love There's this one bird Lands on the sill beside the bars How can something born with wings Ever know freedom to truly be free Clock don't know what your memories do They're stacking up beside the bed I count 'em every night inside my headWhen they call your name, will you walk right up With a smile on your face Will you cower in fear in your favorite sweater With an old love letter I wish you would I wish you would Come pick me up, take me out Fuck me up, steal my records Screw all my friends, they're all full of shit With a smile on your face, and then do it again I wish you would When you're walking down town, do you wish I was there Do you wish it was me With the windows clear, and the mannequins' eyes Do they all look like mine You know you could I wish you wouldI been thinking about you, baby Been on my mind Why can't I feel your love Heart must be blind What can I say I didn't want it to change But in my mind, it's all so strange Do you still love me, babe Do you still love me, babe Do you still love me  Oh-oh Another year will pass I will count the days Another sun goes down And I'll never see the rays What can I say I didn't want it to change Is my heart blind and our love so strange Do you still love me, babe Do you still love me, babe Do you still love me  Oh-ohI went down to Houston and I stopped in San Antone I passed up the station for the bus I was trying to find me something But I wasn't sure just what Man I ended up with pockets full of dust So I went on to Cleveland and I ended up insane I bought a borrowed suit and learned to dance And I was spending money like the way it likes to rain Man I ended up with pockets full of cane Oh my sweet Carolina What compels me to go Oh my sweet disposition May you one day carry me home I ain't never been to Vegas but I gambled up my life Building newsprint boats I race to sewer mains Trying to find me something but I wasn't sure just what Funny how they say that some things never change Oh my sweet Carolina What compels me to go Oh my sweet disposition May you one day carry me homeMidnight coming, I can feel it in the air I hear your voice, run your fingers through my hair I reach out for your hand but I know it isn't there I pick up my phone and I shiver and I stare Morning coming early every day I can barely sleep, I been lying here awake I close my eyes, I see you with some guy Laughing like you never even knew I was alive Maybe I'm a fool, doesn't matter anyway My chest is all tight, my heart still aches These are the days you need double what it takes I've missed you so much I shiver and I shake I've missed you so much I shiver and I shake I've been waiting here like a dog at the door You used to throw me scraps, you donâ€™t do that anymore I miss your loving touch, I miss your embrace But if I wait here any longer I'm gonna fade away If I wait here any longer I'll just fade awayIt's so hard to be without you Lying in the bed, you are so much to be without Rattles in my head that empty drum filled with doubt Everything you lose, the wisdom will find its way out
