you for teaching me Yes, I thank you for your hurting I bite down a little harder, my blade's a little sharper My roots, my roots run deep into the hollow Strike back a little harder, I scream a little louder My roots, my roots run deep into the hollow I'm stronger than I ever knew, I'm strong because of you I hit back a little louder, fuck you a little harder My roots, my roots run deep into the hollow I thank you for the hole you dug in me Filled it with cement, sunk me in your sea Thank you for being so obscene I thank you  for never facing me Swimming in the mud, never coming clean I

your judgments that you placed on me was a reflection of discovery So maybe next time when you cast your stones From the shadows of the dark unknown You will crawl up from your hiding place And take a look in the mirror, see the truth in your faceI hate you for the sacrifices you made for me I hate you for every time you ever bled for me I hate you for the way you smile when you look at me I hate
