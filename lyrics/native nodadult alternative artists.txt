I rationalise my shaking legs and feet As a constant rhythm flowing through my head But that doesn't explain my tight neck and oily pores on my back My spine is clearly pleading for release No, it's not just a song It's definitely not just a song It's a beat and it's racing past your pad, through your pad At light speed, rendering everything in its path obsolete It's a beat and it's racing past your pad, through your pad At light speed, rendering everything in its path obsolete Cut the cord that strangles your head Cut the cord that strangles your head Cut the cord that strangles your head Feed me bread Cut the cord that strangles your head Cut the cord that strangles your head Cut the cord that strangles your head Feed me bread Cut the cord that strangles your head Cut the cord that strangles your head Feed me breadThe Aleutian lies Decaying and decrepit At the bottom of the Bering Strait The force of the waves was too much for its walls But the captain cried for more"Another eighty thousand pounds more""C'mon, bring it on"Maday, maday Maday, maday Maday, maday Maday, maday Bring on another eighty thousand pounds to our already full load So I can watch them make one final gasp at freedom before we tear those motherfuckers apart Maday, maday Maday, maday Maday, maday Maday, maday As the ship sank to the bottom The attack took nine unexpected Nine human lives Nine human lives With a small price to pay Thousands slaughtered daily by the very handMorning breaks After a long, hot summer night Spent on the cabin floor Spoiling the sacred peace The sun filters through the windows Like swords ripping through his flesh In a frenzy, he vainly attempts to hold back the demons Holding him back But perhaps it's too late For his friends have already fled the cabin Leaving him little time to react For he hears children's voices On the hills, in the forest, approaching quickly, quickly So he answers He answers as he's done before And he'll do forever His discomfort soon wears off His discomfort soon wears off His discomfort—Upon, the realization—Upon, the realization—This can't exist This can't exist This can't exist This can't exist This can't exist This can't exist This can't exist This can't existI try to organize What's going on in my head But after awhile it seems like I'm Back where I started again We got stuck in this web And we made it ourselves And we've rolled around in this sticky web Because we don't care And we can't break free I'm not saying I know the answers Besides it's not up to me But I could point out a thousand examples To show their backwards mentality They give us simple answers So they can stay where they are And they're appealing to the masses Who can only see just that far And we're still building these webs Around ones already existing I'm trying to cut myself loose But I can't organize my head The puzzle's too big It's all around me And they can deny.. I see no stability in history Since we're finding lies upon lies upon lies Yet you base your life on inconsistencies None of which have any backings provable I'm not saying it's bunk to learn What we believe happened before Because they've all agreed upon the lie And it's probably somewhere near the truth But I'd much rather base my life Around anything that's here before my eyes Anything that's tangible Anything that's a definite fact Resting on the laws of physics Everything we need to know To solve our problems Is here Somewhere Around us Somewhere around us Somewhere definite Something that we say we know Based on science And not historyThe hallways at the prep The house of mirrors We laugh at them because Well I don't know why Hahaha Chime the giddy freshman As I come in only to take the attendance Hahaha Sings the photo of the skateboarder Above the dean of men's office My aunt my own blood was in hysterics As she tried to find the underground Through silicone and twenty-five year old boyfriends Hahaha She laughed all the way to the ticket booth And I couldn't bring myself to laugh at her When she got out So what am I supposed to sayCrammed in a space Less than six feet by two feet Like veal ready for slaughter He lies there Unable to move The walls binding him in his place Are the flesh of the men around him No room to even sit up Iron clamps bind him to his partner No bathroom in sight He's forced to relieve himself Right where he lies Contributing to the unbearable stench So foul that any man unaccustomed to it Would surely pass out No mats No sheets He lies there on the splintering wood And on a stormy night His flesh would be shed down To the bare bone Oozing puss and blood Onto the already excrement filled floor Any thoughts of mutiny That may have crossed his brain quickly fade As he views a fellow uncooperative slave Flogged to near death with a cat of nine tailsMy back is bleeding From what they don't know Except that something in my intestines exploded I spent five days in the hospital With tubes up my ass and down my throat Ingesting chemicals that made me choke In I.C  I saw an infant ran over by a car Lying next to me is a boy they say is surely gonna die The teenage mother with asthma Runs up and down the hallway Waiting for her flake of a boyfriend to call While I lie in bed and bleed The screams of the girl With down syndrome and cancer Echo through my brain As I complain about the stench of my bleed Every attempt at friendship I've made with the boy with sickle cell Has fallen flat on my face But then again I'm just bleeding Why am I crying I rationalise my shaking legs and feet As a constant rhythm flowing through my head But that doesn't explain my tight neck and oily pores on my back My spine is clearly pleading for release No, it's not just a song It's definitely not just a song It's a beat and it's racing past your pad, through your pad At light speed, rendering everything in its path obsolete It's a beat and it's racing past your pad, through your pad At light speed, rendering everything in its path obsolete Cut the cord that strangles your head Cut the cord that strangles your head Cut the cord that strangles your head Feed me bread Cut the cord that strangles your head Cut the cord that strangles your head Cut the cord that strangles your head Feed me bread Cut the cord that strangles your head Cut the cord that strangles your head Feed me breadThe Aleutian lies Decaying and decrepit At the bottom of the Bering Strait The force of the waves was too much for its walls But the captain cried for more"Another eighty thousand pounds more""C'mon, bring it on"Maday, maday Maday, maday Maday, maday Maday, maday Bring on another eighty thousand pounds to our already full load So I can watch them make one final gasp at freedom before we tear those motherfuckers apart Maday, maday Maday, maday Maday, maday Maday, maday As the ship sank to the bottom The attack took nine unexpected Nine human lives Nine human lives With a small price to pay Thousands slaughtered daily by the very hand
