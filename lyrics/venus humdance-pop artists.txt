Do you want to fight me With your one good leg And do you think you can beat me Why don't you wait until you get out of bed Well, you're throwing frantic punches at the rate of snow If you'd break in half then you could let it go You're eighty pounds of wreckage in a mason jar You're a bit combustible, don't break So you want to fight me With your one good eye And do you think you can beat me Hm  Well, come on, come on Well, you're holding back the candy like a one-year-old If you'd break in half then you could let it go You're eighty pounds of wreckage in a mason jar You're a bit combustible, don't break Something wicked this way comes Is it God's or is it yours It's a bit uncomfortable Oh, don't kill the messengerThe words of wordless May Sing a song to me She stands as tall as trees these days The words of wordless May Dear Jesus make me simple Strong as trees to sway Give me arms wide open With a beautiful way Just like wordless May If there were fields as pretty as you I'd want to kiss them too If there were fields as pretty as you I'd want to kiss them too If there were eyes so pretty and blue I'd want to swim them too If there were skies as pretty as you I'd want to kiss them too The words of wordless May Sing a song to me She stands as tall as trees these days The words of wordless May Dear Jesus make me simple Strong as trees to sway Give me arms wide open With a

Yes yes yes Yes Yes...Something has to come out Is it words is it notes Must it come from my mouthI am beautiful Strong and able My hands, my face Do what I say My legs obey Make you kick up a tune I have weakness up my sleeve A red dress for lying And a blue dress for peace Amazing How soft  How still Underneath Hold me I keep my heart In a box on the wall Behind my Mona Lisa I am smiling I am fighting for love I am fighting for love My created shell Steel is too hard Even I cannot break it You can bring, black or red When you're inside me And I melt into you All torn in two Me and my somebody else Wear a green dress for growingGreen gum Lips so pink Hot neon pen Flash forward take a picture of me I'm the prize at the end Ah!Swim the rainbow Drown in paint and sky I meet my melody Feeling she's Fascinating I'm Super Loud like Sonic Boom!Like racing trains!Like bells at noon!I'm super loud like a sonic boom!Like a racing train!Like bells at noon Sound, suck it eyes Come on happy feet Tingling my fingertips Stolen from the tree I can hear, this is sound Through a hole, in the roof I can swim, salty air Feel the sand, in my shoes Wait just a minute now I am leaving Who will come Throw the desk out the window Put on my rocket shoes Fold my tie Smack the door down and break through the window Sick sucking energy Sunday afternoon Think I have 'bout two drops left Glistening on the spoon I can hear, jingle signs Since three years, to the five I can swim, with the whales If I leave here alon–µSorry, golden love motive, groping surrounded, rushing through trees Darling,
