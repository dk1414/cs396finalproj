You see it all around you Good loving gone bad And usually it's too late when you Realize what you had And my mind goes back To a girl I met some years ago Who told me Just hold on loosely, but don't let go If you cling too tightly You're gonna lose control Your baby needs someone to believe in And a whole lot of space to breathe in So damn easy When your feelings are such To overprotect her To love her too much And my mind goes back To a girl I met some years ago Who told meI never knew there'd come a day When I'd be sayin' to you"Don't let this good love slip away Now that we know that it's true."Don't, don't you know the kind of man I am No, said I'd never fall in love again But it's real, and the feeling comes shining through I'm so caught up in you, little girl And I never did suspect a thing So caught up in you, little girl That I never wanna get myself free And baby, it's true, you're the one Who caught me, baby, you taught me How good it could be It took so long to change my mind I thought that love was a game I played around enough to find No two are ever the sameJust when I thought I finally learned my lesson well There was more to this than meets the eye And for all the things you taught me, only time will tell If I'll be able to survive, oh yeah Teacher, teacher, can you teach me Can you tell me all I need to know Teacher, teacher, can you reach me Or will I fall when you let me go  Oh no Am I ready for the real world  Will I pass the test You know it's a jungle out there Ain't nothin' gonna stop me, I won't be second best But the joke's on those who believe the system's fair, oh yeah Teacher, teacher, can you teach me Can you tell me if I'm right or wrong Teacher, teacher, can you reach me I wanna know what's goin' on, oh yeah So the years go on and on, but nothing's lost or won And what you learn is soon forgotten They take the best years of your life Try to tell you wrong from right But you walk away with nothing, oh, ohIt's a hot night at the juke joint And the band's pumpin' rhythm and blues Gonna spill a little rock and roll blood tonight Gonna make some front page news And the ladies hate the violence Still they never seem to look away'Cause they love those Wild eyed southern boys Wild eyed boys Wild eyed southern boys It's a southern point of honor You gotta get right in on the action You can hear the outlaws holler Fightin' for the lady in black And she's just one in a million But she's all I need tonightI've been lost inside, empty space in my heart And some things never change, oh How it hurts me and how it's tearin' me apart And it just goes on and on Can you read my mind Take a good look at my face Could you take the time Just to stand here in my place What if I'd been the one to say goodbye, goodbye Could you smile when inside you just wanna cry, look inside Can you read my mind  Oh, oh When I hear your name Feel so cold deep inside Still it's hard to explain, oh What your love meant to me They say time will heal the pain But it just goes on forever Can you read my mind Have you closed the door on love Can you be so blind Did you think I'd just give upOoh, rockin'Oh yeah Cruisin' down the motorway Got my girl by my side We're both a little anxious Ooh, we got love on our mind Waitin', anticipatin'For the fireworks in the night Well, I swear we were doin' eighty When we saw those motel lights And we were rockin' into the night Rockin' into the night Ooh hoo, rockin'Rockin' into the night Rockin' into the night Yeah...Out on the back streets Taking love where I can I found a sweet madonna Ooh, with a bible in her handYou see it all around you Good loving gone bad And usually it's too late when you Realize what you had And my mind goes back To a girl I met some years ago Who
