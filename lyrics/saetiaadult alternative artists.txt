 Close my eyes, pull my heart strings Pour my tears from your hands Connections are never easy, you said Empty words, empty soul I believe that we are afraid of one another And I believe that you have died within me I fade from myself, I miss you again I fade from myself, I miss you again, again What have we got What have we got Bloody, broken and hidden away I seek the rope from which we will hang Or so it seems Or so it seems The dance of flesh on flesh has rendered us blind I look into your eyes, I look into stone It's better to be stepped on than left all alone It's better to be stepped on than left all alone Alone Now I choke on yesterday When I was someone and I wonder where forever went And how our everything came undone I opened my eyes And beneath us the heavens diedLost gray pictures of my past, stain greener pastures of my future Rememberance and recognition forces me to reconsider I am seeking to regress and recreating what I've found A new beginning torn away, I'm spiraling, spiraling down Empty hands on the ends of these reaching arms Need the touch of something real Year by year we seperate further We are forgetting how to feel, ah!For at the end of this long rope I hang in wait of fading echos Uncertainty haunts my everything I look into tomorrow and I see N OT HI NG!So tell me how it feels to be me I've lost so much I cannot recall my identity I would die for yesterday not caring where I need to go Reshape relationships back into what I used to know Tomorrow is so far and I no longer want to find A replacement for all these pictures that are lost in my mindPetals blown from closed hands, by quiet breath Reason defines us, beauty carries us, recognition makes us Every thread well placed, every aperture leaks Dream of the coming on, fail to realize We cannot carry that which we cannot acquire Oh we have lost what we longed for The feeling in my arms, my embrace That which you have dropped This canon is complete We need this Touch me deeply as you once had And I will not soon forget it We speak in riddles to deny the past To love the present, to prepare the future Beyond that which we have more of I have seen an old glimmer It's starry eyes for empty skies, I tell you I shudder so hard to find An embrace so hard to maintain I sweat pictures, words Hours of days gone Once buried And the corpses now warm to the touch  These dialogue stars dream of Sundays in October These dialogue stars dream of Sundays in October These dialogue stars dream of Sundays in October Perception keeps us whole and it may just be time To look rather than, rather than merely see These testaments to divine light Years of work glare back at us Out from oil, out from marble Out from sound And sublimity, seeking sanctuary In the written word, in the written word To make the inspiration Visible, audible, touchable To make the inspiration Visible, audible, touchable To make the inspiration Visible, audible, touchable To make the inspiration Visible, audible, touchable To create a world from dust That is what it means to be Our own deitiesI bleed onto a page for you where diction has lost all its meaning And secrets fall from lips like dying petals in a forgotten garden Believing Believing Believing Believing language, we speak In tongues, deceiving ourselves My heart whispers In forms that twenty years Of reason and cognition Have rendered useless If only you could hear what I have seen for aeons Before this zero To see our system as a void To believe ourselves immune To never feel our wings melting We are all spirits trapped and dying Trapped and dyingOh, what new languages may come As the hands of fate The hands of fate are kissed Tranquil taking of a heart In love's silhouetted garden The otherness The otherness of words Our new times Are the worst ties Because the softest lips tell the most precious secrets Forget the broken backed stretch across a painted background You've never experienced Forget the lazy days of daydream departure to faraway laughs You've never heard Forget the backwards walk through liminal windows You never knew existed You never knew existed You never knew existed You never knew existed You never knew existed Forget the bells tolling an hour of redemption, a minute of fancy You've never been given Forget the love letters penned by sad faced boys You've never met Forget the unwritten, uncollected works of the poet You never wereSmiled that kind of icy blue smile Of a noonday reckoning The tied together two of tell-tale pictures I've sketched in sandcastle plots and plans Similar starting points Both for sin and shooting blanks But it's always the unseen sharp pang The awkward rhythm of the dance Like a tick-tock clock in that heart of hearts Repeating There is no happy here, there is no happy here There is no happy here, there is no happy here There is no happy here, there is no happy here There is no happy here, there is no happy here Devil may care touches Trickled down Spine, thigh, and breast Spine, thigh, and breast Spine, thigh, and breast Spine, thigh, and breast May never Truly illuminate Illuminate the finer art of heartworkIt is almost like we've died Entwined in that way we are Entwined in that way we are And our voices, our touch, our lips Are searching For answers to questions not asked It is not A belief in dreams It is not A refusal to accept It is A refusal to let go And words written Over time only serve to paint these days A clearer shade of black Now a dying wave on a shallow sea Now a dying wave on a shallow sea, sea, sea, sea Sea, sea, sea, see Our lives fade apart to converge Only in my darker hours, only in my saddest hours Take these words pulled from me Tied to you"It's not you...It's just the fact that lives come together They fade apart...It's just the fact that lives come together They fade apart As shadows are cast, yet numbed by the light These are our beings..."This is what you told me But I remember yesterday And I believe and I feel and I want And empty is not friendly...Cracked mortar --Lies --And pure remnants of an unsure bond Perhaps we trust too much in this invisible thread to move on...Flowers only live so long When they grow out of three small words"I only speak when spoken to;I thought you knew this And I am sorry."Next time I will be careful what I wish for Next time I will be careful what I wish forShe died long before that day I know this Tortured, grieving heart of mother no longer knew her own being And as the sun set on another You fell through dying dreams, but could not catch them And I could not catch you Hiding below my shadow Yet dancing above my fears I grip sorrow's edge As you crumble to fall at my soul's tears I have not forgotten you But sometimes I can't help feeling numb Feeling numb through and through Closed hands on open arms hold nothing Closed hands on open arms hold nothing Closed hands on open arms hold nothing Closed hands on open arms hold nothing Hold nothing, hold nothing, hold nothing, hold nothing Closed hands on open arms hold nothing
