hold you It's you and me foreverMy friends wonder why I call you all the time, what can I say I don't feel the need to give such secrets away You think maybe I need help, though I know I'm right, alright I'm just better off not listening to friends' advice When they insist on knowing my bliss I tell them this When they wanna know what the reason is I only smile when I lie, then I tell them why Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light I go crazy wonderin' what there is to really see Did the night just take up your time 'cause it means more to me Sometimes I forget what I'm doing, I don't forget what I want, what I want Regret what I've done, regret you  I couldn't go onMidnight hour almost over Time is running out for the magic pair I know you gave the best that you have But one more chance Couldn't be all that hard to bear Wait for me, please Wait for me, oh I guess that's more than I should ask But won't you wait for me Please, wait for me Although I know the light is fading fast You could go either way Is it easier to stay I wonder what you'll do When your chance rolls around But you gotta know how much I want to keep you When I'm away I'm afraid it will all fall down So wait for me, please Wait for me, alright AI guess that's more than I should ask But won't you wait for me Although I know the light is fading fast
