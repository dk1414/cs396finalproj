Oh yeah, aw What we're livin' in Let me tell ya Yeah, it's a wonder man can eat at all When things are big that should be small Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doin' for us And I'm givin' all my love to this world Only to be told I can't see, I can't breathe No more will we be And nothin's going to change the way we live'Cause we can always take, but never give And now that things are changing for the worse, see Woah, it's a crazy world we're livin' in And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin Is all we have to give these Futures made of virtual insanity Now always seem to be governed by this love we have For useless twisting of our new technology Oh, now there is no sound For we all live undergroundYou pick me up, then you put me down Can't seem to find my way around ya See what you think, when you don't think it now You lost my love but someone found it Now when the rain falls upon my head I don't think of you that much at all Just one thing seemed to make you care Who's gonna drive and take you home Only a fool could walk away from me this time I look up to Heaven, every star I see is mine Only a fool could walk away from me this time I'm walking on air, and every cloud is cloud 9 You get your kicks playing stupid tricks But I've found another crush, You got me now Game, set and match, don't seem to be no catch I don't think she'll drive me to the wall We go out at night, and the world starts feeling right She don't care about Hollywood I know you don't believe it, but this time I really mean it I hope it's clearly understoodYou know this boogie is for real I used to put my faith in worship But then my chance to get to Heaven slipped I used to worry about the future But then I threw my caution to the wind I had no reason to be carefree - no, no, no'Til I took a trip to the other side of town - yeah, yeah, yeah You know I heard that boogie rhythm Hey  I had no choice but to get down, down, down, down Dance!Nothing left for me to do but dance Off these bad times I'm going through, just dance Got canned heat in my heels, tonight, baby I feel the thunder, see the lightning I know this anger's Heaven-sent So I've got to hang out all my hang-ups'Cause of the boogie, I feel so Hell-bent, hey, hey It's just an instant gut reaction, that I got I know I've never, ever felt like this before I don't know what to do But then that's nothing new Stuck between Hell and high water, need a cure to make it through, hey The pebbles you've arranged In the sand, they're strange They speak to me like constellations as we lie here There's a magic I can't hold Your smile of honey gold In that you never seem to be in short supply of Ooh, so baby, let's get it on Drinking wine and killing time Sitting in the summer sun You know I've wanted you so long Why'd you have to drop that bomb on me Lazy days, crazy dolls You said we'd been friends too long Seven days in sunny June Were long enough to bloom The flowers on the summer dress you wore in spring The way we laughed as one And then you dropped the bomb That I've known you too long for us to have a thingI must've died and gone to heaven'Cause it was a quarter past eleven On a Saturday in 1999 Right across from where I'm standing On the dance floor she was landing It was clear that she was from another time Like some baby Barbarella With the stars as her umbrella She asked me if I'd like to magnetise Do I have to go star-trekking'Cause it's you I should be checking So she laserbeamed me with her cosmic eyes She's just a cosmic girl Oh, yeah From another galaxy My heart's at zero gravity She's from a cosmic world Putting me in ecstasy Transmitting on my frequency She's cosmic I'm scanning all my radars Well, she said she's from a quasar Forty thousand million light years away It's a distant solar system I tried to phone but they don't list 'em So I asked her for a number all the same She said, "Step in my transporter So I can teleport ya All around my heavenly body"Oh, this could be a close encounter I should take care not to flounder Sends me into hyperspace, when I see her pretty faceThere you were freaking out Trying to get your head around The fact that me and you and love is dead See how I'm tripping out'Cause you can't decide what you really want from me Why does it have to be like this I can never tell'Cause you make me love you, love you, baby With a little L There you were shouting out Cranking up your altercations, getting upset in your desperation Screamin' and hollerin'How could this love become so paper-thin You're playing so hard to get You're making me sweat just to hold your attention I can't give you nothing more If you ain't giving nothing to me Don't you know that You make me love you, love you baby With a little L Why does it have to be like this I can never tell Seems like you're stepping on the pieces Of my broken shell'Cause you make me love, love you With a little L, you know That's the way you make me love you, yeahEverything is good and brown I'm here again With a sunshine smile upon my face My friends are close at hand And all my inhibitions have disappeared without a trace I'm glad, oh, that I found Somebody who I can rely on This is the return of the space cowboy, interplanetary, good vibe zone Say, at the speed of cheeba, you and I go deeper Maybe I'm gonna have to get high just to get by You know I got that I got that cheeba, cheeba kinda space cowboy vibe Everything is good, oh, and green Say, I'm red again And I don't suppose I'm coming down I can see clearly, so high in sky A man with psychedelic picture frames Of happiness to shade his eyes He's glad, oh, that he found Somebody who he can rely onWhen I met you, you were so unique You had a little thing I'd love to keep And every movement carried much mystique I knew right then I'd carry on To you I knew my heart belongs You know, you, you give me something Something that nobody else can give And my heart started thumping You know now you're the one I truly know I dig Like the sunbeams from a perfect summer day And heaven only seems a step away When I'm with you, I just celebrate I'm hoping my message gets through There's never been someone like you I had nobody but on you, I lean Cause you got those little things that I I know I've never seen You know now, you, you give me something Something that nobody else has got And this love, that I've been wanting Oh, babe, it's turning out to be too fast to stop You know now, ooh, you give me something Something that nobody else can give See, my heart has started thumping You know, babe, you're the one I truly know I digEverybody Don't want no war, no No, no, no We're too young to die So many people All around the world, yeah All around the world Seen their brothers fry What's the motive In that madness Oh, I wish I knew, you made my people cry So politicians This time I think you'd better keep your distance Say, sing it loud We're too young to Do-do-do-do-do Da-da-do Da-da-do-do Do-do-do-do Da-da-do Da-da-do Do-do-do-do-do Da-da-do Da-da-do-do Do-do-do-do Da-da-do Da-da-doAm I love Every heart is beating I'm all love Can't you feel me feeling Take my hand Cold like a junkie I'm an ice cold man Why am I crying for you All this love I felt for you Has gone away to another place I put my faith in a digital world Where they've given me Eyes without a face I steal the moon on silver nights Remind myself I am someone My soul is null and void tonight I'm automaton I'm so tough Can't you see me running See, I can touch Can you feel me coming I see the world And cry for freedom These metal eyes, they can't disguise The fact that I Need something to believe in But then I'm dying for you
