You promised the world and I fell for it I put you first and you adored it Set fires to my forest And you let it burn Sang off-key in my chorus'Cause it wasn't yours I saw the signs and I ignored it Rose-colored glasses all distorted Set fire to my purpose And I let it burn You got off on the hurtin'When it wasn't yours, yeah We'd always go into it blindly I needed to lose you to find me This dancing was killing me softly I needed to hate you to love me, yeah To love, love, yeah To love, love, yeah To love, yeah I needed to lose you to love me, yeah To love, love, yeah To love, love, yeah To love, yeah I needed to lose you to love meIn your eyes, there's a heavy blue One to love, and one to lose Sweet divine, a heavy truth Water or wine, don't make me choose I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky I've been running through the jungle I've been running with the wolves To get to you, to get to you I've been down the darkest alleys Saw the dark side of the moon To get to you, to get to you I've looked for love in every stranger Took too much to ease the anger All for you, yeah, all for you I've been running through the jungle I've been crying with the wolves To get to you, to get to you, to get to you To get to you To get to youTook you like a shot Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'Let a couple years water down how I’m feelin' about you And every time we talk Every single word builds up to this moment And I gotta convince myself I don’t want it even though I do You could break my heart in two But when it heals, it beats for you I know it's forward, but it's true I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to When I'm lyin' close to someone else You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it If I could do it all again, I know I’d go back to you I know I’d go back to you, oh I know I'd go back to you We never got it right Playin’ and replayin' old conversations Overthinkin' every word and I hate it'Cause it’s not me And what's the point in hidin'?Everybody knows, we got unfinished business And I'll regret it if I didn't say This isn't what it could be Take it or leave it Baby take it or leave it But I know you won't leave it'Cause I know that you need it Look in the mirror When I look in the mirror Baby I see it clearer Why you wanna be nearer I'm not surprised I sympathize, ah I can't deny Your appetite, ah You got a fetish for my love I push you out and you come right back Don't see a point in blaming you If I were you, I'd do me too You got a fetish for my love I push you out and you come right back Don't see a point in blaming you If I were you, I'd do me too You got a fetish for my loveCome a little closer 'cause you lookin' thirsty I'ma make it better, sip it like a Slurpee Snow cone chilly, get it free like Willy In the jeans like Billie, you be poppin' like a wheelie Even in the sun, you know I keep it icy You could take a lick, but it's too cold to bite me Brr, brr, frozen, you're the one been chosen Play the part like Moses, keep it fresh like roses Look so good, yeah, look so sweet Lookin' good enough to eat Coldest with the kiss, so he call me ice cream Catch me in the fridge, right where the ice be Look so good, yeah, look so sweet Baby, you deserve a treat Diamonds on my wrist, so he call me ice cream You could double-dip 'cause I know you like me Ice cream chillin', chillin', ice cream chillin'Ice cream chillin', chillin', ice cream chillin'I know that my heart can be so cold But I'm sweet for you, come put me in a cone You're the only touch, yeah, that get me meltin'He's my favorite flavor, always gonna pick him You're the cherry piece, just stay on top of me, so I can't see nobody else for me, no Get it, flip it, scoop it, do it like that, oh yeah, oh yeah Like it, love it, lick it, do it like la-la-la, oh yeahI was walking down the street the other day Tryna distract myself But then I see your face Oh wait, that's someone else Tryna play it coy Tryna make it disappear But just like the battle of Troy There's nothing subtle here In my room there's a king size space Bigger than it used to be If you want you can rent that place Call me an amenity Even if it's in my dreams Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'I'm tryin', I'm tryin'Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'I'm tryin', I'm tryin'Not to think about you No, no, no, no Not to think about you No, no, no, no Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'I'm tryin', I'm tryin'Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'I'm tryin', I'm tryin'Not to give in to you No, no, no, no Not to give in to you No, no, no, noYeah They fell in love one summer A little too wild for each other Shiny 'til it wasn't Feels good 'til it doesn't It was her first real lover His too 'til he had another Oh, God, when she found out Trust levels went way down Of course she was sad But now she's glad she dodged a bullet Took a few years to soak up the tears But look at her now, watch her go Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm Look at her now, watch her go Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm Wow, look at her now Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm Look at her now, watch her go Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm Wow, look at her nowI'm on my 14 carats I'm 14 carat Doing it up like Midas Now you say I got a touch So good, so good Make you never wanna leave So don't, so don't Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight Do my hair up real, real nice And syncopate my skin to your heart beating Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you I just wanna look good for you, good for you Let me show you how proud I am to be yours Leave this dress a mess on the floor And still look good for you, good for you I'm on my marquise diamonds I'm a marquise diamond Could even make that Tiffany jealous You say I give it to you hard So bad, so bad Make you never wanna leave I won't, I won'tWhat the heart wants What the heart wants What the heart wants You got me sipping on something I can't compare to nothing I've ever known I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive I know I'm acting a bit crazy Strung out, a little bit hazy Hand over heart, I'm praying That I'm gonna make it out alive The bed's getting cold and you're not here The future that we hold is so unclear But I'm not alive until you call And I'll bet the odds against it all Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear You might be right, but I don't care There's a million reasons why I should give you up But the heart wants what it wants The heart wants what it wantsYou promised the world and I fell for it I put you first and you adored it Set fires to my forest And you let it burn Sang off-key in my chorus'Cause it wasn't yours I saw the signs and I ignored it Rose-colored glasses all distorted Set fire to my purpose And I let it burn You got off on the hurtin'When it wasn't yours, yeah We'd always go into it blindly I needed to lose you to
