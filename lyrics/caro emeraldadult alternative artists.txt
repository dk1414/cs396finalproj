I took the perfect avenue Down the road to both of you Did I go Dutch  This is too much With all the money in the world You could never buy this girl Quite enough, it will be tough If romancing me with neons is something you should do Make the letters bright and luminous and blue And get me waking up, shake it up, tangled up You could be quaking up, making up, tangled up You can't be faking it, making it for my love Before it's tragedy, don't get me tangled up I can't separate your sins To me you're acting like you're twins This is a mess, is this a test How many guesses do I get Till only one of you is left You're quite the same, if love's the gameFrom where you are You see the smoke start to arise where they play cards And you walk over, softly movin' past the guards The stakes are gettin' higher, you can feel it in your heart He calls your bluff He is the ace, you never thought he'd play that much And now it's more than all these cards you want to touch You'll never know if winnin' this could really be enough Take a look Beyond the moon you'll see the stars And when you look around You know the room by heart I have never dreamed it Have you ever dreamed a night like this I cannot believe it I may never see a night like this When everything you think is incomplete Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek Could you ever dream it I have never dreamed Dreamed a night like thisNew Orleans, 1951  A bar full of genius players, double dealing, sweet talking players with more on their mind than numbers, converge where the hustlers lay on the sugar thicker than the cheap wine that flows in the back rooms of the gambling halls  Eyes shift to the white girl who is obviously lost, or from out of town  And as soon as the timpani plays and she grabs the microphone, her voice moves her from pariah to princess of the pleasure dome  A coincidence  No, not really...I can't stop shaking The room has a groove and the floor It's almost earthquaking Uh-uh Look what we're making History out on the floor And it's just awaking Uh-uh So get that needle in the core Scratch that back and gimme more You know 'zactly what I came here for Back it up and do it again From the middle to the top to the end Ba dlun dla dla doday Ba dlun dla dla doday Back to the middle to the front to the end Za dlun dla dla doday Everybody ba dlun doday I don't care if he's a friend From the front to the middle to the back to the endBaby, pass the aspirin—something’s gotta work I know I did it to myself, but man oh man, it hurts That second last Martini, the one that went down real smooth Set me on a bender with nothing left to lose I just can’t apologize for what I did to myself My bed’s an ocean liner and I can’t call for help Yeah, baby, it hurts a bunch The girls got goin’ and we had a munch I promise on a dime it’s the last time I’ll ever have a liquid lunch Yeah, baby, it hurts a bunch The girls got goin’ and we had a munch I promise on a dime it’s the last time I’ll ever have a liquid lunch I think I’ve got the symptoms and none of them will leave They think that it’s a party to laugh at all my grief It must have been a doozy—I had two hundred dreams At least I found my pillow, ‘cause I can’t find my keysI don’t know what you must be on You walked in like the Aga Khan Did you fly in on a jet Win a million dollar bet So let me get my good shoes on I wanna follow in the same old steps Where you waltz around like you’re the best Where your garden blooms in May But it's snowing every day‘Cause you have everything you want You must be The Houdini in my life But you can’t see I could never be your wife‘Cause I’m still a lady No, I’m not some wench That falls for your lines I’m not on the fence Your routine is fading Boy, I could use a wrench I know my words won’t fail me Please excuse my FrenchTime just flies The clock rings and it’s half past eleven Can’t believe it but the time just flies Soon I’ll be on a cruise into heaven Hearin' stories and 1000 lies About the things that I’d never do Experience that I don’t have It’s kinda scary, I’m the big queen Mary Gotta get it, gotta do it fast Gotta grab a piece of paper, I wish I could find my pen What am I taking you  What am I waitin' for I gotta pack, gotta pack up the Louie And I can’t leave a thing behind Gotta pack, gotta pack up the Louie For every different change of mind I gotta pack it for every reason Every season be another day I gotta pack, gotta pack up the Louie I love my Louie when I go awayHey Toscanini, can you make me swoon I like the oboe but I love the bassoon Some more  would light the flambé Get down and dirty and I might wanna stay Whatchugot  Mister, mister, gave me something real hot Whatchugot  Keep it going 'til I tell you to stop I want a love practitioner, a fun commissioner An all night finisher, let's have a ball So whatchugot Whatchugot Whatchugot, hmm I like Puccini with some midnight wine Are you Italian 'cause you're dressed so fine Where's your Ferrari, is it parked out back I'd like to see it, is it shiny and black Whatchugot  Mister, mister, gave me something real hot Whatchugot  Keep it going 'til I tell you to stop I want a love practitioner, a fun commissioner An all night finisher, let's have a ball So whatchugot Let's have a.. I live deep in symmetry In my anonymity Je t’adore, ma vie tres difficile I’ll take hours to perfect In this room of disconnect All I need are mannequins and me Fabrics draped from arm to arm Rescuing my heart from harm All that I conceive speaks of finesse Radically my fashion dreams Costuming and models scream Fame is nothing more than force duress Let them comment of my cold behavior Beauty has a price that’s paid by greed Where I am I will stand alone I don’t need the money I don't want for much These two hands Never will they mourn I’d rather you not love me Before you want too muchI live on the edge But something has me really turning red I toss and then I turn inside this bed, oh yeah Yeah, I said it I'm unsatisfied With all the Romeos and their goodbyes Their 'See ya later's incomplete the lies That's why I sigh It's not just me I talk about Our rage is on the way All the money in the women's world will never make him change Gonna grab the yellow pages Find Da Vinci of the threads To dress me up and make me look like someone else instead It's time for my rehearsal, the ultimate reversal You see, I've got a plan I'm coming back as a man I'm gonna wear blue And find a pair of flat black leather shoes That shine more than a diamond mine could do And add something new Like wear a cologne That says you are the man I'm gonna own And whispers 'baby, will you take me home  'Va va va va va vumLove, I was wrong and you were right again I came to find you when you ran away You said alone would be the perfect place A paradise I asked you why and you would never speak You made it like a game of hide and seek But not before you took control of me In paradise If you gave a little, all you do is take it back again Leave me in the middle until I would reminisce again And I never ever thought you would leave me Never ever would you deceive me Never ever would you betray me Never ever you'd try to slay me Never ever thought you would leave me Never ever would you deceive me Never ever would you betray me Never ever, you tried to slay me
