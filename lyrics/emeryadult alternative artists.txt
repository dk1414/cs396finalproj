I'm here Where endless meets the end Do you see me I'm hidden here again Your whisper's found its way Calling me to stay I'm standing at the edge But something always brings me back All the voices in my head Reminding me of what I have If I fall tonight You can bring me back to life If I fall tonight You can be my saving light You can be my saving light You can be my saving light You can be my saving light You're here Like lightning in my veins Now they see me And they'll never be insane Your whisper's found its way Calling me to stayHard wind blows as the night is born And the dark feels so safe My body yearns for that need to start Cause it's too hard to wait We're going out tonight with something to prove Take too the streets and let our demons lose Your body moves to the boom, boom, boom Heart pounds from across the room No more secrets, no more lies Blood moon rises, fire out the sky Put your hands on me Put your trust in me Red moon glows and my soul is torn Let the stars seal our fate But bodies fear that this war will end Can't live without the ache You're reaching out across this madness for truth Break from these chains and make my kingdom newMmm, these times are catchin' up to me But simple things don't come easy And you can't miss a thing, no I've been sleepin' just to dream About the way I wish it was Not fuckin' all your followers We were in your room just talkin' shit You yellin' just to prove you're into it At least you're fightin' for somethin', yeah I hope you're happy now, but you could do better You have your reasons, but they change with the weather Admit you don't know what you want But you got what you thought it was And I hope you're happy now Your birds flock together Yuh, it goes suicide, super sad, super fly, super bad And Super Sayian, what you mean to me Agree to disagree, a beautiful chemistry We blew it to smithereens Your friends claimin' they knew me And while my seasons was changin'All them was readin' the same scripts Stepped out for the movie Was over, and everybody wanna control you You on the road for 300 days Come back, your father pass away And all you wanna scream is Don't wanna fight you for me Do-do-do-do, damn Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, least we fightin' for somethin'Are you listening We write a thousand pages, they're torn and on the floor Headlights hammer the windows, we're locked behind these doors And we are never leaving, this place is part of us And all these scenes repeating are cold to the touch My hands seem to deceive me when I'm nervous or when I'm Healthy, the scenery's all drawn They hang here from the walls dear, painting pictures, bleeding Colors, blanket the windows Sometimes it gets so hard to breathe Your eyes see right through me These fights with your arms left beside It's one thing, and one more says goodnight You've got the map, come get to me These knuckles break before they bleed Tear out these veins that own my heart This skin that wears your lasting marks I've built these walls, come get to me Come get to meThree sleepless nights This isn't how it's supposed to be But you're so good at taking your time To get back to me I will wait for you forever If you would just ask me I thought that I could change you But you changed me But it doesn't feel right Holding someone else's hand Together on phone lines And living at two opposite ends It scares me to think that you could find takers Other than me and better than me But your head is elsewhere And I'm talking enough for both of us When will you see it's not so easy for me You're careless and whispered Insulting and bruising And I thought that you said Things were improving These laces are untied But my feet are walking awayI've got eyes in the back of my head And I see where you're going with this I'm not surprised You take me for a fool and maybe you're right If I was wiser I would not have let myself come here tonight You sold yourself, you'll never learn And here I am watching the summer fading   Your hands were warm on my face, now they're cold and pushing away Slowly away  Pushing me away I knew it  right from the start I've got this big, big hole in my heart I wanted  to put you in But for some reason You just wouldn't fit You just wouldn't fit You sold yourself, you'll never learn And here I am watching the summer fading   Your hands were warm on my face, now they're cold and pushing away Slowly away  Pushing me away Pushing me awayLet me breathe you in, and breathe the words in your mouth Inside you're shivering, the silence shouts so loud I just want to, I just want to stay around And while my heart beats, I promise I won't let you down If I'm somewhere else, it doesn't mean that I don't see That you don't trust yourself, that's why you don't trust me It makes me crazy, when you're crazy You don't speak, you think you know me But what you know is just skin deep If you keep building these walls, brick by brick, towers so tall Soon I won't see you at all, 'til the concrete angel falls I knew who you were from the start But now I don't know who you are Soon there'll be nothing at all, until the concrete angel falls If you keep building these walls, brick by brick, towers so tall Soon I won't see you at all, 'til the concrete angel falls I knew who you were from the start But now I don't know who you are Soon there'll be nothing at all, until the concrete angel fallsI let you in, into my world I gave you things you said you deserved But you took all I had, threw it back in my face At the hardest time, worst possible place I know that I was not to blame So go ahead and take everything When it's over I'll still be standing Because I was here from the start You won the war, but still you lost my heart In all my plans, you followed me You crossed your heart and said you believed But you took all I had, threw it back in my face At the hardest time, worst possible place I know that I was not to blame So go ahead and take everything When it's over I'll still be standing Because I was here from the start You won the war, but still you lost my heartI'm comin’ for your crown, here to take you down And when the pieces fall, I'll marvel in it all Hold 'em, baby don’t you show 'em, better fold 'em Cashin' in your money for the diamonds, diamonds Had you from the start You're playin' with fire, you ain't no king'Cause this is my kingdom and I’m your queen If you desire all of me, come to my kingdom Bow down to your queen Bow down to your queen Bow down to your queen Bow down to your queen You’re lookin' kind of flush, about to call your bluff And when you lose your shirt, I’ll show you what I'm worth Hold 'em, baby don't you show ’em, better fold 'em Cashin' in your money for the diamonds, diamonds Had you from the startI'm here Where endless meets the end Do you see me I'm hidden here again Your whisper's found its way Calling me to stay I'm standing at the edge But something always brings me back All the voices in my head Reminding me of what I have If I fall tonight You can bring me back to life If I fall tonight You can be my saving light You can be my saving light You can be my saving light You can be my saving light You're here Like lightning in my veins Now they see me And they'll never be insane Your whisper's found its way Calling me to stay
