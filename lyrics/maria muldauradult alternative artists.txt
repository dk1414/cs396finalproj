Midnight at the oasis Send your camel to bed Shadows painting our faces Traces of romance in our heads Heaven's holding a half moon Shining just for us Let's slip off to A sand dune, real soon And kick up a little dust Come on, cactus is our friend He'll point out the way Come on, 'til the evening ends'Til the evening ends You don't have to answer There's no need to speak I'll be your belly dancer, prancer And you can be my sheik I know your daddy's a sultan A nomad known to all With fifty girls to attend him They all send him Jump at his beck and callIt ain't the meat it's the motion That makes your daddy wanna rock It ain't the meat it's the motion It's the movement it isn't the stock Well, I got a girl that's so darn thin There ain't much of her but bones and skin One thing about her I can understand She wraps all around me like a rubber band, baby It ain't the meat it's the motion That makes your daddy wanna rock It ain't the meat it's the motion It's the movement it isn't the stock Well, I want a girl who's built real fat Kenny don't like to see 'em like that But I like to see 'em big and tall The bigger they come the harder they fall It ain't the meat it's the motion That makes your daddy wanna rock It ain't the meat it's the motion It's the movement it isn't the stock Well, I want someone who feels like they got to have love Love to look at the stars above My little baby, I want you to know She'll bring me home all of her doughCarrying on a conversation Looking in your eyes The words they seem to pass us by You know as well as I How many kinds of tribulation Must a friend endure The years, they leave a man unsure Of where to beg when he is poor Woah baby, how I love you Mad as I think you are Guess you think I'm crazy too But mad, mad me, I love you Carrying on with a word is mindless Your eyes aflame to me They jump and burn and make me see How much to you I wanna be How much to you I wanna be Woah baby, how I love you Mad as I think you are Guess you think I'm crazy too But mad, mad me, I love youBack before the blues were blue When the good old songs were new Songs that may no longer please us‘Bout the darkies, about Jesus Mississippi minstrels, color of molasses Strummin’ on their banjos to entertain their masses Some said garbage, others said art You couldn’t call it soul, you had to call it heart Woah, backs broke bendin’, diggin’ holes to plant the seeds The owners ate the cane and the workers ate the weeds Puttin’ wood in the stove and water in the cup You worked so hard that you died standin’ up When I was a little thing My poppa tried to make me sing“Home Sweet Home” and “Aurelie”These were songs that my daddy taught me“Camp Town Races” and “Susannah Don’t You Cry”“Gentle Annie” still brings a tear to my eye Label it garbage, label it art You couldn’t call it soul, you had to call it heartHasn't it been a long hard climb Everything taking its own sweet time And hasn't there been some long, lonely nights When you didn't think that anything would turn out right Woah, baby, come and lay by me In the cool, cool shade of that old oak tree You can go, oh, so high Paint a mile to that long way down You can paint a rainbow in the sky Just try to keep your both feet on the ground Woah, baby, come and lay by me In the cool, cool shade of that old oak tree Hey, can you see that sun outside Say, can you feel it deep inside like a song Like a long, long string Hasn't it been a long hard climb Everything taking its own sweet time And hasn't there been some long, lonely nights When you didn't think that anything would turn out right I just received your letter You’re down and out, you say At first I thought I would tell you To travel on the other way But in my memory lingers All you once were to me So I’m gonna give you one more chance To prove what you can be Any old time you wanna come back home Drop me a line And say no more you’ll roam You had your chance to play the game fair Oh, when you left me, sweetheart You only left a load of care Now that you’re down, I’m gonna stick by you If you will only tell me Your roaming days are through You’ll find me here, like the day you left me alone Any old time you wanna come back home Any old time you wanna come back home Drop me a line Honey, say no more you’ll roam You had your chance to play the game fair Oh, when you left me, sweetheart You only left a world of care You’ll find me here, like the day you left me alone Any old time you wanna come back homeDon’t you feel my leg Don’t you feel my leg‘Cause if you feel my leg You’re gonna feel my thigh And if you feel my thigh You’re gonna go up high So don’t you feel my leg Don’t you buy no rye Don’t you buy no rye‘Cause if you buy me rye You’re gonna make me high And if you make me high You get a big surprise So don’t you buy no rye You say you’ll take me dancing Buy me gin and wine But I know different, you got something else on your mind You say we’ll ball and have a lovely time But what I got is mine, all mine Don’t you feel my leg Don’t you feel my leg‘Cause if you feel my leg You’ll wanna feel my thigh And if you feel my thigh You’re gonna make me high So don’t you feel my thighI never did sing you a love song I only sang phrases in time I never did write you a sonnet I just laid my thoughts down in rhyme Up and down the river So many boats to ride Yet, precious few deliver The goods that we need to survive Mmm-mmm I never spoke falsely or crossly I never put tears in your eyes And you never shattered my lonely heart You never deceived me with lies And yet, somehow, I seem to recall I stirred in my sleep for a while Dreaming of a river man Exchanging my life for a smile Oh-oh-ohYou catch ‘em on the fly And you leave ‘em high and dry Oh, but I’m up on your game, baby And your two-bit alibi But you just won’t quit And you don’t even wanna try You’re livin’ out of your suitcase And the rat race’ll run you dry You’re just a three dollar bill You’re just a three dollar bill Tellin’ your travelin’ salesman jokes Like a politician kissin’ babies, hustlin’ votes And baby, you’re just a three dollar Baby, you’re just a three dollar Baby, you’re just a three, you’re just a three dollar bill You’re weak for the young girls You love ‘em and you leave ‘em Mmm, your favorite hobby Is seduce ‘em and deceive ‘em Mmm, but one day you’ll get
