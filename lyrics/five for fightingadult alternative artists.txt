I'm fifteen for a moment Caught in between ten and twenty And I'm just dreaming Counting the ways to where you are I'm twenty-two for a moment And she feels better than ever And we're on fire Making our way back from Mars Fifteen, there's still time for you Time to buy and time to lose, fifteen There's never a wish better than this When you only got a hundred years to live I'm thirty-three for a moment I'm still the man, but you see I'm a "they"A kid on the way, babe A family on my mind I'm forty-five for a moment The sea is high And I'm heading into a crisis Chasing the years of my lifeThere was a man back in '95 Whose heart ran out of summers, but before he died I asked him, "Wait, what's the sense in life Come over me, come over me"He said, "Son, why you gotta sing that tune Catch a Dylan song, or some eclipse of the moon Let an angel swing and make you swoon Then you will see, you will see"Then he said, "Here's a riddle for ya Find the answer There's a reason for the world You and I"Picked up my kid from school today"Did you learn anything  'Cause in the world today You can't live in a castle far away Now, talk to me, come talk to me"He said, "Dad, I'm big, but we're smaller than small In the scheme of things, well, we're nothin' at all Still, every mother's child sings a lonely song So play with me, come play with me"I can't stand to fly I'm not that naive I'm just out to find The better part of me I'm more than a bird, I'm more than a plane I'm more than some pretty face beside a train And it's not easy to be me I wish that I could cry Fall upon my knees Find a way to lie'Bout a home I'll never see It may sound absurd, but don't be naive Even heroes have the right to bleed I may be disturbed, but wonâ€™t you concede Even heroes have the right to dream And it's not easy to be me Up, up, and away, away from me Well, it's alright You can all sleep sound tonight I'm not crazy or anythingThere's no time to waste In this famous goodbye There's Angels landing on the shore So lay down with me Let the river run dry It's Sunday in the six-day war Smile darling don't be sad Stars are going to shine tonight Tell me where the good men go Before I wash away Walk me down the old brick road So I can die where I met you Hold me like we're going home Turn your tears to rain Bury me beautiful Heaven knows how I loved you There's a children's choir in perfect parade Singing like they found the Lord I can't say it they'll let me in But we can dance the way we did High above up the seventh floorChances are when said and done Who'll be the lucky ones Who make it all the way Though you say I could be your answer Nothing lasts forever No matter how it feels today Chances are we'll find a new equation Chances rolled away from me Chances are all they hope to be Don't get me wrong I'd never say never'Cause though love can't change the weather No act of God can pull me away from you I'm just a realistic man A bottle filled with shells and sand Afraid to love beyond what I can lose When it comes to you And though I see us through, yeah Chances are we'll find two destinations Chances roll away from me Still, chances are more than expectations But possibilities over meSo hear we are The future's now The time, your time, has come The stage is set The lines are drawn Today you'll shine, my son Earth is shaking Don't be scared You were born to walk So that you could run You were born to fall So that you could stand up strong Sometimes you gotta bleed So you can feel your skin You were born to win Your not alone We've been here before On giant shoulders, tall you stand All is that you need All is that you have When you fit right in my handThere was a time a long, long time ago Chevy's and levees played on the radio No cell phones, just twenty thousand lights Swaying on a Saturday night alright Can you imagine that slice of time Rock and roll was young, people stood in line To hear music that played into their lives That you could carry 'till the day you die Hey man sing me a song When we were everyone We were more than just a slice Of American Pie Have you read my blog today Three hundred million little U SA's Your doorstep is just a click away We'll get together one of these days How can you be as nice as me You're not from the same slice as me Where do we go from here my friend Is this the way our story endsI bruise you You bruise me We both bruise so easily Too easily to let it show I love you, and that's all I know And all my plans Keep falling through All my plans they Depend on you Depend on you To help them grow I love you And that's all I know When the singer's gone Let the song go on It's a fine line between The darkness and the dawn They say in the darkest night There's a light beyond And the ending always Comes at last Endings always Come too fast They come too fast And they pass too slow I love you And that's all, it's really all I know It's all I knowThrew a line out to pull you to me If you don't get it, then you don't get it You made your mind up before you knew me If you don't get it, then you don't get it Take my hand for a minute We're in it - imagine all the pain that might be forgiven What if I had your heart What if you wore my scars How would we break down What if you were me and what if I were you What if you told my lies What if I cried with your eyes Could anyone keep us down What if you were me  What if I were you Had a dream of a new tomorrow If you don't get it, then you don't get it I took a step hoping you might follow If you don't get it, then you don't get it Take a chance for a minute  Jump in it Imagine if you asked yourself for a minute:I'm fifteen for a moment Caught in between ten and twenty And I'm just dreaming Counting the ways to where you are I'm twenty-two for a moment And she feels better than ever And we're on fire Making our way back from Mars Fifteen, there's still time for you Time to buy and time to lose, fifteen There's never a wish better than this When you only got a hundred years to live I'm thirty-three for a moment I'm still the man, but you see I'm a "they"A kid on the way, babe A family on my mind I'm forty-five for a moment The sea is high And I'm heading into a crisis Chasing the years of my life
