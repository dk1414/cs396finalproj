out of my head Boy, it's more than I dare to think about Every night, every day Just to be there in your arms Won't you stay  Won't you lay Stay forever and ever and ever and everSpinning around, spinning around Oh I'm spinning around, move out of my way I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this Traded in my sorrow for some joy that I borrowed From back in the day Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe I got something to say I'm through with the past, ain't no point in looking back The future will be And did I forget to mention that I found a new direction And it leads back to me I'm spinning around, move out of my way I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like thisWe're a million miles apart in a thousand ways Baby, you can light up the dark like a solar scape And I can almost feel you coming and your heartbeat race Someone, somebody, something, in the choice we make I, I think about you Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah S-s-s-say something, say something Tell me how you're feeling Oh, we all got wanderlust in the darkest place So we're going with our heart, yeah, it's all the rage Oh, we're just, just tryin' to find ourselves in the storms we chase Eh, eh, eh Baby, in an endless summer, we can find our way I, I think about you Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah S-s-s-say something, say something Tell me how you're feelingThought that I was going crazy Just having one of those days, yeah Didn't know what to do Then there was you And everything went from wrong to right And the stars came out, filled up the sky The music you were playing really blew my mind It was love at first sight'Cause, baby, when I heard you For the first time, I knew We were meant to be as one Was tired of running out of luck Thinking 'bout giving up, yeah Didn't know what to do Then there was you And everything went from wrong to right And the stars came out, filled up the sky The music you were playing really blew my mind It was love at first sightNo one wants to stay at home Nobody wants to be alone When you come knocking, I’ll be at your door I don’t ever wanna stop I’m gonna give it all I've got And when they ask me, “Who could ask for more ”Can’t stand still I won’t slow down When I go out, I wanna go out dancing Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah When I go out, I wanna go out dancing Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah I wanna go out dancing I wanna go out I wanna go out dancing This is where I wanna be with you Your arms wrapped around me And fireworks reflecting in your eyes This is how I wanna feel The wine, the kiss, the music real And getting down, riding all the highsWhat's the worst thing that could happen to you Take a chance tonight and try something new You're getting boring, you're oh-so boring And I don't recognize the zombie you've turned into Don't worry 'cause tonight, I got you You can take a seat, do what you normally do I'm about to let you see This is what'll happen if you ain't giving your girl what she needs Leave you, move on to a perfect stranger You talk, I walk, wanna feel the danger See me with him and it's turning you on It's got me saying Ain't getting me back at the end of this song Get outta my way, get outta my way Got no more to say, he's taken your place Get outta my way, way outta my way Got no more to say, he's taken your place Get outta my way Now I got a taste, I wanna explore Ain't going to waste, no, not anymore You're going hard now, to win my heart But too many times now, you've been coming up shortI feel like anything could happen The stars look different tonight They're glowin' all around me It's flowin' through my body I can feel it I can feel it Don't know if I'm awake or dreamin'There must be somethin' in the air The time is disappearin'This moment's never leavin'I can feel it I can feel it You got me started Ain't nothin' on earth can stop it It's crazy, I'm fallin'I don't know what else to call it Oh, do you believe in magic Do you, do you, do you Do you believe in magic Ooh Dancin' together Ain't nothin' that could be better Tomorrow don't matter We'll make the night last forеver So do you believе in magic Do you, do you, do you Do you believe in magic OohFeel my heartbeat It's the same old feeling coming over me tonight Me tonight Feel it buzzing Said I'm never gonna call, but tonight, I think I might Think I might Gave my heart a ride, bump in the night No one can take me higher Know it's been a while, baby, a while Do you still feel the fire I saw you dancing with somebody Looking like me and you She know how to party But nothing like me and you Got that perfect body But she ain't got the moves We got something better Got that real groove, baby Major mistake No, I never shoulda gone, baby, I was on thе run On the run It was heartbreak I can't stand anothеr day knowing that you are the one You're the oneIn my imagination There is no complication I dream about you all the time In my mind, a celebration The sweetest of sensation Thinking you could be mine In my imagination There is no hesitation We walk together hand in hand I'm dreaming You fell in love with me Like I'm in love with you But dreaming's all I do If only they'd come true I should be so lucky Lucky, lucky, lucky I should be so lucky in love I should be so lucky Lucky, lucky, lucky I should be so lucky in lovePadam Padam You look like fun to me You look a little like somebody I know And I can tell you how this ends I'll be in your head all weekend Shivers and butterflies I get the shivers when I look into your eyes And I can tell that you're all in 'Cause I can hear your heart beatin'Padam Padam, padam, I hear it and I know Padam, padam, I know you wanna take me home Padam, and get to know me close Padam, padam, when your heart goes Padam, padam, I hear it and I know Padam, padam, I know you wanna take me home Padam, and take off all my clothes Padam, padam, when your hеart goes "padam"
