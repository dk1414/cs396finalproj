the walls Just waiting for imaginary telephone calls And I'm so agitated, so agitated A-a-a-a, a-agitated And I'm so agitated, I'm so agitated I'm so agitated that I'm so agitated You know what I think, I think the whole world stinks And I don't need no shrink, I just hate it Ugh I'm so agitated, so agitated So agitated that I'm so agitated So agitated, I'm so convoluted I'm so convoluted that I'm so agitatedFrom the goddamn first thing I do in the morning, 'til the goddamn last thing I do at night Oh wouldn't it be so terribly nice Don't you ever want to get it right All my goddamn ex-friends, they oh so politely criticize me and advise me They don't know what they're talking about, they don't mean a thing A bunch of stupid assholes hanging onto strings, and you're full of shit,
