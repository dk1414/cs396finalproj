]This town has its claws buried in my neck This town, it takes lives without mercy, without hate The grass is growing on top of my feet I'm sinking, won't be long before I'm too deep to run We are the dead ones, we are the lost cause We are the bend before the break, our steps seal our fate]Because this city, this city is haunted By ghosts From broken homes Because this city, this city is haunted And there's no hope Left for these souls ]Every step I take, I leave a small piece Of myself behind - soon there will be nothing left The sky's a brick wall, the ground's a juggernaut Each day they get a bit closer; between them I am caught Every breath I take, I feel my lungs seal This breeze feels more like shards of glass I'm more scars than skinNot sure what's worse The wait, or the waiting room"You're next, sir"Becomes a cruel taunt to you Recycled air The smell of sleep and disinfectant Your god is A two door elevator Do they even cure you Or is it just to humor us before we die If only we could Heal ourselves We wouldn't Need to be hooked up to these machinesSifting through weathered photo albums Looking for gloriously aged polaroids Of places you've never been A place to accept you don't exist"Smile for the camera, sweetheart I really wanna immortalize this moment Just remember the first step in forgetting Is destroying all the evidence"With friends Like you Who needs Subtext Subtext Subtext This is a .44 caliber love letter straight from my heartWas I left behind Someone tell me, tell me I survived And don't look so surprised that I'm home, but just for tonight With rough hands, and sore eyes So don't speak; I am tired Let's just live through this lie She says I swear too much, she says a lot of things Well I'd swear every other word if I could, for her I'll make an attempt Sometimes love isn't about how much someone suits you But how much you're willing to change to suit them]All my bones are dust And my heart's sealed with rust These hands will always be rough I know this won't count for much One day my hands were too soft One day she said "I'm tired"One day her clothes were on my floor One day, empty bottles Well I'm not saying she's my last I'm just saying that she could have been It doesn't matter how rough these hands get It doesn't matter 'cause I'm not her manA man sits at his desk one year from retirement And he's up for review, not quite sure what to do Each passing year the workload grows I'm always wishing, I'm always wishing too late For things to go my way, it always ends up the same Count your blessings I must be missing, I must be missing the point Your signal fades away and all I'm left with is noise Count your blessings on one hand So wait up, I'm not sleeping alone again tonight There's so much to dream about, there must be more to my life Poor little tin man still swinging his axe Even though his joints are clogged with rust My youth is slipping, my youth is slipping away Safe in monotony  day after day Count your blessings My youth is slipping, my youth is slipping away Cold wind blows off the lake and I know for sure that it's too late Count your blessings on one handLet's go!It's never too late to be early Or try and maintain Some scrap of integrity and certainty I guess Won't apologize and 1977 was a long time ago Was a long time ago..  I don't care I don't care how things Were and I won't Apologize, I won't apologize Fuck you The Alamo has been penetrated And there is little hope For the white man so hop on your rainbow Ride it...So hop on your rainbow and ride into oblivion For all I care, you could be early, or late, whateverI'm thinking that it's time to get out, my patients are fading fast The mind bruises just a little bit easier in dark times and shadow's cast What are you suffering for Your pride or some kind of personal war And will you throw it away For nothing more than a simple taste ]I stay in time and watch you pass by I draw this line and hope you'll take my side You shouldn't have to fight alone It's nobody's battle but your own Panic holds me like a gun, firm and steadfast, bleak and cold I think it's time to kill the drama, this lifestyle's getting old Whispers from behind closed doors, eyes spy from dark windows Plotting minds that seek to harm me or maybe not, I don't really know There is something waiting for me in the darkest part of my imaginationStrange things happen in the nighttime hour Yesterday’s buds are tomorrow’s flowers Those who speak numbers, refuse the great forgiver And powerful men raise their hands and deliver All the superstitions to which we all cling While high minds in Geneva ponder E8 versus string The sun hides itself concealing its grin And waits for the dawn to reveal itself again Oh, young cardinals Nesting in the trees Oh, hear our songs And reign your innocence on me Strange things happen in the nighttime hours White tails graze and wolves devour Ghosts of old loves are blowing through the vines Nicotine babies being born with no spines The god of the sea is swinging his trident We stoke our fires with the bones of tyrants The sun, it retreats through the dust and the din And waits for the dawn to reveal itself againSo this is continuous happiness You know, I always Imagined it something more With the right drapes, the right paints The right frames, this could really work What a great day to spend indoors Wake, wake up, wake, wake up Wake, wake up, wake, wake up Wake, wake up, wake, wake up Wake, wake up, wake, wake up In a hail of sparks And a tangle of wires Everything went wrong So where has all the day gone And why are my lungs aching when I breathe Is there something wrong with the heat Why am I so cold And my heart feels sick And it hurts when I speak And this is not what I hoped for Wake, wake up, wake, wake up Wake, wake up, wake, wake up Wake, wake up, wake, wake up Wake, wake up, wake, wake upThis burden's not a heavy one But I assure you It's present This burden's not a heavy one But I assure you It is present Say that you're in control Say that you are I can't think of a time When you looked less alive You said "Wait until light, my dear Just wait until light"One more day Will go by Maybe today You should try To look past the mirror, and find Look past the mirror That there's something inside Something more to your life But my words won't heal you now My words won't heal It is you who decides It is you who decides
