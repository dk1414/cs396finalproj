again Well, when you're down on your luck And you ain't got a buck In London you're a goner Even London Bridge Has fallen down And moved to Arizona Now I know why And I'll substantiate the rumor That the English sense of humor Is drier than than the Texas sand You can put up your dukes Or you can bet your boots That I'm leavin' just as fast as I can I wanna go home with the armadillo Good country music from Amarillo And Abilene The friendliest people and the prettiest women you ever seenWell, I could live my whole life Without a phone call The likes of which I got today It was only my wife Said hello then goodbye And told me she's goin' away Well, I didn't cry It was all cut and dry I hung up before I realized I turned up my stereo I walked to the window And stared at the storm clouds outside And I play classical music when it rains I play country when I am in pain But I won't play Beethoven 'cause the mood's just not right Oh, I feel like Hank Williams tonight There's no explanation Not even a reason No talk of the good times we had Was it me  Was it her I don't know for sure And that's why I'm feeling so badPack up all your dishes Make note of all good wishes Say goodby to the landlord for me That sum-bitch has always bored me Throw out them old L A papers And that moldy box of vanilla wafers Adios to all this concrete Gonna get me some dirt road back street If I can just get off of that L.A  freeway Without getting killed or caught Down that road in a cloud of smoke For some land that I ain't bought bought bought If I can just get off of that L.A  freeway Here's to you old skinny Dennis Only one I think I will miss I can hear your Bassman singin'Sweet and low like a gift your bringin'Play it for me one more time now Got to give it all we can now I beleive everything your saying Just keep on keep on playing ChorusWell, I've been gone for so long Feels so good just to get back home Back to my friends and all the faces I love to see Like a rainbow in the sky A certain twinkle that's in her eye Telling me they believe in what I am And what I want to be Don't it make you wanna dance Don't it make you wanna smile When you're down, down, down in the country Could you sing a while Don't it make you wanna dance Don't it make you wanna smile When you're down, down, down in the country Could you sing a while Oh Lord, don't it feel right tonight Makin' music when you feel just right And feeling better with every single song And look around everyone is a friend And every single one has found his friend So when the chorus comes around They have a body to bone, yeahYeah I played the Red River Valley Sit in the kitchen and cry Run his fingers through seventy years of livin'He'd wonder if every well he'd drilled'd gone dry We was friends, me and this old man Desperados waiting for a train Desperados waiting for a train Soon as I could walk he'd take me with him To a place called the Green Frog Caf√© There was old men with beer guts and dominos Lying 'bout their lives while they played And I was just a kid, they all called me Sidekick Desperados waiting for a train Desperados waiting for a train Yeah he's a drifter, he's a driller of oil wells He's an old school man of the world He taught me how to drive his car when he's too drunk to And he'd wink and give me money for the girls And our lives was like some old Western movie Desperados waitin' for a train Desperados waitin' for a trainThis here's "Derby Day"Written on the day of the Kentucky Derby When Foolish Pleasure lost And I was tryin' to make..  amends Well, I was tryin' to finish a love song Yeah Susan, you are a jewel About the rarest I've ever seen I wish I could polish off All the edges of my craziest dreams But you know the way I am There's nothin' you could do If there's anything you don't want me to do Said, go ahead and tell me to It must have been one hell of a starry night The moon was so bright Guess it must've knocked out all of your lights I guess that's the night that you fell for my silvery line Everything we do is backwards You know that ain't a lie You love, I love, you love Ah, you know you know I love your beautiful eyes But I can't pay you back, no I can't make it up in a song I guess I'm here tryin' to tell you that I missed myself while you were goneWell I don't drink as much as I ought to Lately that just ain't my style And the hard times don't cut like they used to They pass quicker, like when I was a child And somehow I've learned how to listen To the sound of the sun dyin' down in the morning I'll be singing A song for this life I have found You know it keeps my feet on the ground Well the midsummer day sit so heavy They don't flow like the breeze through your mind When nothing appears in a hurry To make up for some old lost time And somehow I've learned how to listen To the sound of the sun dyin' down in the morning I'll be singing A song for this life I have found You know that keeps my feet on the ground
