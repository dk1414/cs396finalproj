You stand here in my place Feel the warmth upon your face Stand back and start to smile You now have time You now have will I would never want to leave this country Where roads are fast and knowledge easy I would never want to take you with me Unless you're open And trust my hand I would never wish this much on you When what you have might be enough I would never want to drive that fast Unless you're ready, willing, happy Take me Away from these simple feelings I know There's places on the other sides of here Take me Away from these simple feelings I know I'll take that car and drive there fasterGo good and gentle men I'm falling asleep again Take my sins and take my tablets Have these notions culled from oceans Hide them well in fear I'll abuse them wake up with an unchanged whim Take my sins and take my tablets Have these notions culled from oceans The third time we opened the capsule everything went.....Here sings the innocent He's turning water into brine Take my words and take my language Have these notions culled from oceans Hide them well and let them rust Falling asleep with more to trust Take my words and take my language Take my words and take my language The third time we opened the capsule everything went.... All the stones inside my head Were carefully removed By the doctor's perfumed scarlet hands She delved in deep for your savage teeth That sparkled diamonds fire blue Eating me and thrilling you The voices have now gone I'm looking forward to living alone Now it's time to say goodbye I won't stay around to be hurt by careless words So here's the jar of your hate Returned complete, sincerely yours, fully restored But peace perfect peace Could belong to me I'd bottle it For love's like the sea They're hungry gods with careless hands That wrap themselves around our lives So hard to resist They swallowed me, you swallowed me I closed my eyes, I disappearedI can feel the waves of your gorgeous love And it hurts to think that this is seen as wrong I can take your pain, anything, to overcome our fear And we're strong, strong enough to prove it I notice things about you as the morning kisses your eyes How your face relaxes through the caress of night How in the evening it's tense and pulled features And we know how easily we can smooth them You turn to touch me to hold me fast You turn to touch me to whisper your love Here are the words of those who dared to speak Of this open noisy big brilliant love Which is all I have to give I never knew that our need for love could be so strong I'm not confessing, time disappears when we're alone I'm not ashamed of expressing the love I hold for you It's ultra-romantic, I fear everything that's not you I fell asleep, when I wake You were staring at me In this dreaming orange London light You turn to touch me to hold me fast You turn to touch me to whisper your love Here are the words of those who dared to speak Of this open noisy big brilliant love Which is all I have to giveStars are falling down Onto this broken-hearted hungry clown Because he cannot get his fill Never thought that he would ever Want this much from a man But love is the steepest sharpest slide Oh here he'd lie at your side Looking up into the sky Wondering if this is allowed But fear rules him easily It takes lust and strength to Turn to you and say I want you and I need you I want you and I need you Sun has finally upped and gone Being bored of everyone I slip of my shirt and shoes Time to hate myself again My small voice and freckled skin To the safety of the darkSoftly softly comes The train into the station She has often waited And wondered if he'll come Why has he kept her waiting Held from coming home now Was it troubled loyalty Or a brand new family Will he step down Onto the platform Will he stay now Or go again Softly something comes A feeling that she loves him Remembering his birthday And sentimental times Was she really that bad To force him to silence Were her tears forgotten Or was it just that letter of pain"Daddy will you Stay this time Daddy will you Walk away "Well we were talking and we were drinking, letting the fat flow go And we were asking and we were thinking in the belly of a bar It was easy almost indifferent, until my heckles rise What's that you're asking if I remember , these pub walls are dissolving The guilt was thin then, his hair long, brown to match his eyes It's none of your business what his name was Would I even get a prize There's been a hundred and that's not boasting Just the ways of this world How dare he even ask this , these pub walls are drowning Your glass is empty just like your head It's these times I don't know you And how about you can you remember You shake your head and say "drunk"Well it's a small thing why am I angry These words are signs of warning Because behind them there's the implication...The pub is burning down So do I get a prize Do I get a prize Do I get a prize for remembering that first time Do I get a prize Do I get a prize Do I get a prize for remembering his name As she walks home tonight To her house and ignores the stars She knows there's no-one waiting Tomorrow isn't clear enough To give her strength or make her want To wake and walk in the morning And there's hope that I've taken And there's drugs to make it painless And men, we're quick as rainbows Always rare to keep her thirsty And I've gone, like she'd always known And I've gone, like she'd always known As I walk home tonight To my house and ignore the stars I know there's someone waiting Tomorrow is very clear It gives me strength and makes me want To wake and walk in the morningDraw me something Draw the line Connecting what we did to what happens now Don't understand how we changed Not sure I'll ever know It's all circles, colliding spheres I closed off, chaos appears Once we were all smiles and plans And dressing up to go Playing outside playing cars Now it's all been tamed, I yell"Don't stop  don't leave me here!Don't stop won't get caught again You can't go there's no sense anymore"A tap of tears and a veil of guilt Taunt me now Growing growing growing gone Years pick up speed again Throw me pointers No more jibes There's this ancient knot inside my chest It works it's way into my throat Will not let these stories out Refusal works, it always wins Too much thought, too few grinsOn Tooting Broadway station I knelt down and wept My hands hit the concrete floor Until my fingers bled I will cut him out of my heart I will leave these tears in pools Tripped over these pourings Tripped over his feelings I've cut him out of my heart Burn, burn his clothes Burn everything he owned And the empty chamber left I'll carry around as this hollowness That drags in my voice Burn, burn it all Burn, burn it all Benedictory fire Blessing of these burns Burn, burn it all Burn, burn it all Benedictory fire Blessing of these burns
