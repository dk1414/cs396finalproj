The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead When the skies of November turn gloomy With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed When the gales of November came early The ship was the pride of the American side Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most With a crew and good captain well seasoned Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms When they left fully loaded for Cleveland And later that night when the ship's bell rang Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound And a wave broke over the railing And every man knew, as the captain did too'Twas the witch of November come stealin'The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait When the gales of November came slashin'When afternoon came it was freezin' rain In the face of a hurricane west windIf you could read my mind, love What a tale my thoughts could tell Just like an old time movie'Bout a ghost from a wishin' well In a castle dark or a fortress strong With chains upon my feet You know that ghost is me And I will never be set free As long as I'm a ghost you can't see If I could read your mind, love What a tale your thoughts could tell Just like a paperback novel The kind the drugstores sell When you reach the part where the heartaches come The hero would be me But heroes often fail And you won't read that book again Because the ending's just too hard to take I'd walk away like a movie star Who gets burned in a three-way script Enter number two A movie queen to play the scene Of bringing all the good things out in me But for now love, let's be real I never thought I could act this way And I've got to say that I just don't get it I don't know where we went wrong But the feeling's gone and I just can't get it backI can see her lyin' back in her satin dress In a room where you do what you don't confess Sundown, you'd better take care If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs Sundown, you'd better take care If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs She's been lookin' like a queen in a sailor's dream And she don't always say what she really means Sometimes I think it's a shame When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain Sometimes I think it's a shame When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain I can picture every move that a man could make Getting lost in her lovin' is your first mistake Sundown, you'd better take care If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs Sometimes I think it's a sin When I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' againIn the early morning rain With a dollar in my hand With an aching in my heart And my pockets full of sand I'm a long way from home Lord, I miss my loved ones so In the early morning rain With no place to go Out on runway number nine Big 707's set to go And I'm stuck here in the grass With a pain that ever grows Now the liquor tasted good And the women all were fast Well, there she goes, my friend She'll be rolling down at last Hear the mighty engines roar See the silver wing on high She's away and westward bound Far above the clouds she'll fly Where the morning rain don't fall And the sun always shines She'll be flying o'er my home In about three hours timePickin' up the pieces of my sweet shattered dream I wonder how the old folks are tonight Her name was Ann and I'll be damned if I recall her face She left me not knowin' what to do Carefree highway, let me slip away on you Carefree highway, you seen better days The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes Carefree highway, let me slip away Slip away on you Turnin' back the pages to the times I love best I wonder if she'll ever do the same Now the thing that I call livin' is just bein' satisfied With knowin' I got no one left to blame Carefree highway, I got to see you, my old flame Carefree highway, you seen better days The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes Carefree highway, let me slip away Slip away on youAt times I just don't know How you could be anything but beautiful Think that I was made for you And you were made for me And I know that I won't ever change'Cause we've been friends Through rain or shine For such a long, long time Laughing eyes and smiling face It seems so lucky just to have the right Of telling you with all my might You're beautiful tonight And I know that you will never stray'Cause you've been that way From day to day For such a long, long time And when you hold me tight How could life be anything but beautiful Think that I was made for you And you were made for meThere was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun Long before the white men and long before the wheel When the green dark forest was too silent to be real But time has no beginnings and history has no bounds As to this verdant country they came from all around They sailed upon her waterways and they walked the forests tall Built the mines, the mills and the factories for the good of us all And when the young man's fancy had turned into the spring The railroad men grew restless for to hear the hammers ring Their minds were overflowing with the visions of their day With many a fortune won and lost and many a debt to pay For they looked in the future and what did they see They saw an iron road runnin' from the sea to the sea Bringin' the goods to a young growin' land All up from the seaports and into their handsRainy day people always seem to know when it's time to call Rainy day people don't talk, they just listen till they've heard it all Rainy day lovers don't lie when they tell you they've been down like you Rainy day people don't mind if you cry on a tear or two If you get lonely, all you really need is that rainy day love Rainy day people all know there's no sorrow they can't rise above Rainy day lovers don't love any others, that would not be kind Rainy day people all know how it hangs on your peace of mind Rainy day lovers don't lie when they tell you they've been down there, too Rainy day people don't mind if you cry on a tear or two Rainy day people always seem to know when you're feeling blue High stepping strutters who land in the gutter sometime need one, too Take it or leave it or try to believe it, if you've been down too long Rainy day lovers don't hide love inside, they just pass it on Rainy day lovers don't hide love inside, they just pass it onOh, the prairie lights are burnin' bright The Chinook wind is a-movin' in Tomorrow night I'll be Alberta bound Though I've done the best I could My old luck ain't been so good And tomorrow night I'll be Alberta bound No one-eyed man could e'er forget The Rocky Mountain sunset It's a pleasure just to be Alberta bound I long to see my next of kin To know what kind of shape they're in And tomorrow night I'll be Alberta bound Alberta bound, Alberta bound It's good to be Alberta bound Alberta bound, Alberta bound It's good to be Alberta bound Alberta bound, Alberta bound It's good to be Alberta bound Alberta bound, Alberta bound It's good to be Alberta boundJust like birds of a feather We too have followed the golden sun It feels so good Knowing the watchman's gone If I give you a rose, buddy Would you please bury it in the fields I seen a rose Watching it all fold out There's a train down at the station It's come to carry my bones away Two engines on Twenty-one coaches long End to end Twenty-one coaches bend The watchman's out Kicking the bums about If I wait for the right moment You can bet I'll climb aboard unseen I've done it before I know I can do it in my sleep
