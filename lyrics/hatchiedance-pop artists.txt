Why did you do it You couldn't just laugh and walk away Yeah, how could you do it Is there any power in what I say How can I fix this I couldn't have guessed you'd even stay How could I miss this So you wanna do it over But is it ever really over And if it's never really over So you wanna do it over But is it ever really over I've been trying, but I can't get it out And I cannot help Yeah, I'm not sure about it But I'm sure you could change my mind Yeah, I'm not sure about it But I'm sure you could change my mindYou bring with you The purest blue The brightest blue Maybe you should take a lesson From the moon on how to handle Eyes on you Eyes on you But you don't call me baby anymore No, you don't call me baby anymore No, you don't call me baby anymore No, you don't call me baby anymore Sugar and spice I should've taken your advice And found the words to tell you why I'll tell you why I kiss you all the time Fall more in love each time you sigh I'll kiss you 'til I die'Til I die The brightest stars burn out the fastest But maybe we could still have lost it all Or we could outlast it all Or we could outlast it all Yeah, we could outlast it all Yeah, we could outlast it all Or we could outlast it all Or we could outlast it all Yeah, we could outlast it all Yeah, we could outlast it allFeels like I waited on you for how long I don't know Oh, it's not like me to wait on something for so long Yeah, I know Oh babe, I'm backwards and I don't feel good Oh, you can go and run away Oh yeah, I'm backwards and I feel stupid I'm watching you back away I just wanted more from you And what did you do I opened the door for you And we couldn't move And you could be the bad guy, I could be the bad guy Anyway you wanna try, it doesn't make it feel right It's funny like that And we can talk all night, get into another fight Tell me all our lies, didn't mean to make me cry What a way to react Maybe next time we can work this out But my head and heart are tangled up for nowYou don't have to speak out loud You can say it in your sleep Just come see me in my dreams No wonder I'm smiling in my sleep Tell me if you could decide What you could provide Wanna know your insides With no time left to hide Do you still believe in fate Great love still awaits Or is it really too late No time to escape You don't have to speak out loud You can say it in your sleep Just come see me in my dreams No wonder I'm smiling in my sleep I dream of keepin' you confined No one else is all mine Put our differences aside Two worlds could collide Baby, I'm a piece of glass, I shatter so fast Don't know how long I'll last Is one day too much to ask It's gettin' high I've been barely sleepin'Sleepin'It's creepin'It's gettin' high We've been barely speakin'Believing It's worth keepin'But I know you wanna try I can feel it in your sigh Yeah, I know you wanna try I can feel it in your sigh It's gettin' high Don't know where this is leadin'Repeatin'The reasons It's gettin' high Yeah, I don't know this feelin'This feelin'It's creepin'You and me, we were destined to fall apart Can you believe it's been three years since the start You couldn’t be any cooler if you tried Said you wouldn't see nobody but you lied And I'm not gonna fight No I’m not gonna fight You and me, we were destined to be the ones But we couldn't see we were flying close to the sun And it didn't take too much time for our wings to melt Guess it's true what they say, that some things are felt If I could kiss you one more time Would it make everything alright Or would it just make me a liar I didn't wanna end tonight, like a dream I didn't wanna end the dream I didn't wanna end the dream Never thought I would kiss you without a blush Always thought you would miss me too much to rush Didn't take you too long to forget all about us Should I have let you be any more than a stupid crush Well now I know I’m right Yeah now I know I’m rightThis enchanted This enchanted, this enchanted Sometimes I'm too close to just let go When others leave it all behind Next time, I should learn to just let go But then you take some more and lie It shouldn't have to be so hard I shouldn't have to hold your hand You shouldn't have to break my heart You shouldn't have to, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah It's washing over me This enchanted, this enchanted Your image is all I see This enchanted, this enchanted This enchanted My eyes were closed from the get-go It seemed too high to climb I try to run away from the echoes But they hit harder every timeNever one to light up a room on entry Figured it's part of the charm and it’s nothing to shame Bug my friends, then cry about being lonely Let Friday ruin my Saturday yet again You were the one, you were the one Who told me to run, told me to run Give it a try, get out alive But I can't be fun, you're the only one It's okay, yeah, it's okay that I do But it's okay, yeah, it’s okay that I do I get a little bit obsessed, but it’sIt's no better now you're gone It's no better on my own Even when you're gone I feel like you're the one who's won Even when I'm wrong, you act like I'm the only one Stay with me, why don't you Stay with me 'cause I'm not done I've come undone Stay with me, why won't you Stay with me, though it feels wrong You're still the one It's no better now you're gone I feel nothing and I feel numb Even when you're wrong I feel like you're the one who's won Even when I'm wrong, you act like I'm the only one Stay with me, why don't you Stay with me 'cause I'm not done I've come undone Oh, stay with me, why won't you Stay with me, though it feels wrong You're still the oneSo that's it now for summer, so long And just like that, he said, "Go on, get gone Isn’t it time you pretended you're strong "She needed something to make it feel real It could be bitter, it could be surreal Just needed something to feel So she runs with no echo Shot her own heart with her own arrow Out of the shadow and into her light Dying to show herself she's still a spark They say she runs until she starves The girl who chose to take back her heart New town for a while Who would have thought it’d take ten thousand miles No more smiling from the sidelines No longer the girl with the cynical view Think it's high time now she was her own muse Gave herself an offer she couldn't refuse
