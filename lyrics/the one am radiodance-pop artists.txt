love It brought me to youOh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh An old photo of your new lover That you discovered in a book she lent Shot in some sun-drenched piazza Or whatever in Rome or wherever it is she went There's a sly glint in her eye And you can only guess at what it might have meant There's a world without you There's a world without you Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh A new photo of your old lover That you discovered to your chagrin It's been so long since it all went sunder That you stopped wondering where she's been Her hair's changed Her clothes are strange At a party where the likes of you would never get in There's a world without you Yeah, there's a world without you There's a world without you Yeah, there's a world without you You don't want the news if you're not a part of it!Even if it's true you still fall apart if it...You don't want the news if you're not at the heart of it!Even if it's true Even if it's true You don't want the news if you're

Oh OhNo one else is on the street tonight, and you've never seen the city look so bright  you could go so far in your car and never stop, but you just keep on circling the block  home is not so far away  you've just forgotten the way  the roads all look the same to your weary eyes  the site where a car crash accidentally lies  you've got so much faith in your teardrop heart, as the seams of your seatbelt fall silently apart  you've just forgotten the wayFingers scratching blackboards Make cowards of the brave A natural reaction From the cradle to the grave Rats and bats and spiders And little things that crawl Never make me tremble I'm bothered not at all Then I saw you Something new inside of me What's this shakin'You made me shiver Cemetery midnights Walking on the dead Never seemed to matter It's all inside your head Names are only letters Mentioned on a stone And If you're going somewhere You're going it alone Then I saw you Something new inside of me What's this shakin'You made me shiverOoooh Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh I climb up on the roof while you’re still sleeping in our little bed To let out all the secrets I’ve left steeping in my weary head Down below it’s just the dogs and the ghosts Scattering into the darkness when you get too close The halo of the neon signs From here, the words turn into nothing colored lines I’m so heavy with the weight of my love Pressed up against my chest ’til it’s all I can think of Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh I climb up on the roof while you’re still sleeping in our little bed To let out all the secrets I’ve left steeping in my weary headIn the house we will make someday, we'll sleep in on sunday  the sheets and the sun's rays will close all around, wash over like ocean sounds  we'll stay in the bedroom until slanting sunlight tells us it's afternoon  won't it be sweet  we'll want for naught  all that we'll need will be all we've got  and we'll never speak of days when we'd desperately seek shelter from terrible storms, trying just to keep safe andI thought i heard your voice amid the noise out on the street  i imagined it at best, but the knot in my chest still skipped a beat  i cannot concentrate or think at all of late for the thought of you, though it's been so long since the day i found you were gone when i came to  last night, i saw your face  but something was wrong that i could not quite place  suddenly i began to realize: the eyes i did not recognize  i woke up with a start and a pounding heart, gasping for air  i thought you were a ghost, or a dream at most, but you're everywhere  was that you just then, calling meAll of the mistakes I made All the ways that I fucked up the plans I laid All the times I showed up late All the places I left when I should have stayed I know Now I know I
