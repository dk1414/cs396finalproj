Let's get down to business to defeat the Huns Did they send me daughters when I asked for sons You're the saddest bunch I ever met But you can bet before we're through Mister, I'll make a man out of you Tranquil as a forest, but on fire within Once you find your center, you are sure to win You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot And you haven't got a clue Somehow I'll make a man out of you I'm never gonna catch my breath Say goodbye to those who knew me Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym This guy's got 'em scared to death Hope he doesn't see right through meYou ask how much I need you Must I explain I need you, oh, my darling Like roses need rain You ask how long I'll love you I'll tell you true Until the twelfth of never I'll still be loving you Hold me close Never let me go Hold me close Melt my heart like April snow I'll love you Till the bluebells forget to bloom I'll love you Till the clover has lost it's perfume I'll love you Till the poets run out of rhyme Until the twelfth of never And that's a long, long time Until the twelfth of never And that's a long long time That's a long, long timeAnd they called it puppy love Oh, I guess they'll never know How the young heart really feels And why I love her so And they called it puppy love Just because we're in our teens Tell them all Please tell them it isn't fair To take away my only dream I cry each night My tears for you My tears are all in vain I hope and I pray that maybe someday You'll be back In my arms once again Someone help me Help me Help me please Is the answer up above How can I Oh, how can I tell them This is not a puppy loveGo away, little girl Go away, little girl I'm not supposed to be alone with you I know that your lips are sweet But our lips must never meet I'm dating somebody else I
