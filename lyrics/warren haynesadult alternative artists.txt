Tonight I'm gonna sleep in a good hotel A nice warm bed, if all goes well I've been out in the badlands, twenty one days Tracking my bounty down He was only a kid, maybe seventeen But he traded love away for a streak of mean Now he's tied to my saddle, with his head hung low Out on the Glory Road So all you downtown ladies, won't you down Got some gold in my saddle bags I'd trade it for a smile Let's have dinner on the devil tonight Tomorrow there'll be hell to pay Won't you come along I'll be riding on The Glory Road someday Two men painted on a midnight sky One slung low, the other riding high I wonder if anybody knows just why I had to shoot him down And now I'd lay me down to rest God bless the boy, my bullet in his chest But you can't bless me, 'cause I lost my soul Out on the Glory RoadWhiskey bottles, and brand new cars Oak tree you're in my way There's too much coke and too much smoke Look what's going on inside you Ooooh that smell Can't you smell that smell Ooooh that smell The smell of death surrounds you Angel of darkness is upon you Stuck a needle in your arm So take another toke, have a blow for your nose One more drink fool, will drown you Ooooh that smell Can't you smell that smell Ooooh that smell The smell of death surrounds you Now they call you Prince Charming Can't speak a word when you're full of 'ludes Say you'll be all right come tomorrow But tomorrow might not be here for you Ooooh that smell Can't you smell that smell Ooooh that smell The smell of death surrounds youRock on, gold dust woman Take your silver spoon and dig your grave Heartless challenge Pick your path and I'll pray Wake up in the morning See your sunrise loves to go down Lousy lovers pick their prey But they never cry out loud Did she make you cry  Make you break down Shatter your illusions of love Is it over now  Do you know how To pick up the pieces and go home Rock on, ancient queen Follow those who pale in your shadow Rulers make bad lovers Better put your kingdom up for sale Well, did she make you cry  Make you break down Shatter your illusions of love Is it over now  Do you know how To pick up the pieces and go home When you can't find the light That guides you through a cloudy day When the stars ain't shining bright And it feels like you've lost your way When those candle light of home Burn so very far away Well you got to let your soul shine Just like my daddy used to say Chorus He used to say the soulshine It's better than sunshine It's better than moonshine Damn sure better than rain Hey now people don't mind We all get this way sometimes Got to let your soul shine Shine 'til the break of day I grew up thinkin' that i had it made Gonna make it on my own Life can take the strongest man And make him feel so alone Now and then i feel a cold wind Blowin' through my aching bones I think back to what my daddy said He said, boy, in the darkness before the dawnIs it getting better  Is it still the same Will it make it easier on you Now that you got someone to blame You say one love, one life, one voice in the night One, we get to share it leaves you baby if you don't care for it Did I disappoint you leaving bad taste in your mouth You act like you never had love and you want me to go without Well, it's too late tonight to drag the past out into the light We're one, but we're not the same we carry each other Carry each other, one To come here for forgiveness, to come to raise the dead To come here to play Jesus, to all the lepers in your head Did I ask too much, more than a lot You gave me nothing, now it's all I got We're one, but not the same we hurt each other, then we do it again And you say love is the temple, love the higher law Love is the temple, love the higher law You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl And I can't be holding on to what you got All you got is hurt, when all you got is hurt And you say love is the temple, love the higher law Love is the temple, love the higher law You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl And I can't be holding on to what you got When all you got is hurtI want to go for a long walk I might need some company Someone I can relate to Someone other than me I'm tired of these conversations I keep on having in my head But it's a long way home once you've made your bed I'm sick of my shadow Want to shed my skin Sick of my shadow What a shape I'm in Sick of myself, and everything I do I'm sick of my shadow since I lost you Oh yeah so I got some problems What else is new I spend too much time in my black and white world Trying to paint it blue But we can't all be like you, dear Whit your million dollar smile Some of us don't bounce back We stay down for a while I'm sick of my shadow Want to shed my skin Sick of my shadow What a shape I'm in Sick of myself, and everything I do I'm sick of my shadow since I lost you All I need is that one shot One big lucky break I can finally wipe the slate clean Pay for all my mistakes Just let me roll 'em hot tonight Jesus I swear I'll walk away Lose this chip on my shoulder Keep my demons at bay I'm sick of my shadow Want to shed my skin Sick of my shadow What a shape I'm in Sick of myself, and everything I do I'm sick of my shadow since I lost youOh, the daydreams I can create When the moonbeam is on the snowflake And lonesome is my only friend Yeah, I feel so forsaken Like the good times are on vacation And ain't coming home again Sitting here without her I get to thinking about her You know that feeling just ain't right'Cause she's in New York City And I'm stranded in self-pity Don't you play no blues tonight'Cause your guitar will get to crying And I'll sure get to sighing From my hat down to my soul Yeah, there's a favor you can do me Don't sing no sad songs to me'Cause buddy I already know If my luck would change I'd catch myself and airplane I'd leave you and these damned old blues behind But she's in New York City And I'm stranded in self-pity Don't you sing no blues tonightTears on the inside of your face But  none on the outside No  pain could penetrate the callouses Palaces you've built from the ground floor Show only the dark side of your past So  long since you've tried To  replace the wooden mask that Hangs around your neck Like  some token of war A survivor Is what you call yourself But have you looked through The  eyes of someone else Is it me or you that's killing you, baby Is it me or you that's trying to hang on Like a bullet dancing in your breast You hide the answer And point it at my chest With your aiming eyes The same eyes that used to be my window The denier Never seeking help But has it grown too late to help yourself Everything is shiny and surrounded by light Endless rows of halos Like stars in the night Sidewalks paved with diamonds Up on hallelujah boulevard He saw it on the T.V And it looked so clean Like some enchanted island Like he stepped into a dream Now he's hell bent for glory To get to hallelujah boulevard And a soapbox preacher with His busload of faith Fueled by his religion Gonna charge through the gate And he won't slow down till he Gets to hallelujah boulevard We don't need a miracle We don't need nothing but ourselves A boy walks the streets when He should be in school Gold chains around his neck But no golden rule He says he'll do what he has to do To get to hallelujah boulevardSpots of time flash before my eyes Like ribbons of light Helplessly I try to touch them Before they disappear into the night Running fearlessly as in a dream Headlong into the wind Cool night air, blowing through our hair Moonlight dancing on your skin Do you remember How young we were or is it just me Imagining like I always do When we were once wild and free Young man yearning for days gone by Innocence once removed Familiar feeling of a front porch swing And a song‚ always soothes Spots of time like windows appear You can look out or in But you can't get to the future I regret By going through the past‚ my friend Do you remember How young we were or is it just me Imagining like I always do That we were once wild and free
