Can you feel it, see it, hear it today If you can't, then it doesn't matter anyway You will never understand it, 'cause it happens too fast And it feels so good, it's like walking on glass It's so cool, it's so hip, it's alright It's so groovy, it's outta sight You can touch it, smell it, taste it, so sweet But it makes no difference 'cause it knocks you off your feet You want it all, but you can't have it It's cryin', bleedin', lyin' on the floor So you lay down on it and you do it some more You've got to share it, so you dare it Then you bare it and you tear it You want it all, but you can't have it It's in your face, but you can't grab it It's alive, afraid, a lie, a sin It's magic, it's tragic, it's a loss, it's a win It's dark, it's moist, it's a bitter pain It's sad it happened, and it's a shameGo on and wring my neck Like when a rag gets wet A little discipline For my pet genius My head is like lettuce Go on, dig your thumbs in I cannot stop givin'I'm thirty-something Sense of security Like pockets jinglin'Suck ingenuity Down through the family tree You're perfect, yes, it's true But without me, you're only you Your menstruating heart It ain't bleedin' enough for two It's a midlife crisis It's a midlife crisisKnow it sounds funny, but I just can't stand the pain Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow Seems to me, girl, you know I've done all I can You see I begged, stole, and I borrowed, yeah Ooh, that's why I'm easy I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah That's why I'm easy I'm easy like Sunday morning I wanna be high, so high And I wanna be free to know the things I do are right I wanna be free, just me, oh, baby Oh, ooh, that's why I'm easy I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah That's why I'm easy, yeah I'm easy like Sunday morningIf you want to open the hole Just put your head down and go And step beside the piece of the circumstance You got to wash away the taste of evidence Wash it away Evidence, evidence Evidence, got a taste of evidence I didn't feel a thing You didn't mean a thing Look in the eye and testify Didn't feel a thing Anything you say, we know you're guilty Hands above your head and you won't even feel me You won't feel me I didn't feel a thing I didn't feel a thing You didn't mean a thing Look in the eye and testify Didn't feel a thing about disasters, fires, floods and killer bees about the N AS A shuttle falling in the sea about starvation and the food that Live Aid bought about disease, baby Rock, Hudson, rock, yeah!It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it about the gamblers and the pushers and the freaks about the smack and crack and whack that hits the streets about the welfare of all you boys and girls about you people cause we're out to save the world Yeah!It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do itWe were so happy Things worked out better than we had planned Capital from boy, woman and man We were like ink and paper Numbers on a calculator Knew arithmetic so well Working overtime Completed what was assigned We had to multiply ourselves A bouncing little baby A shiny copper penny And he spent himself Would not listen to us But when he lost his appetite He lost his weight in friends He became a fat nickel so fast Then came puberty Exponentially Soon our boy became a millionI know the feeling, it is the real thing The essence of the truth The perfect moment, that golden moment I know you feel it too I know the feeling, it is the real thing You can't refuse the embrace, no!It's like the pattern below the skin You gotta reach out and pull it all in And you feel like you're too close But you swallow another dose The pinnacle of happiness A-fillin' up your soul You don't think you can take any more You never wanna let go To touch the roots of experience The most basic ingredients To see the unseen glitter of life And feel the dirt, grief, anger and strife Cherish the certainty of now It kills you a bit at a time Cradle the inspiration It will leave you writhin' on the floorBack and forth, I sway with the wind Resolution slips away again Right through my fingers, back into my heart Where it's out of reach and it's in the dark Sometimes I think I'm blind Or I may be just paralyzed Because the plot thickens every day And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumblin' away But I know, there's a picture beneath Indecision clouds my vision No one listens Because I'm somewhere in between My love and my agony You see, I'm somewhere in between My life is fallin' to pieces Somebody put me together Layin' face down on the ground My fingers in my ears to block the sound My eyes shut tight to avoid the sight Anticipatin' the end, losin' the will to fight Droplets of "yes" and "no" in an ocean of "maybe"From the bottom, it looks like a steep incline From the top, another downhill slope of mine But I know, the equilibrium's thereI'll be your leprechaun Shamrock or lucky charm Tap-dancing all alone Dip into the sugar bowl Sunny Side up Sunny Side up Such a lovely way to start the day Sunny Side up Sunny Side up Not the only way to fry an egg Sunny Side up Sunny Side up I am just a grain of sand on your beach With all of my heart All of my Heart A drop of rain through  your hands Rainbows will bend for me Curvy Honey bees will sting for me Stingin', stingin'I started this It's all for me What's yours is mine and mine is mine, that's plain to see So give it up I've got to have I swallow, I swallow I swallow, I swallow Be aggressive B-E aggressive B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E Be aggressive B-E aggressive B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E What someone else Would leave behind and spit it out, let go to waste I claim is mine You're my flavor  of the week I swallow, I swallow I swallow, I swallow
