Here you stand seething with guilt Silence only justifies this act of cowardice The look stapled on your face cries out for forgiveness The one thing that I cannot give Did you ever see that one person And the way they do these things And it hurts you so much it's like choking choking CH OK IN GI can give you freedom from your guilt With a flick of my wrist onto yours I can give you peace of mind with a forced smile I can give you death with the look upon my face This is your freedom in a life of fallacy With no last kiss and no regrets;You don't deserve good bye This is your freedom in a life of fallacy With no last kiss and no good bye Here you stand seething with guilt Silence only justifies this act of cowardice With a short story, the one you add to daily, you are the tragic loss No story book ending for this fairy tale of you Just the one composed with blood taken from your pen that you hold in your Lifeless handThe end result of so many meetings At late night diners with no one eating We sit in corners and sip burnt coffee Count the tiles up on the ceiling Skip this pretense and cut straight to dying Don't beg me to keep your eyes from crying You said so much Without ever parting your lips It's past 3 A.M  and I'm still far from sleep And this is a habit that I can't break You're my only company I'm skipping stones And the street lights flicker like this match in my hand The street lights flicker like this match in my hand And the street lights flicker like this match in my hand Begging to strike, begging to strike And I keep repeating but this payphone tele stopped receiving Flat out of change now, I'm sure you won't accept the charges It's all the same 'cause, by the morning, I'll be halfway to Colorado or some place like that You said so much Without ever parting your lipsOh, why can't I be what you need A new improved version of me But I'm nothing so good No, I'm nothing Just bones, a lonely ghost burning down songs Of violence, of love, and of sorrow I beg for just one more tomorrow Where you'd hold me down, fold me in Deep, deep, deep in the heart of your sins I'd break in two over you I'd break in two And each piece of me dies And only you can give the breath of life But you don't see me, you don't Here I'm pinned between darkness and light Bleached and blinded by these nights Where I'm tossing and tortured 'til dawn By you, visions of you, then you're gone The shock bleeds the red from my face When I hear someone's taken my place How could love be so thoughtless, so cruel When all, all that I did was for you I'd break in two over you I'd break in two And each piece of me dies And only you can give the breath of life But you don't see me, you don'tI'm not wishing anymore I'm not writing songs for you I sleep better in the dark I'm not doing this for you This is because of you I don't believe Tongue tied an institute of my relief You're my, my reason to shame I'm not wishing anymore I'm not writing songs for you I sleep better in the dark I'm not doing this for you This is because of you I don't believe Tongue tied an institute of my relief One wish that this is over You are all I waste today Will it tear you apart Will it Will it tear you apart I've boarded up the windows To keep the morning from intrusion I've left it on the doorknob Could you please just not disturb On days like this we find it so hard to push ourselves up and out of bed When nothing falls in favor of I have so many things I would like to explain to you But I don't know just how to Communicate I can't take this body shaking Dress and we'll begin Nights can be so violent When beds become vacant I've blown it once again This would have been the last offense and You should have been here months ago With open arms and honest face Addres full doubt you've ever felt frustration, well I'm choking on it now And it's the hardest thing for me to shake I have so many things I would like to explain to you But I don't know just how to CommunicateI've seen it spiraling, then vanish in the wind I can't tell where the land ends and the sky begins Are you acquainted with the threat of being killed Are you conversing with pigeons on the windowsill And every battle has been fought And everything I think was thought Down and down we've descended Every day keeps getting shorter As my sleeves start getting longer And the sidewalks overflow Patronize pedestrians With no sense of direction I am lost and can't ask a question I've seen it spiraling, then vanish in the wind I can't tell where the land ends and the sky begins This city truly is assaulting my senses Unkempt, unruly, devour, defenseless If poverty builds up character And spoils breed arrogance I'd rather consort with the low and the decadentEvery breath that I exhale is a sigh -Every breath that I exhale is a sigh of exhaustion How sad - this is what your life has been reduced to - a single room apartment containing no more than a mattress How sad when the strings have been removed from the blinds and all the outlets have been painted over And the television screen is streaked with blood smeared from your knuckles as you were trying to punch it out but you underestimated its strength, or maybe you just weren't trying hard enough Startled by a knock at the door you rise for the first time in two days to answer, but you can only greet the visitor with one short statement Hello my first name is Distance and I really don't care if I never wake up again Hello my name is Distance and I really don't care if I never wake up again Hello I really don't care if I never wake up again I really don't care if I never wake up againM, 4, V, T, C and H Might need to provide this number at the gate Steady pilot because I'm half afraid I can't believe you'd ask me that Of course, I don't believe in fate Would you be depressed If I attend that wedding, but only as a guest Such an unfaithful bride draped in dress Spun with threads of my regret Sing it loud to drown out the feeling When you're feeling much more odd And half as true as dishonored seamen We'll breathe Pacific and fight our demons Would you be depressed If I attend that wedding, but only as a guest Such an unfaithful bride draped in dress Spun with threads of my regret So arch your back And flip your hair Make eye contact so you know I care You know I careAll my hopes and all of my dreams Everything falling in between Seems to me that the memories Mean more to you than they do to me Through the sky and into your eyes Sew the lips right into your smile I'm okay with faking this I'll fake everything just to slip your kiss If I'm a writer, and I'm a poet I might love you, but never show it You should forget me, this is a long tour And I'll be back but, not in time for If all we speak is rational thought Everyday I pray for the sadness Eyes are black, my throat full of sickness Then I'll be listening not for long Everyday I pray for the sadness Eyes are black, my throat full of sickness Words I write, cheap and trite But they're drawn on the back of your door Surrounded by numbers that Remind of the ones beforeYou might be just what I need No I would not change a thing Been dreaming of this so long But we only exist in this song The thing is, I'm not worth the sorrow And if you come and meet me tomorrow I will hold you down, fold you in Deep, deep, deep in the fiction we live I break in two over you I break in two And if a piece of you dies Autumn, I will bring you back to life Of course I see you I do
