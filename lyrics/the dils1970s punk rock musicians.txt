I hate the rich They should dig a ditch I hate the rich Got a life without a hitch, life without a hitch I hate the rich, I don't want their money I hate the rich, so it ain't so funny Look at the poor, crawling on the floor Look at the poor Always wanting more Always wanting more Look at the poor, all they need is money Look at the poor, no, it ain't so funny I hate the rich Look at the poor I hate the rich I hate them allI, I wanna war, between the rich and the poor I wanna fight and know what I'm fighting for In a class war, class war Class war, class war This war, that war Class war, last war And here we are in L.A City Hall's falling down There is no escape When a class war comes to town Class war, class war Class war, class war This war, that war Class war, last war If I'm told to kill A Cuban or African There'll be a class war Right here in AmericaWell, you're so out of time It's not 1969 What you trying to be You're just a hippy You're not blank, so baby we're through With the flowers in your hair That proves there's nothing under there Peace and love for free They don't mean a thing to me You're not blank, so baby we're through The way you changed and rocked too long Summer of Love is ten years gone And knowing ten years, baby, I'll be gone But right now, right now You wanna be mellow It's just another word for yellow You say you want a peaceful boy Well, I just want to destroy You try to be different but your constantly victimized, you know deep inside that its wrong to be this despised, still you can't help but believe your to blame, your hearts aching strongly when you breathe your in pain, you keep what your feeling hidden from your family, you don’t want them knowing that you dig in your anatomy, then you fall into another dark depression, your eyes turn teary before you start the session As you hold the knife you say “this will fix it all, the new scars will never be discovered if the slits are small,” and then once again you puncture your skin One can only think what you wonder within, you have something near to help wipe the blood away, in your life this is just like any other day, you hate life you can't wait for morality, as self harm is now your escape from reality You cover up the pain, from those who’ve made you cry, it’s time to realize, that you are not alone, so put away the blade, only you can change your ways, its time to heal the wounds, there’s someone who loves you Tears stream out like a current in a river, you try to self-reflect but theres nothing in the mirror, your life just seems to crumble and fall to pieces, your questioning the purpose of life and all its reasons“why am I alive the world is better without me, I already know theres no one out there to help me”, then you remember how to take the pain away, as you think “I’ll use this razor blade on my vein today”So you line the knife up amongst all the other scars, you push it down and pull it back and make another fast, a couple minutes pass the blood is draining from your wrist, and you still haven’t asked what your gaining from this risk Instead you live the moment cus you feel your in control, that blade of steel is how you get some healing in your soul, you ignore all the blood line the knife up once again, think to yourself “life sucks” then it ends You cover up the pain, from those who’ve made you cry, it’s time to realize, that you are not alone, so put away the blade, only you can change your ways, its time to heal the wounds, there’s someone who loves you You cover up the pain, from those who’ve made you cry, it’s time to realize, that you are not alone, so put away the blade, only you can change your ways, its time to heal the wounds, there’s someone who loves you Death is a given but so is living life, I can't help directly so I give advice, when your feeling down find one to confide in, life can only brighten and the sun will just slide in, cuttings good for nothing it only makes matters worse You feel you deserve it and that’s why your glad it hurts, in the moment you may think the pain is nice, the bigger picture is the scars remain for life, the day you realize this you’ll regret ever making themHey, Mr  Big, you look so big to others Hey, Mr  Big, well I can see you're nothing You watch T V to learn the news Don't switch the station, you'll get confused When you go downtown, you're driven in your car While I take the bus--twice as long to get half as far Sneaking in at 2 A M--walking on your toes So over confident, you think that no one knows And you hate me And I hate you Hey, Mr  Big, well now I know the truth When the walls come down, I'll be there to see The look on your face when you see meI hate the rich They should dig a ditch I hate the rich Got a life without a hitch, life without a hitch I hate the rich, I don't want their money I hate the rich, so it ain't so funny Look at the poor, crawling on the floor Look at the poor Always wanting more Always wanting
