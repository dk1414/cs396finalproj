How many roads must a man walk down Before you call him a man How many seas must the white dove sail Before she sleeps in the sand Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly Before they're forever banned The answer, my friend Is blowin' in the wind The answer is blowin' in the wind Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist'Fore it is washed to the sea Yes, and how many years can some people exist Before they're allowed to be free Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head And pretend that he just doesn't see The answer, my friend Is blowin' in the wind The answer is blowin' in the wind'Twas a dark day in Dallas, November '63 A day that will live on in infamy President Kennedy was a-ridin' high Good day to be livin' and a good day to die Being led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb He said, "Wait a minute, boys, you know who I am ""Of course we do, we know who you are"Then they blew off his head while he was still in the car Shot down like a dog in broad daylight Was a matter of timing and the timing was right You got unpaid debts, we've come to collect We're gonna kill you with hatred, without any respect We'll mock you and shock you and we'll grin in your face We've already got someone here to take your place The day they blew out the brains of the king Thousands were watching, no one saw a thing It happened so quickly, so quick, by surprise Right there in front of everyone's eyes Greatest magic trick ever under the sun Perfectly executed, skillfully done Wolfman, oh Wolfman, oh Wolfman, howl Rub-a-dub-dub, it's a murder most foul Hush, little children, you'll understand The Beatles are comin', they're gonna hold your hand Slide down the banister, go get your coat Ferry 'cross the Mersey and go for the throat There's three bums comin' all dressed in rags Pick up the pieces and lower the flags I'm goin' to Woodstock, it's the Aquarian Age Then I'll go over to Altamont and sit near the stage Put your head out the window, let the good times roll There's a party going on behind the Grassy Knoll Stack up the bricks, pour the cement Don't say Dallas don't love you, Mr  President Put your foot in the tank and then step on the gas Try to make it to the triple underpass Blackface singer, whiteface clown Better not show your faces after the sun goes down Up in the red light district, like a cop on the beat Living in a nightmare on Elm Street When you're down on Deep Ellum, put your money in your shoe Don't ask what your country can do for you Cash on the barrelhead, money to burn Dealey Plaza, make a left-hand turn I'm going down to the crossroads, gonna flag a ride The place where faith, hope, and charity died Shoot him while he runs, boy, shoot him while you can See if you can shoot the invisible man Goodbye, Charlie, goodbye, Uncle Sam Frankly, Miss Scarlett, I don't give a damn What is the truth, and where did it go Ask Oswald and Ruby, they oughta know"Shut your mouth," said a wise old owl Business is business, and it's a murder most foulCome gather 'round people, wherever you roam And admit that the waters around you have grown And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone If your time to you is worth saving Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone For the times, they are a-changin'Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again And don't speak too soon, for the wheel's still in spin And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'For the loser now will be later to win For the times, they are a-changin'Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled The battle outside ragin'Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls For the times, they are a-changin'Come mothers and fathers throughout the land And don't criticize what you can't understand Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command Your old road is rapidly aging Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand For the times, they are a-changin'Once upon a time you dressed so fine Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you People call, say "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"You thought they were all a-kiddin' you You used to laugh about Everybody that was hangin' out Now you don't talk so loud Now you don't seem so proud About having to be scrounging your next meal How does it feel How does it feel To be without a home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street And now you’re gonna have to get used to it You say you never compromise With the mystery tramp, but now you realize He's not selling any alibis As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes And say, “Do you want to make a deal ""There must be some way out of here"Said the joker to the thief"There's too much confusion I can't get no relief Businessmen, they drink my wine Plowmen dig my earth None of them along the line Know what any of it is worth""No reason to get excited"The thief, he kindly spoke"There are many here among us Who feel that life is but a joke But you and I, we've been through that And this is not our fate So let us not talk falsely now The hour is getting late"All along the watchtower Princes kept the view While all the women came and went Barefoot servants too Outside, in the distance A wildcat did growl Two riders were approaching The wind began to howlWhen the rain is blowing in your face And the whole world is on your case I could offer you a warm embrace To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear And there is no one there to dry your tears I could hold you for a million years To make you feel my love I know you haven’t made your mind up yet But I would never do you wrong I’ve known it from the moment that we met No doubt in my mind where you belong I’d go hungry, I’d go black and blue I’d go crawling down the avenue There’s nothing that I wouldn’t do To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea And on the highway of regret The winds of change are blowing wild and free You ain't seen nothing like me yetPistol shots ring out in the barroom night Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall She sees the bartender in a pool of blood Cries out, “My God, they killed them all!”Here comes the story of the Hurricane The man the authorities came to blame For something that he never done Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been The champion of the world Three bodies lyin' there Does Patty see And another man named Bello Moving around mysteriously“I didn’t do it,” he says And he throws up his hands“I was only robbin' the register I hope you understand I saw them leaving,” he says, and he stops“One of us had better call up the cops”And so Patty calls the cops And they arrive on the scene With their red lights flashin'In the hot New Jersey nightWell, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe If'n you don't know by now And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe It'll never do somehow When your rooster crows at the break of dawn Look out your window and I'll be gone You're the reason I'm a-traveling on But don't think twice, it's all right And it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe The light I never knowed And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe I'm on the dark side of the road But I wish there was something you would do or say To try and make me change my mind and stay But we never did too much talking anyway But don't think twice, it's all right So it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal Like you never done before And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal I can't hear you anymore I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking down the road I once loved a woman, a child, I'm told I give her my heart but she wanted my soul But don't think twice, it's all rightHey, Mr  Tambourine Man, play a song for me I'm not sleepy, and there is no place I'm going to Hey, Mr  Tambourine Man, play a song for me In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand Vanished from my hand Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping My weariness amazes me, I am branded on my feet I have no one to meet And my ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming Hey, Mr  Tambourine Man, play a song for me I'm not sleepy, and there is no place I'm going to Hey, Mr  Tambourine Man, play a song for me In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels To be wandering I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade Into my own parade, cast your dancin' spell my way I promise to go under itJohnny's in the basement, mixin' up the medicine I'm on the pavement, thinkin' about the government The man in a trench coat, badge out, laid off Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off Look out kid, it's somethin' you did God knows when, but you're doin' it again You better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend The man in the coon-skin cap in a pig pen Wants 11 dollar bills – you only got 10 Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot Talkin' that the heat put plants in the bed, but Phone's tapped anyway Maggie says the many say They must bust in early May Orders from the D.A Look out kid, don't matter what you did Walk on your tip toes, don’t tie no bows Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose Keep a clean nose, watch the plainclothes You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows Oh, get sick, get well, hang around a ink well Hang bail, hard to tell if anything is gonna sell Try hard, get barred, get back, ride rail Get jailed, jump bail, join the Army if you fail Look out kid, you're gonna get hit By losers, cheaters, six-time users Hanging 'round the theaters Girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool Don't follow leaders, a-watch the parking meters
