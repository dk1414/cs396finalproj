I remember Ooh, how the darkness doubled I recall Lightning struck itself I was listening Listening to the rain I was hearing Hearing something else Life in the hive puckered up my night A kiss of death, the embrace of life Well, there I stand 'neath the Marquee Moon Just waiting I spoke To a man down at the tracks And I ask him How he don't go mad He said "Look here, Junior Don't you be so happy And for Heaven's sake Don't you be so sad"It was a tight toy night, streets so bright The room was so thin between my bones and skin There stood another person who was a little surprised To be face to face with a world so alive How I fell No I fell right into the arms of Venus de Milo You know it's all like some new kind of drug My senses are sharp and my hands are like gloves Broadway looked so medieval It seemed to flap, like little pages And I fell sideways laughing With a friend from many stages How we felt Not at all I fell right into the arms of Venus de Milo Suddenly, my eyes went so soft and shaky I knew there was pain, but pain is not aching Then Richie, Richie said:"Hey man, let's dress up like cops, think of what we could do"But something, something It said, "You'd better not"What I want, I want now And it's a whole lot more than "anyhow"I wanna fly, fly a fountain I wanna jump, jump, jump, a-jump on a mountain I understand all Destructive urges But it seems so perfect I see, I see no evil I get ideas, I get a notion I want a nice little boat made out of ocean I get your point, you're so sharp Getting good reactions with your evil talk I understand all Destructive urges But it seems so perfect I see, I see no evilI remember Ooh, how the darkness doubled I recall Lightning struck itself I was listening Listening to the rain I was hearing Hearing
