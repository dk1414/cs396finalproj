What if I wanted to break Laugh it all off in your face What would you do  What if I fell to the floor Couldn't take this anymore What would you do, do, do Come break me down Bury me, bury me I am finished with you What if I wanted to fight Beg for the rest of my life What would you do, do, do You say you wanted more What are you waiting for I'm not running from you, from you Come break me down Bury me, bury me I am finished with you Look in my eyes You're killin' me, killin' me All I wanted was you Walk on water Can you even see what you're fighting for Blood lust and a holy war Listen up, hear the patriot shout:"Times are changing"In the end, the choice was clear Take a shot in the face of fear Fist up in the firing line Times are changing Do you believe that you can walk on water Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight Look at the sky, see a dying star A white lie, sets a man on fire Making love with the devil hurts Times are changing A thin line, the whole truth The far right, the left view Breaking all those promises made Times are changingNo matter how many times that you told me You wanted to leave No matter how many breaths that you took You still couldn't breathe No matter how many nights that you'd lie wide awake To the sound of the poison rain Where did you go Where did you go Where did you go As the days go by, the night's on fire Tell me, would you kill to save a life Tell me, would you kill to prove you're right Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn This hurricane's chasing us all underground No matter how many deaths that I die I will never forget No matter how many lives I live I will never regret There is a fire inside of this heart And a riot about to explode into flames Where is your God Where is your God Where is your God We burned and we bled, we try to forget But the memories left are still haunting The walls that we built from bottles and pills We swallow until we're not talking I, I am a man on fire You, a violent desire What a dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove Don't know why we still hide what we've beco-o-ome Do you wanna cross the line We're runnin' out of time A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove Started a stranger, a lover in danger The edge of a knife The face of an angel, the heart of a ghost Was it a dream I, I am a man on fire You, a violent desireA warning to the people The good and the evil This is war To the soldier, the civilian The martyr, the victim This is war It's the moment of truth and the moment to lie The moment to live and the moment to die The moment to fight, the moment to fight To fight, to fight, to fight To the right, to the left We will fight to the death To the edge of the Earth It's a brave new world From the last to the first To the right, to the left We will fight to the death To the edge of the Earth It's a brave new world It's a brave new worldOh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh-oh Oh, oh, oh Into the night Desperate and broken The sound of a fight Father has spoken Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh We were the kings and queens of promise We were the victims of ourselves Maybe the children of a lesser God Between heaven and hell Heaven and hell Into your eyes Hopeless and taken We stole our new lives Through blood and name In defense of our dreams In defense of our dreams You are insane, my desire A violent daydream, love, love You are crazy, a perfect liar Said you'd save me, love, love I knew the moment I looked into your eyes I'd have to swallow all your lies I never said that I would be your lover I never said that I would be your friend I never said that I would take no other, be your lover Never said You are insane, my desire A dangerous game, love, love You are crazy, perfect liar Simply save me, love, love I knew the moment I looked into your eyes I'd have to swallow all your liesI don't remember the moment I tried to forget I lost myself, is it better not said Now I'm closer to the edge It was a thousand to one and a million to two Time to go down in flames and I'm taking you Closer to the edge No, I'm not saying I'm sorry One day maybe we'll meet again No, I'm not saying I'm sorry One day maybe we'll meet again No, no, no, no Can you imagine a time when the truth ran free The birth of a sun, the death of a dream Closer to the edge This never ending story Paid for with pride and faith We all fall short of glory Lost in our fateLie awake in bed at night And think about your life Do you want to be different Try to let go of the truth The battles of your youth'Cause this is just a game It's a beautiful lie It's a perfect denial Such a beautiful lie to believe in So beautiful, beautiful it makes me It's time to forget about the past To wash away what happened last Hide behind an empty face Don't ask too much, just say'Cause this is just a game It's a beautiful lie It's a perfect denial Such a beautiful lie to believe in So beautiful, beautiful it makes meHe's a stranger to some and a vision to none He can never get enough, get enough of the world For a fortune, he'd quit But it's hard to admit how it ends and begins On his face is a map of the world A map of the world On his face is a map of the world A map of the world From yesterday, it's coming From yesterday, the fear From yesterday, it calls him But he doesn't want to read the message here On a mountain he sits, not of gold, but of shit Through the blood, he can learn, see the life that he took From a council of one, he'll decide when he's done With the innocent On his face is a map of the world A map of the world On his face is a map of the world A map of the world
