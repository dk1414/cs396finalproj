Tight sweater and a pony tail Will you guess her age when she comes back stage The hoodlums bite their nailsWhat did you learn at school today  The minute the teacher turns away How many times were you truly intrigued  Is boredom a symptom of mental fatigue  When have you ever been top of the class  What will you do when you're out on your arse  What are your prospects of doing quite well  And what will you have at the very last bell  You can't bear another's beauty, you can't emulate a grace You can't filch another's mystery, occupy another's space You can't do another's duty, or take a special place In another person's history when they've sunk without a trace What's the reward for being a berk  Thick as a plank and looking for work What do you think of the Welfare State  What have they handed you on a plate  Have you considered how lucky you are  What do you think of the system so far  Aren't you endowed with the patience of Job  Don't you feel ready to conquer the globe  You can't steal another's thunder, you can't fill a great divide You can't steer another's fancy, you can't change another's side Not undo another's blunder nor pretend another's pride You can't offer

glad to be so inclined What a waste  What a waste!But the world don't mind I could be a lawyer with stratagems and ruses I could be a doctor with poultices and bruises I could be a writer with a growing reputation I could be the ticket-man at Fulham Broadway station I could be the catalyst that sparks the revolution I could be an inmate in a long-term institution I could lead to wide extremes, I could do or die I could yawn and be withdrawn and watch them gallop by
