I close my eyes Only for a moment and the moment's gone All my dreams Pass before my eyes, a curiosity Dust in the wind All they are is dust in the wind Same old song Just a drop of water in an endless sea All we do Crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see Dust in the wind All we are is dust in the wind Ohh-oh-ah Now, don't hang on Nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky It slips away And all your money won't another minute buyCarry on, my wayward son There'll be peace when you are done Lay your weary head to rest Don't you cry no more Once I rose above the noise and confusion Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion I was soaring ever higher But I flew too high Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man Though my mind could think, I still was a mad man I hear the voices when I'm dreaming I can hear them say Carry on, my wayward son There'll be peace when you are done Lay your weary head to rest Don't you cry no more Masquerading as a man with a reason My charade is the event of the season And if I claim to be a wise man, well It surely means that I don't know On a stormy sea of moving emotion Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean I set a course for winds of fortune But I hear the voices sayI'm woven in a fantasy I can't believe the things I see The path that I have chosen now Has led me to a wall And with each passing day I feel a little more like something dear was lost It rises now before me A dark and silent barrier between All I am And all that I would ever want to be It's just a travesty Towering Marking off the boundaries my spirit Would erase To pass beyond is what I seek I fear that I may be too weak And those are few who've seen it through To glimpse the other side The promised land is waiting Like a maiden that is soon to be a brideI close my eyes Only for a moment and the moment's gone All my dreams Pass before my eyes, a curiosity Dust in the wind All they are is dust in the wind Same old song Just a drop of water in an endless sea All we do Crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see Dust in the wind All we are is dust in the wind Ohh-oh-ah Now, don't hang on Nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky It slips away And all your money won't another minute buyCarry on, my wayward son There'll be peace when you are done Lay your weary head to rest Don't you cry no more Once I rose above the noise
