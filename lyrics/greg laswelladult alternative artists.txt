to make it out And we all thought everyone was going to make it out And so we all walked around in the yard We all walked around in the yard And everyone was gonna make it out I don’t know about our edges But my god how we all talked them down While the royal empress spread her arms out Arresting miserly the sun And we all thought everyone was going to make it out And we all thought everyone was going to make it out And so we all walked around in the yard And we all walked around in the yard And everyone was gonna make it out And one of us got up way too fast And his heart gave out just like that And the other one, he never had a chanceYou say the sky is green I don't know what you mean Your lies were always clear but I don't mind No, I don't mind, I don't mind Go on and take everything

that only you can solve I dreamt that you are not a hypochondriac at all So I tried my best and went right back to sleep I dreamt that you are funny And that the joke is on you I dreamt that you are sunburned And that gravity has no effect on you So I tossed and turned and tried my best to sleep I dreamt that you hate your excuses And that you are last in line I dreamt that you wake up before noon And that you take your precious time So I tossed and turned and tried my best to sleep
