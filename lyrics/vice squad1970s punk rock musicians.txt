ignore Much more pain for us all to endure One day your factories and laboratories Will be burned and you'll be brought to your knees Then you'll find out what it's really like When someone slowly ends your life In factory farms across the country Millions waiting to be freed You say that they lack human feelings This battered flesh on which we feedStumbling through the rubble My head's in a spin I hear them fighting the war that no one can win I'm too young to die Too late to live As politicians do the thing no god can forgive Time has come for us to die No memories left to cry No chance of a rebirth for the last rockers on Earth Hadn't any chance when they dropped their bomb And left us to burn in this molten tomb While we stand in the glow of radiation They wanna ruin the whole of creation Time has come for us to die No memories left to cry No chance of a rebirth for the last rockers on Earth Wandering around dreamin' of anarchy All we ever wanted was to be free Our music was our only joy But the governments want to search and destroy Stumbling through the rubble My head's in a spin I hear them fighting the war that no one can win I'm too young to die Too late to live As politicians do the thing no god can forgiveA fistful of dollars, a nuclear warhead A few dollars more, arms galore A fistful of dollars gotta win the arms race They'd kill us all for a few dollars A

ego Fuel economy out the window A fistful of dollars, a nuclear warhead A few dollars more, arms galore A fistful of dollars gotta win the arms race They'd kill us all for a few dollars History and heritage, they haven't got Though that doesn't mean a lot They pride themselves on their wild west past Would be cowboys to the lastWords that taunt, a face that sneers Is it envy or is it fear What gives you the right to criticise When you lead such useless lives Upright citizen The law is always on your side You're never stuck for a place to hide As time goes by your vision goes You can't see past the end of your nose Corrupting your children, telling lies Complacent cowards, wasting your lives You've got freedom of speech and nothing to say Put your trust in politicians and believe you're safe Say you're respectable, put on your disguise When faced with the truth you close your eyes There are millions of you and more will follow Make sure we never have a better tomorrowElements of
