 Visions, dreams of passion And all the while I think of you A very strange reaction The more I see, the more I do Baby!Ticket to ride, white line highway Tell all your friends, they can go my way Pay your toll, sell your soul Pound-for-pound costs more than gold The longer you stay, the more you pay My white lines, go a long way Either up your nose or through your vein With nothing to gain except killing your brain Higher, baby Get higher, baby!Get higher, baby!And don't ever come down  Beat Street Breakdown, rrrrhaa!Beat Street, the king of the beat You see him rockin' that beat from across the street And huh-huh, Beat Street is a lesson, too Because ah, you can't let the streets beat you Uh!Well, a picture can express a thousand words To describe all the beauty of life you give And if the world was yours to do over I know you'd paint a better place to live Where the colors would swirl And the boys and girls can grow in peace and harmony And where murals stand on walls so grand As far as the eyes are able to see, ha I never knew art till I saw your face And there'll never be one to take your place'Cause each and every time you touch a spraypaint can Michaelangelo's soul controls your hands Then serenades of blue and red And the beauty of the rainbow fills your head Crescendo colors playin' tunes Man why oh why you'd have to die so soon Ashes to ashes and dust to dust Where the good die young is all thy must'Cause as life must live death must die And the tears shall fall from the living eye Huh, teardrops fall for the state of mind Of the beautiful lady that you left behind In love and alone, but now you're dead And she still can't get you out of her head, huh More tears fall for all you've done Tried to be a good father to your only son But now who's gonna make sure that he's fed Put a shirt on his back and a roof over head Tell me who's gonna dream the impossible dream Of the beautiful cities and the islands and streams When your works of art brought into being All that the ghetto stopped you from seeing Bums on the sidewalk, garbage in the street Abandoned buildings, bricks of concrete The ladies on the corner are sellin' that body And everybody wants a part in that party I'm hangin' out tough rockin' late at night Runnin wild in the town of the neon lights You either play some ball or stand in the hall Huh, you gotta make somethin' out of nothin' at all I'm sittin' in the classroom learnin' the rules And it says you can't do graffiti in school That can't be wrong in the hallowed hall So my notebook turned into a big wall The heart of a lion and the courage of three And the mind of a man much wiser than me You're the soul of the brother who won't come back Who died in my arms on the railroad track'Cause I'm caught in a rat race lookin' for my own space It gotta be a better place for you and me There's pie in the sky and a eye for a eye Some people gotta die just to be free You search for justice and what do you find You find just us on the unemployment line You find just us sweatin' from dawn to dusk There's no justice, it's, huh, just us Still life urban masterpiece Your trademark was written on trains and walls A million dollar gift only God released Huh, and yet you got killed for nothin' at all So after this there'll be no more hard time No more bad times and no more pain No more chump change, none of that bull Just movies, museums and the hall of fame So all you hip-hops, get on up And let's take it to the top where we belong Cause the age of the Beat Street wave is here Everybody let's sing along, now come on And say hooo Say hooo And to let me know I'm rockin' the microphone Everybody say Ramon Ramon Rrrrhaa Chrous:Step, step, step, step, step off Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh Step, step, step, step, step off Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh-huh Step, step, step, step, step off Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft I was sittin' on the corner just a-wastin' my time When I realised I was the king of the rhyme I got on the microphone and what do you see Huh, the rest was my legacy I was born to be the king of the be-bop swing To have stallions and medallions, big diamond rings I own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold Because rap is the game that I control I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer Because I made rap somethin' people wanted to hear See, before my reign, it was the same old same"To the bop with the bop", that street-talk game So if you ever, let me make this clear If you ever think that we're steppin' out of here You ever think you're gettin' up, down, around or in Huh huh, you better think again, my friend Because the door is closed and we're in town And the only place you can go is dowwwwwwwwwwn Survival, only the strong can survive It's called survival, only the strong can survive It's called survival, in order to stay alive It's called survival, survival, survival, survival They smile in your face and they talk behind your back And when you get the story, it's never exact Some say, they're your friends but they really are not Because they are only out to try and get what you've got Survival, only the strong can survive It's called survival, only the strong can survive It's called survival, in order to stay alive It's called survival, survival, survival, survival In jail they got a game and they call it survival They run it down to you on your first arrival They tell you what you can and what you cannot do So if you ever go to jail, watch your "mm-mm"It's called survival, only the strong can survive It's called survival, only the strong can survive It's called survival, in order to stay alive It's called survival, survival, survival,

Brothers stand together and let the whole world see Our brother Jesse Jackson go down in history So vote Vote Vote Everybody get up and vote See Ronald Reagan speakin' on T VSmilin like everything's fine and dandy Sounded real good when he tried to give a pep talk To over 30 million poor people like me How can he say that we gotta stick it out When his belly is full and his future is sunny I

man called Scorpio The one that's seen and never heard But, all my sons just running their mouth So, it's time for daddy to speak his words You see, the biggest problem about all the M Cs Is I look good and they are ugly While they always gettin' together saying I'm not cool Their girls are out being my fools'Cause I'm the first attractive exotic male To walk around town with beads in his hair To be stopped on the street by the people I meet Saying "Where you get your beads, 'cause you look so sweet "Hey, for any fellas that think I'm gay I pull five girls right in your face I'm not saying that I'm the playboy king'Cause I didn't make it up but I made it swing I spend more on spice than I do on clothes So how could they front that they got gusto They just barely make enough for a gram of blow To start hoping and praying for their next show But a brother like me, could rock it all day I'm much smarter than that, in my own way And you know what I'm saying is an actual fact'Cause my Mercedes outside, where there's at Come on, I said come on, I said come on Rappers might be willin but they ain't able Cause I was their king straight from my cradle I screamed and hollered and shook my rattle And dreamt of defeating them all in battle There was no food in my silver spoon So I grew up hard and I grew up soon I'm a righteous king but I'm hungry too And I eat up chumps that rap like you Then I met this shark and his name was Jaws He was biting my rhymes like y'all bite yours I starting writing my rhymes the shark grew and grew But I was writing more rhymes than the shark could chew The shark got sick and then he exploded Cause he didn't realize that my rhymes was loaded They flew in the air and into the sea And the whole universe knew that the king was me Come on, I said come on, I said come on I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel3-2-11984: World
