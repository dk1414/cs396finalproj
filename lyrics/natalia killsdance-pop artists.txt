I heard the angels call again I threw myself a party Chardonnay and oxy I stopped the screams inside my head I remember when you had me Floating high like Sid and Nancy They say it's not the answer but I can't carry on Cause I got nowhere, no one, without you boy I'm done And when I'm gone, remember you're the one And just because I fight don't mean that I never learned how to love You know devils don't fly So don't expect me not to fall Devils don't fly But God we almost had it all But I got chains and you got wings You know that life ain't fair sometimes Devils don't fly But I try What's a girl to do when she's not strong When everyone that holds my hand Gets cut from all the thorns I used to put my ear against the wall To hear the screams, to hear the fall More reasons to escape it allHow you feeling, Becky  You're a fucking whore Um, you need to get your fucking dirty ass off my purse And maybe own up to it and tell me you have it Um, you're just a dumb dirty bitch You don't deserve any guy at all Fucking hate you, okay  Goodbye Controversy, uh-huh Controversy, uh-huh Controversy, uh-huh Controversy, uh-huh Controversy, uh-huh Controversy, uh-huh Controversy,
