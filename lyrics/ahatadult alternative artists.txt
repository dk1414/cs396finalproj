then box him like All Access Artillery, chemistry on a long simile Calm energy, inner G for a long history A dope fiend vs a long armed army on a long killin' spree The Smack Killer, R IP Mac Miller, you'll never see a bar killin' me Thoughts vividly, takin' apart when they finish the start literally Intimate, intricate thoughts riveting Sentences made sense for the law to sentence me You sentimental, I'm a genius and they sent a mental A produce this beat into ya career I'm instrumental What you endorse  Tell hip hop how you support Trump You wasn't talkin' my ear off at Youtube Studios how he's so much better than Hillary That's no lyin', he a Trump supporter I guess that's why he been hatin' Cortez this whole time I quit the street life cause I'm pro black and I couldn't have imagine killin' my own people Cause in actuality my soul's loyal So you votin' for Trump, was turmoil If it was up to him, y'all wouldn't have no oil So basically yo' political views is like sellin' ya soul on ya own soil This nigga Diz' always walkin' 'round talkin' 'bout "Cali I'm a real nigga."Diz', you ain't even a real...nigga And if you is, how you votin' for Trump and his agenda is to kill niggas I'ma make sure the next time they say yo' slogan it's gon feel different Sometimes you gotta go a whole round without pullin' a weapon out Sometimes you gotta sacrifice B AR S to get the message out But since it's Dizaster, I'll paint the picture of ya destiny Cause I found you the sponsors to battle Cassidy, I gave you spotlights But this extendo, give the Glock pipes My gun's so big You got to see the same nigga give you your biggest shot twice Speakin' of that battle, versus Cassidy I let us know you ain't real dawg Cause you choked an opportunities that real niggas would kill for You known for battlin' nerds, cause facin' the streets is nothin' fun Which explains why you was thirsty to battle Jin but you duckin' Rum Now I can say I battled Dizaster, even got a lil' fame off of him Just know I made it here by myself, that's why I say my name at the end Sike  Y'all thought I was done 'Til one run through ya chest Tell Loso and Drugz they gotta see me next time they come to the west What I hated all these years is ya lack of substance Millions of views about ya fabricated gats you bustin' and straps you clutchin'Fuck rap, nigga let's make a pact in public Instead of you gettin' gassed off ya trashy subjects I challenge you to be a man and stand for somethin'And that's the difference from when niggas put that up in they bars And the feelin' of when you hearin' nigga really cut from the cloth Smoov niggaYou from Nutty Blocc, I'm from a nutty block, our life is different No, I don't gang bang but ironically my writing's cryptic I put in work for years, my path was paved with obstacles If the east show y'all niggas love it's because I made it possible The fade is logical, but I'd rather put this blade inside of you If I'm showin' favoritism it'll send yo u to your favorite hospital I know you been shot before, the bullets still in you Them niggas play wit' yo' life, I'll talk to yo' bullets like, "Aye, y'all gettin' new neighbors tonight."This stainless steel will point at your brain and peel Fuck yo' last battle you'll be in front of a saint  for real I don't gang bang, just thought I'd remind him nigga The only Nutty Blocc I know is a condom nigga But fuck these bars, this might seem crazy at first But I was touched, when I met this old lady at church She was 63, her grandson was 2, I wasn't even tryin' to bother somethin'She held him up to me and said, "The street life took his father from him He was killed in a drive-by and ever since lil' man been cryin' at night He just got off work and was on his way to buyin' a bike."See the murder was never solved but believe me, the streets be listenin'Nobody came forward but rumors sayin' a nigga named "Geechi" did it See you glorify bustin' guns, and brag about the niggas you killed But you never spit a bar 'bout how you live with the guilt But you rap now, you blowin' up, I get it, you hot But when you look in a mirror you see the faces of niggas you shot You had a choice nigga, takin' the other path is what he wish he did You got initiated cause yo' father didn't take initiative Listen Geech', I'll gun butt you til you got missin' teeth The shit'll flow from under a Beanie like Chris & Neef I'm in disbelief, I'll hit you wit' this left until your life is ended But if you heard, "Vicci's bars" then you know I gotta right  for bitches I've been givin' shots for years, this a look for you but you don't see it sadly I'm providing a way out of Compton for this bitch like Venus daddy What do you mean exactly You give fans the real side of L.A

Bar God!This is a gang angle versus a gang of angles, the thang will bang you You'll be wit' a gang of angels, I'll maim and tame you Orangutan you, the flame will stain you A big rope go over ya neck, I'll Dana Dane you I'm not playin', the Glock's sprayin' til you stop standin'They told me to get Gotti and Gotti got got, god damn it Knife in ya neck, watch you leak, what a beautiful death
