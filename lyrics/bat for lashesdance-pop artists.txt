You say that they've all left you behind Your heart broke when the party died Drape your arms around me and softly say"Can we dance upon the tables again "When your smile is so wide and your heels are so high You can't cry Get your glad rags on and let's sing along To that lonely song You're the train that crashed my heart You're the glitter in the dark Ooh, Laura, you're more than a superstar And in this horror show I've got to tell you so Ooh, Laura, you're more than a superstar You say that you're stuck in a pale blue dream And your tears feel hot on my bed sheets Drape your arms around me and softly say"Can we dance upon the tables again "Daniel, when I first saw you I knew that you had a flame in your heart And under wild blue skies Marble movie skies I found a home in your eyes And we'd never be apart And when the fires came The smell of cinders and rain Perfumed almost everything We laughed and laughed and laughed And in the golden-blue Car you took me to The darkest place you knew And set fire to my heart When I run in the dark, Daniel Into a place that's lost, Daniel Under a sheet of rain in my heart, Daniel I dream of homeSee her in blue eyes Numb and shining In the face of strangers In the city lights Grey is climbing Cupid’s diving And I know that she's come To spend the night I see her in every place I go Sunday love is so cold Even though I’m falling apart I want Sunday love in my heart See her in blue eyes Still and shining In lonely lovers On bed sheets white Grey shapes sliding I've been pining She's in my bedroom Now I can't fightWe walked arm in arm But I didn't feel his touch A desire I'd first tried to hide That tingling inside was gone And when he asked me"Do you still love me "I had to look away I didn't want to tell him That my heart grows colder with each day When you've loved so long that the thrill is gone And your kisses at night are replaced with tears And when your dreams are on a train to trainwreck town Then I ask you now, "What's a girl to do "He said he'd take me away That we'd work things out And I didn't want to tell him But it was then I had to say Over the times we've shared It's all blackened out And my bat-lightning heart wants to fly awayAre you my family Can I stay with you a while Can I stop off in your bed tonight I can make you smile In the morning I'll make you breakfast In the evening I'll warm the bed And I'll always be happy to kiss you Promise I'll never get sad'Til the siren come calling, calling It's driving me evil, evil Momma was a heartbreaker Loved you the same way I do But I've got so much wickedness and sin My name is Pearl And I love you the best way I know how My blonde curls slice through your heart When the sirens come calling It won't be long Until you're runningTomorrow you will ask me if I do And all of the sorrow will drop away Like dew from a flower in bloom When you say "I do"When you say "I do"Tomorrow you will take me for your bride And all of the grey skies will blow away With forever that I feel inside When you say "I do"When you say "I do"When you say "I do"Never see the big church steeple when I call you on the phone Never feel the rush of angels, when we stay up late alone Never whisper you a great love story, only scream and cry and moan But you're a good man, but you're a good man I keep telling myself to just let go Oh, let go of the one who took all your gold I get home and there's a love note waiting But only he is here tonight And the words, the promises you're making Only echo all his lies And for every sweet nothing you whisper Why is goodbye my reply 'Cause you're a good man, 'cause you're a good man I keep telling myself to just let go There was someone that I knew before A heart from the past that I cannot forget I let him take all my gold, and hurt me so bad But now for you, I have nothing left of all my gold A ghost from the past has turned my heart black Am I ever gonna let him go  And get my gold back And today I was a dead girl walking, city light burnt through the tears Heard you say my name and get to talking about the love and all the fear And you saw all the pain I was holding, and yet still you'd hold me near'Cause you're a good man, 'cause you're a good man I keep telling myself to just let goLover, when you don't lay with me I'm a huntress for a husband lost at sea If I had you here, braid our hair together I'd be boy and you'd be girl, beautiful Calling moon and moon Shoot that big, bad hand It'll track me to your door And I won't see you no more When this wild world Is a big bad hand Pushing on my back Do you understand  When I get home Been in the jungle Where's my bear to lick me clean  Feed my soul milk and honey Calling moon and moon Shoot that big, bad hand It'll track me to your door And I won't see you no more I won't see you no moreMeasuring the distance between you and I Finding the location inside You being alive while I'm alive Within the dusty desert sky It’s hard to get high with you And not go low I've waited so long to Take it slow Desert man Desert man Love is a nowhere land Desert man Desert man Love is a desert man, man Measuring the vastness of pastel blue Measuring the sadness I see in you You take me to that nowhere land Pull me in with your both your hands And just to love is all I can do to understand It’s hard to get high with you And not go low I've waited so long to Take it slow Desert man Desert man Your love is a nowhere land Desert man Desert man Your love is a nowhere landThere's a tear in my lover's eyes He's at my window, it's a gloomy night Said he dreamt of God's search light It remembered his name Lifts his hand gently to my face Through the promise of wedding lace And I feel his dark embrace As my baby, he cries I'm falling in love I'm falling like a star from above And I finally found my pot of gold And now I can see just what my heart can hold But what does it mean The bad things that I've seen He saw angels at his bedroom door And a body on a checkered floor There was lightning in his black leather And it struck out his name No more tears, baby, please don't cry I tried to tell him everything is fine Cross my heart and hope to die I won't say goodbye
