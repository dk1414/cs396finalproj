Maybe it's just the way That God made me this dayMy best friend's always later She just moves with the weather She guides me with her patience And we breathe in together Some mystics call it wisdom When we move with the weather So change me with your nature But don't lose me forever Teaching all the kids and the other kids So they'll know, so they'll glow Solid gold Teaching all the kids and the other kids So they'll know, so they'll glow Solid gold My best friend's always later She just moves with the weather Regardless of the day Can we just take it together The path is not determined When we move with the weather Don't tell me of your concepts I need love that's foreverBaby, now let's go, drive me away Get your body back to the rock of the fray Over the West Coast, find me a way I'm not a rhinestone cowboy today Trippin' on changa, passin' away Add a little chop, can't savour the taste Losing your anger, red in the face Everybody else get out of my way Oh, na-na, na-na, oh, na-na, na-na Oh, na-na, na-na, oh Oh, na-na, na-na, oh, na-na, na-na Oh, na-na, na-na, oh Oh, na-na, na-na, oh, na-na, na-na Oh, na-na, na-na, oh Oh, na-na, na-na, oh, na-na, na-na Oh, na-na, na-na, oh Here we stand and here we fall Go ahead, we need a wrecking ball It'll be wreckin' ya Here we stand and here we fall Go ahead, we need a wrecking ball It'll be wreckin' ya I wish we could've came to some solution Through all the conflict, find a resolution But now we're sitting in this empty room and You're pushin' me aside Maybe if we'd have come to some agreement A conversation, deeper meanin'But now it's like you're leavin' me for dead We're finally out of time When you say Both of us just have to learn the hard way I sit here for hours, beggin' you to stay Since you're leavin' me, I'll never bе the same When you say Both of us just havе to learn the hard way I sit here for hours, beggin' you to stay Since you're leavin' me, I'll never be the same I know I can't be the only one Out here searchin' for the only one Someone to wipe away the stain Under the rain Always had my fear of losin' you Wish we could change our path and make it through Don't know if we could ever change We'll never change When we only cared about the fall There was no way to know that we would get here now Too early to stay worried about us all Before we knew what we were both about And now we're stuck in holdin', everything is frozen We're fakin' safe and sound But I can't keep pickin' up each time you call If everything I say just tears us down You're all that I want You're all that I need And if it hurts, baby I don't want it You're all that I want You're all that I need And if it hurts, baby I don't want it I'm learnin', baby, if we keep on burnin'No, I can't leave you, the world will keep on turnin' But I'm thinkin' lately what's so concernin'Soon as I leave you, I just keep on hurtin'Face in to creation Imagination will release your soul as it Fades out when you're too down Getting wasted, lost in worlds of doubt Never be led down a path you don't choose I'll say it again till I'm turning blue, no, no regrets Gotta make the moves that feel right for you Yeah, give it up, give it up It's time to start believing in you, star Everybody holds you down Nobody wants your star to flourish too far Singing it, singing it now Never pretend you're less than perfect Face in to creation Imagination will release your soul as it Fades out whеn you're too down Getting wasted, lost in worlds of doubt Shimmеring golden, dream life all night Seventeen open doors to insight Stereo, five times five minds a glow Thunder cat godlike friend of mine Don't see the magic design She's alright, trippin' out coldOn a night like tonight you saved my life Red and green wet shoes slip on refracted lights Running faster than my legs can take me Shouting louder than my lungs allow me Wide as the rivers run Still got time for someone Be my embrace now Be my embrace now Wide as the rivers run Still got time for someone Be my embrace now Be my embrace now Light a match, bring the flame over to your eye Slipping past, you won't see me before you die Breaking down our sleep, my head's still aching This war is killing you and all around me Wide as the rivers run Still got time for someone Be my embrace now Be my embrace now Wide as the rivers run Still got time for someone Be my embrace now Be my embrace nowAlright, yeah, go, peace when I get going Chameleon keeps me a keep going The pyramid tells me a sweet song Chameleon keeps me a keep going Peak and rock away, lean and walk away Do you wanna stay  Do you love, I say Peak and rock away, lean and walk away Do you wanna stay  Do you love, I say Come to the flicker of the sun with me Can you come to the centre of the sun with me Saying we can rock with the rhythm wise We can rock with the rhythm wise We can rock with the rhythm wise We can rock, rock, rock I hear your footsteps walking to my door Knock-a, knock-a, knock-a, bangin' loud I hear your footsteps walking to my door Knock-a, knock-a, knockin' on the floor Eyo
