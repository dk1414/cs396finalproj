Monster, how should I feel Creatures lie here Looking through the window Monster, how should I feel Creatures lie here Looking through the window I'm not afraid of the dark But I'm afraid of my heart And I'm afraid that everything is gonna fall apart Always afraid that things will never get better I went from writing down rhymes To typing suicide letters Diagnosed with paranoia You can check my prescription I'm a manic depressive One of my many conditions I'm not a prophet though I say it But I'm seeing a vision My life, it was beyond it On a one-way collision If ignorance is bliss Then I'm devoid of any sorrows Cause I don't wanna know the outcome Of today or tomorrow I just wanna hide inside my own private Hell How can I ever get to Heaven When so many angels fell I'm just a human being I'm just only being human With eternity and judgement From another always looming It's a wonder that I made it With these voices in my head With all these monsters at my window Staring at me in my bedLike, stuff started coming out, and at the time I thought it was pee  I didn't know it was squirt until I got into porn  But the whole time I just thought I was peeing I was cumming, but pee was coming out Usually when I'm playing with my clit or I have a vibrator Or I'm getting fucked really hard, I can squirt Or having some  fantasy in my head Or The sins of the flesh a fascination with death While suffocating ya breath it's torture mixed With sex I wanna get you undressed and lick the blood from ya chest And everything I request I know be keepin' ya wet My sadomasochistic baby dressed in leather and lace You're far from a fucking lady but you're sweet to the taste You love it when I tie you down and put the gun in your face And every time we get together could be our final embrace I'm on some other kinda level when I got you in bed It's like you're fiendin' for the semen when you're givin' me head The liquid pouring out your veins stain these white sheets red Your eyes rolling back, it's like you're one with the dead Can't wait to see you in that see-through Fuck until your pussy bleed, that's how we do You wanna taste pain and make the blood rain Bustin' nuts and bustin' veins until you scream my motherfuckin' nameThe trouble with the curve is the swerve they throw The means to the end is the hurt to grow The betrayal from another who's trust ya know All the emotions kept hid that you don't wanna show How many times has the sharp pain hit ya The knife in your back Someone always out to get ya You turn around just to see familiar faces Then all of a sudden took the unfamiliar places I thought I knew ya We was tight, we was best friends Concealed things Sheep's clothing you was dressed in Held out your hands Blood stains while I bled out Defying til the end but you won't never get the red out I always had your back You always went behind mine I always had a minute You could never find time I'd take a bullet for ya You could put that in a quote You'd pull the trigger Call it suicide, and sign the noteGive up my soul to hell, and tell heaven I did my best One love for family, the juggalos and fuck the rest I'm tired of all these snakes and demon leeches on the vein I've bled enough and now these bitches 'bout to feel my pain You know you name the haters bitter with a point of view Pussy motherfuckers talking shit but never had a clue Come with your attitude, cocksucker fuck your life I tie you to a chair and make you watch me fuck your wife I'm just the type to catch you slippin' like a bar of soap I catch you while you're sleeping fast and then I slit your throat I watch you bleed and gargle, choking for your last breath Then close the wound apply some pressure to delay your death See what it means  Your whole existance don't mean shit to me It ain't nothing but time to kill to make you history And all you had to do was keep your fucking trap closed But now your got your hands folded, clutched onto a single rose Just close your eyes Say your last good byes Get down on your knees Dry them eyes bitch and make your peace Jamie not a hater, if I was it ain't no killing me I live forever, never die, surviving off the infamy Miss me with that everybody wants me dead same ol'And switch my hatchet to a target hanging off my cable If you criticize my fashion, you a faggot like Tim Gunn I'm a juggalo scrub, established since day one So kill the hater, replicator, dissing with a foul tongue Take my magic marker and blacken his fucking left lung With my box-cutter I'm'a cut his eyes wide And put broken pieces of mirror replacing both his eyes Got a demon inside, that's been along for the ride Since the release of my first L P back in '95 Ever since that day, I've been embracing the hate And basically not giving a fuck, what none of y'all say So fuck y'all bitches, black flowers up on your casket You get what you deserve, burn in hell hating bastardI suffer from depression Complete depression Had it my whole life I have had it so bad that uh I've had anxiety Been diagnosed with major depression My O CD, which was in control, exploded Lots of phobias, lots of fears Anxiety, panic attacks I had depression before, I didn't know depression could be so bad Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders Everything around me closing in, it's starts to grow colder It's like I'm sitting on death row and waitin' for conclusion Shits real fucked up, my brain's filled with much confusion Do you know what it is to sit a 3 A MWith a gun pressed to your temple on your knees prayin'Or in the bathroom, on the floor, a handful of pills'Cause the fuckin' rent's due and you can't pay bills Have you ever felt the cold grip of death in your heart I'm talkin' rips right in your cavity and pulls it apart Ten motherfuckin' seconds just from ending this shit Flames rising from the actions that your about to commit Have you ever stopped your car somewhere far from everything Sat a half an hour, just thinkin' of a better way To put your soul to rest and set your mind at ease Put the barrel in my mouth, I wanna sleep for all eternityMy word's like vermin Were certain to spread just like a plague When I preach a sermon, determine to keep the flock afraid My wicked conviction to piss in rythym on the system When I speak of murder, evisions create fictional victims I walk on the dark side, the shadows where monsters reside We're so right and I choose Jekyll over Hyde, I provide A different service in the purpose to divide on the side Of a collective fascinated by suicide The sex with broke necks, we are some complex rejects Who are molded by the system with some complex effects And we vex, that's why they fear us And judge us before they hear us And It's because we summon spirits They ain't never coming near us Maniac, monsters - all mad hate on that thinking About the darker side of life Where shadows are home and the world knows our name We all are the same here So answer the whipser, they're calling your name To welcome you home here tonight So answer the whipser, they're calling your name To welcome you home here tonightLet that country air on in And roll the window down, let's ride my friend I got nothing but time that will roll down that windin' Georgia road In search of my free soul Nowhere feel like home When you grown comfortable to being all alone In a world we know how we're incapable of letting go In search of my free soul I put this on the Bible, press it straight to vinyl A primal spiral got me hoping for a final idle Maybe Judah Michael, our gutter covenant All I know for sure is you can’t trust the government Whiskey in me seems to keep the demons busy Always searching keep me living like a gypsy So many miles from Dixie and probably for the best Constant confrontation kept me beating on my chest, I’m lost But that won’t keep a man from playing Like praying for an answer Will not keep me from paying the cost I'm putting tears in so many eyes When he dies, refers to so many lives Let that country air on in And roll the window down, let's ride my friend I got nothing but time that will roll down that windin' Georgia road In search of my free soul Nowhere feel like home When you grown comfortable to being all alone In a world we know how we're incapable of letting go In search of my free soulWe walk all alone Always on our own We walk all alone Always on our own I remember when life was a struggle It ain't all roses now but back then it was double I remember when When I ain't have no pot When you piss on the floor you stay pissed off a lot I remember when I was searchin' for answers In the house of a dealer in the arms of a dancer I remember when I thought I was finished You been down this road then give me a witness We walk all alone Always on our own Get lost on the way And sometimes need To find the way home But we walk all alone X2Is that grave too shallow Maybe, but he ain’t never gonna get out How come this graveyard has no fence around it Why put a fence up when them on the inside can’t get out And them on the outside aren’t in any hurry to get in Godforsaken left to rot an orphaned bastard child Mutated product born of incest left out in the wild A bloody bastard lies abandoned still tied to the cord Opens his eyes to see more darkness in an evil world So much pain filled with hate it shapes his simple mind Don't know how don't know why no sense of days no sense of time All he knows is what he sees and that's the beast of fame Rippin' flesh kill to survive embedded in his fuckin' brain Raised by the woods provided goods enough for sure survival No way to read but in his hands he totes a tattered Bible He doesn't have a name but in his soul's just pure conviction He knows there's more like him and they gon' pay for his affliction There ain't gon' be no sequel This here is inbred evil Everybody must die, everybody must die Everybody must die, everybody must There ain't gon' be no sequel This here is inbred evil Everybody must die, everybody must die Everybody must die, everybody must The bottom of this bottle's gettin' closer, but I'm miles away Too much thinking going on, but not a lot to say I've done some praying but my soul, nah, it can't be saved I know exactly where it's headed but I'm not afraid Committed evil but commitment always lost on me Pent up emotions, lost my mind when I lost my homie It took its toll, cut too deep for these scars to heal And so I locked it all away, forgot how to feel Thought I'd found the answer, life it played a different tune Death it took her from me, snatched the way she gone too soon And that's the shit that turn me cold, and when my light faded I'm still alive and I'm still kickin' but it all seems jaded Fucked up relationships, rhe king is striking love to matches Soaked in gasoline and burned away on every mattress And yes I know that burned you up, I know I did you wrong That's why the only thing to do is leave, I'm movin'And If you see her, tell her I've been gone Ain't nothin left to talk about, tell her I've moved on And tell her I've been thinkin', thinking all night long And if she ever comes around, tell her I've been gone And tell her I've moved on My hands are dirty with some things that I can't wipe away Just like some words that are said and I forgot to say They say that time can heal, but time is all that's left to kill I might end up alone but that's the hand they had to deal The easy path ain't never been the one for me to take I think sometimes I'm only happy with the shit I break I know I'm hard to love, my demons keep me in the black Sometimes I wish that I could change, but ain't no turning back That's why I roll with the heat of revenge and served up bittersweet A jealous rage that might be waitin' for me in the street To put a end to all the pain I seem to leave behind That might be why I make it easy, I ain't hard to find I wish that I could I'm say sorry for this trail of tears Apologize for wasted time and all the wasted years But that's the way I live my life, I put it in a song Yet we was just another verse and now I'm movin' on
