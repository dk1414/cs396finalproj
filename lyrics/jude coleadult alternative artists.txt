Dream town, no money down Young girls shine electric in the sun Mirror mirror, up in the sky Tell me, why should I be the lowly one Big splash, low on cash I don't know baby, and I don't care See, it comes and goes It's the highs and the lows of the hundred dollar millionaire I promised her I wouldn't stay She calls me every single day But the rain don't snow and the hurt don't show And I don't think I can let it go Madison, ooh Madison It's a long way home Madison Heartbreaker, what does it take How many times can a fool say, I forgive Before he falls into a stranger's arms And finds out what it's like to live You could say you're sorry in your sleep But your apologies are cheap But my heart feels strange, like something's changed Like, I don't think I'll be back again To Madison, ooh Madison It's a long way home Madison I'll write your name down on a pretty red balloon Give it a kiss and let it fly straight to the moon To the moon And my heart feels strange, like something's changed Like I have been born again Madison, ooh Madison It's a long way home It's a long way home To Madison, Madison To Madison, to MadisonLiven up, loose the chains It's hard to lie down in the driving rain I lost a job I thought I had My friends say, maybe that ain't so bad You gotta lose boy, to learn to win Life's just a game I'll never understand But the ride is rough And when you fall, you better get back up Take the reins by the hand And learn to fall like a man My baby called from the south of France And said, I know what you want buddy But there ain't no chance I finally found my pot of gold And what you hide mine, is yours to hold Baby darling, I'm just a man And love's just a game I'll never understand She said, the ride is rough And when you fall, you just get back up Take the reins by the hand And learn to crawl like a man Brother if you can You learn to crawl like a man, yeah Take the reins like a man If you can You gotta lose boy, to learn to win Life's just a game I'll never understand Well the ride is rough And when you fall, you just get back up Take the reins by the hand And learn to crawl like a man Brother if you can Learn to crawl like a manYeah, yeah, uh-huh Well I'm tired of the pressure So tired of the pace Just wanna grab you baby And get out of this place I got no chance of making it Working downtown Just walking slow and talking low And tired of going down, down, down Start the car, we gotta move This ain't no living, this ain't no groove It's been a long hard road Come on baby Let's drive it home Start the car We started out for paradise But this ain't no promised land This ain't no kind of living for an honest working man Well there's people dying on the streets Sure don't make the news, ooh yeah While others living up on the hill Singing the white boy blues Whoa, start the car, we gotta move This ain't no living This ain't no groove The city's rich, or dirt poor But somewhere waiting There's something more Start the car Well we're going out with dignity We're going out with style Gonna lay down that hammer baby Make our own road across the miles'Cause I can't take this town one more day Whoa, start the car, we gotta move

losers The reckless and the wild There's no more use in pretending I know I never fooled you The deepest darkness I've ever known Comes from living like I do But I swear I'm gonna knock on that gate Even if it's all in vain I'll stand outside with my mouth wide open And drink the pouring rain I know there's some good left in this world I've seen it shine in your eyes Rain down salvation And keep my faith alive The harder we fall, the closer we come To finding our hearts and the damage we've done Darling, I've held the devil's dirty hand But holding you now I know is heaven's last attempt Won't you walk beside me You know I can't make it alone Here the fields are dark and the wind is hard Hard as stone Roll out the sky Oh, and let me come home, come home I wanna come home The harder we fall, the closer we come To finding the light and the warmth of the sun All that I've ever had I've let slip through my hands But holding you now, I know is heaven Heaven pick up the phone, 'cause I know that you're home Too many words have not been said for us to be living alone Now all of the fighting, and all of the tears They don't matter now Another night falls, dark and lonely You're the only one that I can turn to If I ever needed your arms to hold me Baby, it's tonight If I ever needed your eyes to heal me Baby it's tonight come hold me close, and show me that you still care Let's take it to where it all began and start again from there'Cause there's no way out, as far as I can tell I'm walking in a world of strangers You're the only one that really knows me x2 Won't you please, please pick up the phone Ooh...Don't leave me to face this world all alone takes some timeSitting on the back porch Everybody be damned Head in your hands, no particular plans But oh, so many thoughts and dreams unheard Words are nothing but words Words are nothing but words See the little children rolling in the yard And the sun goes down until it's almost dark And hear the train cry so many miles away Another train, another day If you ever make your mind up I know you will be somebody I know part of you wants to be everybody But don't be afraid to fall, fall Mason got his, you know that he did He put his greedy eyes right over the lid And oh, the bomb went off right in his face Oh, he wears the scars with grace But if you ever make your mind up I know you will be somebody I know part of you wants to be everybody But don't be afraid to fall Afraid to fall, afraid Walking past the church You make the sign of the cross Hey God, it wouldn't cost you anything To throw some light my way You see, I'm a little low on life today A little low on life today Low on life today Low on life today Low on life today Lowlife LowlifeIt's time to greet the world Life size, open your eyes

one you're gonna cry for When you find I've gone away There's a phone booth on a corner A thousand miles from here With a thousand miles between us She could whisper in my ear But Sheila don't remember Our secret little sin No, Sheila don't remember Where my hands have been Well there's a letter in my pocket There's a stone inside my shoe There's a footprint in the yard Where a man walked on the moon Sail on wind, sail on water Roll on wheels down ancient roads This heart can only take me where the angels fear to go And Sheila don't remember The way she wasted me Or the lovers who have suffered Against her memory Yeah yeah Never knew the peace of understanding Never knew the joy of no regret How could you let me do those things to you And just forget Oh, forget No, Sheila don't remember Our secret little sin No, Sheila don't remember Where my hands have been Where my hands have been Where my hands have been Where my hands have been"Rain down mercy, for the lost and lonely child For the liars and the losers, reckless in the wild There's no use in pretending, I know I never fooled you The deepest darkness I've ever known, it comes from living like I do But I swear I'm gonna knock on that gate Even if it's all in vain I'll stand outside with my mouth wide open And drink the pouring rain I know there's some good left in this world I've seen it shine in your eyes Rain down salvation And keep my faith alive The harder we fall The closer we come To finding our hearts And the damage we've done Darling, I've held the devil's dirty hand But holding you now, I know, is heaven's last attempt Won't you walk beside me You know I can't make it alone The fields are dark, and the wind is hard Hard as stone Roll out the sky Oh, let me come home  Heaven knows what made my heart go deeper into this love I have tried to do what's right but I could use just a little help from Above'Cause all I do is dream of her through these lonely, lonely days And when I rise, I see her eyes and I think Jesus, Jesus show me the way, yeah Won't you get me through the night'Cause I'm not strong enough to win the fight If loving her ain't right Just get me through, get me through the night Before I lose my mind Caroline can see that I've been changing a little more each day And through the dark I feel a part of me drifting slowly away'Cause all I do is dream of her through these lonely, lonely days And when I rise, I see her eyes and I wish That somebody would show me the way Won't you get me through the night'Cause I'm not strong enough to win the fight If loving her ain't right Won't you get me through, get me through the night Before I lose my mind Oh yeah Won't you get me through the night'Cause I'm not strong enough to win this fight, no If loving her ain't right Won't you get me through, get me through the night Uh-huh, yeah yeah Well, if loving her ain't right Won't you get me through, get me through the night Uh-huh, yeah Oh yeah Just get me through, just get me through Uh-huh, oh yeah
