Flying and feeling the ceiling I'm barely dealing And the faces, the faintest of praises Are too revealing Such a waste of a beautiful day Someone should say It's such a waste of the only impossible, logical way in A fly-in in L A was open I wasn't hoping for a win I was hoping for freedom You couldn't beat 'em So you crumbled, you doubled your dosage You wanna go, said the inhibitor blocking the passage That thing is massive And the sky will come for you once Just sit tight until it's done The sky will come for you once Just sit tight until it's done Got so hooked on a feeling I started dealing In a stage of grief so demanding I got a stand-in Every radio buzzing, it wasn't the dream of the moment Wasn't the current that carried me, keeping me goingYou can imagine all the factions That form around high ticket attractions High on the spirit, hopped up and mystic After the flame baptism you're fearless You know the science of falling You have your calling You know the song The Magna Carta, it's underwater We left it there for the sons and the daughters One day they'll find it; they'll be reminded When we live undersea like we ought to Didn't know flying from falling Clueless, the poor thing Sad to report Didn't know losing from learning Wheels were turning You know the song This thing could go two ways Won't be another exit for days So pack a small suitcase Anything else can be easily replacedI leapt across three or four beds into your arms Where I had hidden myself somewhere in your charm Our golden handshake has been smashed into this shape It's taken magic to a primitive new place Watch them run, although it's the minimum, heroic We hunched together in one chair out on the deck In snow that froze and fell down on the modern set It looked as if I picked your name out of a hat Next thing you know you are asleep in someone's lap Watch them run, although it's the minimum, heroic We quit the room Quit so our thoughts could rest Rest them on nothing new That's when we grabbed a hold Of whatever it is we fell into Lousy with your contempt With what the majestic cannot find In the business of your lives The perception, it is wrong, mile after mile The phantom tines drinking wine from your heelsYes I know it was late We were greeting the sun, before long And you live with someone I live with somebody too, leave it there For safe keeping Wander the West Village in flames That was the custom come dawn On the water today In the shade of the sun we wrote down Another vision of us We were the challengers of the unknown"Be safe", you say Whatever the mess you are, you're mine, okay If that is the custom,  I'm down Na-na na-na na-na, na-na na-na Na-na na-na na-na na na-na-na na-na-na Na-na na-na na-na, na-na na-na Na-na na-na na-na na na-na-na na-na-na Na-na na-na na-na, na-na na-na Na-na na-na na-na na na-na-na na-na-na Na-na na-na na-na, na-na na-na Na-na na-na na-na na na-na-na na-na-naI only play for money, honey Look at what this run has done to me It has me gunning for the country Skies memory and moonless A vision copied from the bootlegs We are out of tune so mostly tuneless For a fee, I'll fight any foe For a fee, I'll take any blow I only play it cool and bruising But only when my lips are moving You've been careful here to keep the tempo Only play with money, careful Not to trigger some reversal And to live by an obscure example For a fee, I'll fight any foe For a fee, I'll stop any show I know, have an eye on you to get this right Have an eye on you to climb these heights Have an eye on you, oops, pay-per-view I had to knowYou look just like a starmaker That is not like a star And it looked good on paper That is the cruelest part So look alive, it's much cheaper The dead have expensive taste The lookalikes found their way here It's you they want to replace Yeah‚ there's room at the top Pretty cheap for the view But the vertical drop put the skyline askew Made me trip on a step‚ then I flew for awhile Falling down the stairs of your smile Falling down the stairs of your smile You look just like a starmaker That is not like a star And they look good on paper Good design takes you farWe are champions of red wine We're poured all over It's what we're known for The fine art of crossed lines Crossed for old times Like starting over Oh like the headlands Need waves to root for You're coming over You've done your research It has the force of water And we've got a lot here The steps I take back to you The steps I take back to you I think we could save lives If we don't spend them Way undercover I am not your love song Love song gone wrong I'm coming overSince they've come, I've tried to go it straight But I've got no clue how to Was gonna make it up just now, try to Come up with some high-brow move Kid gloves, and stranger loves you've known You sort it out somehow You used to chime in quietly, you sing But you're a moaner now Think of all the life we're saving Think of all the waves we're breaking Is it too late to live in your heart Too late to burn all your civilian clothes As you break into a million parts Too late to learn it   Yes, we're all elbows Conquerors at the daybreak Conquerors at the daybreak This is the world of the theater This is the world of the theaterOut on the waves Over the railing asking the crowd To send you back To stage instead of sailing away Been left behind Looking for searchlights leading the charge The mass appeal To brilliant bruisers taking the wheel And the sea was all lighters It was all lighters It's how we know now to never go back Lob a grenade I have mere seconds before the bang Wanted to keep My job as the leader of your gang Wanted the hearts Of brilliant bruisers, where do we find them Until we do We'll have to drift until we divine them And the sea was all lighters It was all lighters It's how we know now to never go backLast night I dreamt Vancouver dressed up in the ocean Last night I dreamt Victoria drowned in the ocean The ride of a lifetime The rites of spring of a lifetime The ride of a lifetime The rites of spring of a lifetime Blondes, brunettes, paper jets Blondes, brunettes, paper jets Star power, star power The king bends over to smell a flower I wanted to go home with you I wanted to stay true to the cause But look what we're living in It's war on the east coast It's war out west Oh, I don't care I don't care It's war on the east coast It's war out west Oh, I don't care I don't care
