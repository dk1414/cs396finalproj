Passenger number 24 I've got a bag of cocaine, cut my hair short We're gonna fill it up with diesel, and American scum Left a girl in Amarillo about as sweet as rum A girl in Amarillo about as sweet as rum Got a Christian name and a cross in ink God don't like it when a poor man thinks So I'm a boot-camp warrior, United States vet Got a girl in Orange County, she don't know it yet Girl in Orange County, don't know it yet Now it's four A M and I'm still a hound They dropped a mean-talking Yankee off in the last town If I were in Kentucky I'd be shootin' raccoons Stoned as a driver chasin' the moon Hopped up driver chasin' the moon Buyin' smokes for kids, and I pocket the change Grab a jelly stick of barely legal home on the range Jump on the bus as he's gunnin' the wheel Dust in the tracks, pedal to steel Dust in my tracks, pedal to steel Passenger number 24 I've got a bag of cocaine, cut my hair short We're going to fill it up with diesel, an American scum Left a girl in Amarillo about as sweet as rum A girl in Amarillo about as sweet  as rumBroken windows of a school bus Heavy rocks in angry fists And here I am with an inebriated glow While the thrill of smashing glass persists Midnight passed an hour ago We're young; we're the only ones alive Filling dark silence through the neighbourhood Gripping severed bottles like they were pocket knives I am so in love Barefoot in suburbia But when winter comes This grass will shrivel up and die We spend the weekend in his basement Order in and shut the door His mother's upstairs staring at the T V screen Just like she did the night before He makes his way toward my lips I'm pressed against a paper sky His father's upstairs ssinging to the radio And we are filled with black smoke and white lies I am so in love Standing on your carpet stains But when curfew comes I'll only have myself to blameOn the drive back home I kept my eyes tight shut Speeding cars and moving light The driveway swallowed us The house was fast asleep Speeding hearts and colored dreams I'm no good at the give and take You're filled with questions I can't reciprocate And quiet hearts are always bound to break Apart Now the tail light's out And the rain won't stop And we've been fighting with the clock But time won't wait for us Our past is all used up The gutter fills and sinks away I'm no good At the here and now That was then and I let it go somehow And restless hearts are always bound to break FreeMorning came with such a jolt That I forgot my soul at home This pick-me-up, stale coffee cup Is filling up my insides, though And here I sit on subway stains With blue pin stripe corporate charades Outside I'm sure it's magical But today I've got to get paid Little birds over the South Pacific sea Falling from the sky in perfect symmetry Well, there goes each and every one of my dreams Shattered images of who I'll never be What is summer without sunshine Who likes dancing on a straight line When all these colors fade into mine Tell me, am I black and blue It's comforting to know the day begins And it will surely end Tucked between these filthy sheets Where nightmares start Where sweet dreams end Caught in a kaleidoscope Of timely orchestrated screams Filling space with barren thoughts Motionless antipathyWhen the lights went off in Hogtown The strippers closed their eyes The arcade quarters dropped Like boiler room flies The high beams and high rollers Fishtail through the night When the lights went off in Hogtown The stars were shining bright Oh, let the good times roll From Honest Ed's Down to Cherry Road The alley cats in Cabbagetown Are licking at their wounds And knocking over garbage cans With rodents and raccoons Diplomatico's a stillframe From some old black and white When the lights went off in Hogtown The stars were shining bright Oh, let the good times roll From the Record Man Down to Cherry Road Oh, let the good times roll From Club Paradise Down to Cherry Road Now the old men have no shelf life Down at the Polish Hall They've fired up their flashlights On a sleeping disco ball Now the smart girls just got pretty And they're not going home tonight When the lights went off in Hogtown The stars were shining bright Yeah, the stars were shining bright Oh, the stars were shining brightThese things I say Come spinning out of my mouth Like they've lost their way And there's no doubt about it You heard me I shouted I think you'd prefered it That whenever you come clean I say nothing at all So what You'd left Before I had a single chance to second-guess These bittersweet diversions And late night excursions Secret perversions Well, maybe I'm naive'Cause I can't believe this And now you fill my heart with doubt You've turned me inside out But I'm not jaded And still, with all this overkill And bitterness instilled My heart's left unfulfilled But I'm not jadedCrouched down, on a rooftop In my mothers high heeled shooes I'm wondering if I will drop And fly away with you And I can smell the rain coming But I won't leave until it falls I'm gonna soak in its down pour'Till I hear my mother's calls'Cause I am playing god I am raising hell as far as I can tell I am all alone Alone in this world Alone, with you I carry Spring rain in my hair Weighted sorrow in perfect clouds Bursting in the air Wash away..  and drownOh, for the sake of a broken heart I fell for you When you fell apart Oh, for the sake of a broken man I'm gonna fix you The best I can It won't hurt I swear I am the month of May I'm gonna kiss your blues away I love to love a broken hearted man I've got a wicked pair of healing hands Cry on my shoulder You'll be just fine Cry on my shoulder Till you're mine oh mine oh mine Oh for the sake of a losing hand I'll change your luck boy I'll do what I can It won't hurt I swear I am the month of May I'm gonna kiss your blues away I love to love a broken hearted man I've got a wicked pair of healing hands Cry on my shoulder You'll be just fine Cry on my shoulder Till you're mine oh mine oh mine Oh my pathetic love Don't cry for the departed When the middle has become the end I'm just getting started I love to love a broken hearted man I've got a wicked pair of healing hands Cry on my shoulder You'll be just fine Cry on my shoulder Till you're mine oh mine oh mine Oh for the sake of a broken heart I fell for you When you fell apartI've got no one to blame, but you I'm as innocent as the truth I'm as sweet as a pea I'm as noble as a queen So don't blame it on me I've had all I can take of regret I've done all I can do to forget you So if my simple plea is beneath you Let it be I'll forgive you For what you don't see I've got no one to blame, but you I'm pure hearted So true and blue I'm as sweet as the honey From a honey bee So don't blame it on me I've got no one to blame, but you I'm naive as the seeds of truth I'm as good as gold I'm an angel I've been told So don't blame it Don't you blame it on meOh, you make my spring And winter's such a mean old thing When it's cold And I freeze While the birds and the bees Chase the golden sun in the breeze But now the birds are flying home They've got stories from down in Mexico Oh, I envy their wings'Cause I've flown in my dreams And I've seen such beautiful things From up above But I have to admit without your love I'd rather be where the sun don't shine And it rains for days at a time'Cause he's my Encinitas Rainstorm Ooh, and he gets me so fresh When he sees me staring out my window Longing to be undressed And soaking wet My hair's a mess I'm out of breath Thunder
