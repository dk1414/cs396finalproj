I walked through the door with you, the air was cold But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow And I left my scarf there at your sister's house And you've still got it in your drawer, even now Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place And I can picture it after all these days And I know it's long gone and That magic's not here no more And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all Oh, oh, oh'Causе there we arе again on that little town street You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me Wind in my hair, I was there I remember it all too well Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was'Til we were dead and gone and buried Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same After three months in the grave And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frameI walked through the door with you, the air was cold But something 'bout it felt like home somehow And I left my scarf there at your sister's house And you've still got it in your drawer, even now Oh, your sweet disposition

After three months in the grave And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frameVintage tee, brand new phone High heels on cobblestones When you are young, they assume you know nothing Sequin smile, black lipstick Sensual politics When you are young, they assume you know nothing But I knew you Dancin' in your Levi's Drunk under a streetlight, I I knew you Hand under my sweatshirt Baby, kiss it better, I And when I felt like I was an old cardigan Under someone's bed You put me on and said I was your favorite A friend to all is a friend to none Chase two girls, lose the one When you are young, they assume you know nothingI can see you standing, honey With his arms around your body Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all And it took you five whole minutes To pack us up and leave me with it Holdin' all this love out here in the hall I think I've seen this film before And I didn't like the ending You're not my homeland anymore So what am I defending now You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out I think I've seen this film before Ooh, ooh, ooh I can see you starin', honey Like he's just your understudy Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me Second, third, and hundredth chances Balancin' on breaking branches Those eyes add insult to injuryWe could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January And this is our place, we make the rules And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years Can I go where you go Can we always be this close Forever and ever, ah Take me out and take me home You're my, my, my, my lover We could let our friends crash in the living room This is our place, we make the call And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all Can I go where you go Can we always be this close Forever and ever, ah Take me out and take me home You're my, my, my, my loverI'm doing good, I'm on some new shit Been saying "yes" instead of "no"I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though I hit the ground running each night I hit the Sunday matinée You know the greatest films of all time were never made I guess you never know, never know And if you wanted me, you really should've showed And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow And it's alright now But we were something, don't you think so Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool And if my wishes came true It would've been you In my defense, I have none For never leaving well enough alone But it would've been fun If you would've been the one I have this dream you're doing cool shit Having adventures on your own You meet some woman on the internet and take her home We never painted by the numbers, baby But we were making it count You know the greatest loves of all time are over nowSalt air, and the rust on your door I never needed anything more Whispers of "Are you sure ""Never have I ever before"But I can see us lost in the memory August slipped away into a moment in time'Cause it was never mine And I can see us twisted in bedsheets August sipped away like a bottle of wine'Cause you were never mine Your back beneath the sun Wishin' I could write my name on it Will you call when you're back at school I remember thinkin' I had you But I can see us lost in the memory August slipped away into a moment in time'Cause it was never mine And I can see us twisted in bedsheets August sipped away like a bottle of wine'Cause you were never mineI don't like your little games Don't like your tilted stage The role you made me play Of the fool, no, I don't like you I don't like your perfect crime How you laugh when you lie You said the gun was mine Isn't cool, no, I don't like you But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!Ooh, look what you made me do Look what you made me do Look what you just made me do Look what you just made me Ooh, look what you made me do Look what you made me do Look what you just made me do Look what you just made me doBetty, I won't make assumptions About why you switched your homeroom, but I think it's 'cause of me Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard When I passed your house It's like I couldn't breathe You heard the rumors from Inez You can't believe a word she says Most times, but this time it was true The worst thing that I ever did Was what I did to you But if I just showed up at your party Would you have me  Would you want me Would you tell me to go fuck myself Or lead me to the garden In the garden, would you trust me If I told you it was just a summer thing I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything But I know I miss you Betty, I know where it all went wrong Your favorite song was playing From the far side of the gym I was nowhere to be found I hate the crowds, you know that Plus, I saw you dance with himYou booked the night train for a reason So you could sit there in this hurt Bustling crowds or silent sleepers You're not sure which is worse Because I dropped your hand while dancing Left you out there standing Crestfallen on the landing Champagne problems Your mom's ring in your pocket My picture in your wallet Your heart was glass, I dropped it Champagne problems You told your family for a reason You couldn't keep it in Your sister splashed out on the bottle Now no one's celebrating Dom Pérignon, you brought it No crowd of friends applauded Your hometown skeptics called it Champagne problems You had a speech, you're speechless Love slipped beyond your reaches And I couldn't give a reason Champagne problems
