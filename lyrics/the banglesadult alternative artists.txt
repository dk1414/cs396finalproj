]All the old paintings on the tomb They do the sand dance, don't you know If they move too quick They're falling down like a domino All the bazaar men by the Nile They got the money on a bet Gold crocodiles They snap their teeth on your cigarette]Foreign types with the hookah pipes say Walk like an Egyptian]The blonde waitresses take their trays They spin around and they cross the floor They've got the moves You drop your drink, then they bring you more All the school kids so sick of books They like the punk and the metal band When the buzzer rings They're walking like an EgyptianClose your eyes, give me your hand, darling Do you feel my heart beating Do you understand Do you feel the same Am I only dreaming Is this burning an eternal flame I believe it's meant to be, darling I watch you when you are sleeping You belong with me Do you feel the same Am I only dreaming Or is this burning  an eternal  flame Say my name Sun shines through the rain A whole life so lonely And then come and ease the pain I don't wanna lose this feelin', oh Say my name Sun shines through the rain A whole life so lonely And then come and ease the pain I don't wanna lose this feelin', ohSix o'clock already, I was just in the middle of a dream I was kissin' Valentino by a crystal blue Italian stream But I can't be late, 'cause then I guess I just won't get paid These are the days when you wish your bed was already made It's just another manic Monday I wish it were Sunday 'Cause that's my fun day My I don't have to run day It's just another manic Monday Have to catch an early train, got to be to work by nine And if I had an aeroplane, I still couldn't make it on time'Cause it takes me so long just to figure out what I'm gonna wear Blame it on the train, but the boss is already there It's just another manic Monday I wish it were Sunday 'Cause that's my fun day My I don't have to run day It's just another manic MondayTime, time, time See what's become of me Time, time, time See what's become of me While I looked around for my possibilities I was so hard to please Look around Leaves are brown And the sky is a hazy shade of winter Hear the Salvation Army band Down by the riverside It's bound to be a better ride than what you've got planned Carry a cup in your hand Look around Leaves are brown And the sky is a hazy shade of winter Hang onto your hopes, my friend That's an easy thing to say, but if your hopes should pass away Simply pretend That you can build them again Look around Grass is high Fields are ripe It's the springtime of my lifeOut my window The rain starts to fall and the wind blows Through an empty hall In the mirror, ooh, reflections of you In the distance I hear a sound Is that you coming around  Oh, what you gonna do  I think I should be with you A love that's overdue Oh, I think I should be with you Thought I saw you in a stranger's face Should I call you  Or should I walk away Around the corner is around the world Is that you looking at me Or am I living a dream  Woah Oh, what you gonna do  I think I should be with you A love that's overdue Oh, I think I should be with youHey there...Where you going with that load of nothing in your hand I said: Hey there...All through this green and pleasant land I'm going down to Liverpool to do nothing I'm going down to Liverpool to do nothing I'm going down to Liverpool to do nothing All the days of my life All the days of my life Hey there...Where you going with that U B40 in your hand I said: Hey there...All through this green and pleasant land I'm going down to Liverpool to do nothing I'm going down to Liverpool to do nothing I'm going down to Liverpool to do nothing All the days of my life All the days of my life Hey now Where you going with that U B40 in your hand I said: Hey now All through this green and pleasant landThe hero is exposed when His crimes are brought to the light of day Won't be feeling sorry, sorry, sorry On the judgement day Wasn't it me who said There'd be a price to pay And I won't feel bad at all When the hero takes a fall When the hero takes a fall Your mother told you stories You substitute with girls who tell you more Suddenly your sycophants are chanting Slogans at your door We're seeing through you now I saw it all before And I won't feel bad at all When the hero takes a fall When the hero takes a fall Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh Emotion is a virtue For you it is the one fatal flaw Sitting on your throne and drinking Thinking she'll return your call Every story's got an ending Look out, here it comes, here it comes And I won't feel bad at all When the hero takes a fall When the hero takes a fallDon't bother crying, don't bother calling It's all over now, no use in stalling The love once I felt I don't feel anymore for you This time I'll even open the door for you You walked out when I was down Well, now I'm well off And look, look who's coming 'round RE PE AT:Where were you when I needed ya Where were you when I wanted ya Where were you when I needed ya Where You're looking good It's hard to fight it There's no use explaining I've already decided That living with you Is worse than without you I won't spend a lifetime a-worriying about you Things get rough and you disappeared Now I'm back on my feet And look, look who is standing there RE PE ATI remember eyes that shined As they looked so hard back into mine Now it's just a memory, so I'll set you free I hear you through the wire, the words all sound like noise What happened to the fire in your voice Don't try to hide the distance, it's just too big to ignore We work it out like business, it won't work anymore I remember eyes that shined As they looked so hard back into mine Now it's just a memory, so I'll set you free Ah-ah, I'll set you free Still sometimes late at night Moonlight comes into my window I can make believe it's how it used to be We made it look so easy, you never tried to resist Somehow you stopped believing Somehow we've come to this I remember eyes that shined As they looked so hard back into mine Now it's just a memory, so I'll set you free I remember words that fell like coins into a wishing well This was never meant to be, so I'll set you free Ah-ah, I'll set you freeDa da da da Ooh, I've had sleepless nights Toss and turn Wake up burning for you to inspire So I'm gonna walk right down your street With a love that I can't hide I've got one thing on my mind, yeah I'll even sacrifice my pride'Cause I want you Oh, oh, how I wish you would be mine My pulse is weak I'm blushing brighter than a valentine So I'm gonna walk right down your street With a love that I can't hide I've got one thing on my mind, yeah I'll even sacrifice my pride'Cause I can't stop the way I feel So I keep walking, ohh'Cause I want you Walking down, down your street I'm walking down your street Walking down your street Down your street, ohhh
