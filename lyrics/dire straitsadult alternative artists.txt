It's raining in the park, but meantime South of the river, you stop, and you hold everything A band is blowing Dixie, double-four time You feel alright when you hear the music ring Well, now you step inside But you don't see too many faces Coming in out of the rain to hear the Jazz go down Competition in other places Ah, but the horns, they blowing that sound Way on down south Way on down south, London town Check out guitar George He knows all the chords Mind, it's strictly rhythm He doesn't want to make it cry or sing Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford When he gets up under the lights to play his thing And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright He can play the Honky Tonk like anything Saving it up for Friday night With the Sultans With the Sultans of Swing YeahA lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade Laying everybody low with a love song that he made Finds a streetlight, steps out of the shade Says something like, "You and me babe, how about it "Juliet says, "Hey, it's Romeo, you nearly gimme a heart attack"He's underneath the window She's singing, "Hey la, my boyfriend's back You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that Anyway, what ya gonna do about it ""Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start And I bet, when you exploded into my heart And I forget, I forget The movie song When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong Juliet"Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame Both dirty, both mean, yes and the dream was just the same And I dreamed your dream for you, and now your dream is real How can you look at me as I was just another one of your deals Well you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold You promised me everything You promised me thick and thin, yeah Now you just say, "Oh Romeo, yeah, you know I used to have a scene with him"These mist covered mountains Are a home now for me But my home is the lowlands And always will be Some day you'll return to Your valleys and your farms And you'll no longer burn To be brothers in arms Through these fields of destruction Baptisms of fire I've witnessed your suffering As the battle raged higher And though they did hurt me so bad In the fear and alarm You did not desert me My brothers in arms There's so many different worlds So many different suns And we have just one world But we live in different onesWoo-hoo Woo-hoo Here come Johnny singing oldies, goldies Be-Bop-A-Lula, baby what I say

train Where the cars they scream and slam And I don't know where I'll be tonight But I'd always tell you where I am In a screaming ring of faces I've seen her standing in the light She had a ticket for the races, yeah Just like me she was a victim of the night I put a hand upon the lever Said: "Let it rock and let it roll"I had the one arm bandit fever There was an arrow through my heart and my soul And the big wheel keep on turning Neon burning up above And I'm just high on the world Come on and take a low ride with me girl On the tunnel of love Yeah, loveAll the late night bargains have been struck Between the satin beaus and their belles Prehistoric garbage trucks Have the city to themselves Echoes and roars of dinosaurs They're all doing the monster mash And most of the taxis and most of the whores Are only taking calls for cash, mmm I don't know how it happened It all took place so quick But all I can do is hand it to you And your latest trick Well now, my door was standing open Security was laid back and lax But it was only my heart got-a broken You must have had a pass key made out of wax You played robbery with insolence And I played the blues in twelve bars down on Lovers' Lane And you never did have the intelligence to use The twelve keys hanging off of my chainA long time ago came a man on a track Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back And he put down his load Where he thought it was the best He made a home in the wilderness He built a cabin and a winter store And he plowed up the ground by the cold lake shore And the other travelers came walking down the track And they never went further, no They never went back Then came the churches, then came the schools Then came the lawyers, and then came the rules Then came the trains and the trucks with their loads And the dirty old track was the telegraph road Then came the mines, then came the ore Then there was the hard times, then there was a war Telegraph sang a song about the world outside Telegraph road got so deep and so wide Like a rolling riverBaby, I see this world has made you sad Some people can be bad The things they do, the things they say But baby, I'll wipe away those bitter tears I'll chase away those restless fears That turn your blue skies into grey Why worry, there should be laughter after pain There should be sunshine after rain These things have always been the same So why worry now Why worry now Baby, when I get down I turn to you And you make sense of what I do I know it isn't hard to say But baby, just when this world seems mean and cold Our love comes shining red and gold And all the rest is by the wayHere I am again in this mean old town And you're so far away from me And where are you when the sun go down You're so far away from me You're so far away from me You're so far I just can't see You're so far away from me You're so far away from me, alright I'm tired of being in love and being all alone When you're so far away from me I'm tired of making out on the telephone Cause you're so far away from me You're so far away from me You're so far I just can't see You're so far away from me You're so far away from me, alright And I get so tired when I have to explain When you're so far away from me See, you've been in the sun, and I've been in the rain And you're so far away from me
