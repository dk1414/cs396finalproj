I was following the, I was following the I was following the, I was following the I was following the, I was following the I was following the, I was following the I was following the pack, all swaddled in their coats With scarves of red tied 'round their throats To keep their little heads from fallin' in the snow And I turned 'round and there you go And, Michael, you would fall and turn the white snow Red as strawberries in the summertime I was following the pack, all swaddled in their coats With scarves of red tied 'round their throats To keep their little heads from fallin' in the snow And I turned 'round and there you go And, Michael, you would fall and turn the white snow Red as strawberries in the summertime I was following the pack, all swaddled in their coats With scarves of red tied 'round their throats To keep their little heads from fallin' in the snow And I turned 'round and there you go And, Michael, you would fall and turn the white snow Red as strawberries in the summertimeI was raised up believing I was somehow unique Like a snowflake distinct among snowflakes Unique in each way you'd conceive And now after some thinking, I'd say I'd rather be A functioning cog in some great machinery Serving something beyond me But I don't, I don't know what that will be I'll get back to you someday soon, you will see What's my name, what's my station Oh, just tell me what I should do I don't need to be kind to the armies of night That would do such injustice to you Or bow down and be grateful and say"Sure, take all that you see"To the men who move only in dimly lit halls and determine my future for me And I don't, I don't know who to believe I'll get back to you someday soon, you will see If I know only one thing, it's that everything that I see Of the world outside is so inconceivable Often, I barely can speak Yeah, I'm tongue-tied and dizzy And I can't keep it to myself What good is it to sing helplessness blues Why should I wait for anyone else And I know, I know you will keep me on the shelf I'll come back to you someday soon myselfThe door slammed loud and rose up a cloud of dust on us Footsteps follow down through the hollow sound, torn up And you will go to Mykonos With a vision of a gentle coast And a sun to maybe dissipate Shadows of the mess you made Pallid animals in the snow-tipped pines I find Hatching from the seed of your thin mind all night And you will go to Mykonos With a vision of a gentle coast And a sun to maybe dissipate Shadows of the mess you made Brother, you don't need to turn me away I was waiting down at the ancient gate You go Wherever you go today You go todayThird of May Light ended the night, but the song remained And I was hiding by the stair, half here Half there, past the lashing rain And as the sky would petal white, old innocent lies came to mind As we stood, congregated, at the firing line Night ended the fight, but the song remained And so I headed to the wall Turned tail to call to the new domain As if in the sight of sea, you're suddenly free But it's all the same...Oh, but I can hear you, loud in the center Aren't we made to be crowded together, like leaves Was I too slow  Did you change overnight Second son, on the other line...Now, back in our town as a castaway I'm reminded of the time it all fell in line, on the third of May As if it were designed, painted in sand to be washed away Oh, but I can hear you, loud in the center Aren't we made to be crowded together, like leaves For Richard Swift For John and Bill For every gift lifted far before its will Judee and Smith For Berman too I've met the myth hanging heavy over you I loved you long You rose to go Beneath you, songs, perfect angels in the snow So time to stage Forget reserve The type of great coronation you deserve I'm going out for a weekend I'm gonna borrow a Martin or Gibson With Either/Or and The Hex for my Bookends Carrying every text that you've given I'm gonna swim for a week in Warm American Water with dear friends Swimming high on a lea in an Eden Running all of the leads you've been leavingLie down with me my dear, lie down Under stormy night, tell nobody My brother, where do you intend to go tonight I heard that you missed your connecting flight To the Blue Ridge Mountains, over near Tennessee You're ever welcome with me any time you like Let's drive to the countryside, leave behind some green-eyed look-a-likes So no one gets worried, no So no one gets worried, no But Sean, don't get careless I'm sure it'll be fine I love you, I love you Oh, brother of mine In the quivering forest Where the shivering dog rests Our good grandfather Built a wooden nest And the river got frozen And the home got snowed in And a yellow moon glowed bright Till the morning lightSo now I am older Than my mother and father When they had their daughter Now what does that say about me Oh, how could I dream of Such a selfless and true love Could I wash my hands of Just looking out for me Oh man, what I used to be Oh man, oh my, oh me Oh man, what I used to be Oh man, oh my, oh me In dearth or in excess Both the slave and the empress Will return to the dirt, I guess Naked as when they came I wonder if I'll see Any faces above me Or just cracks in the ceiling Nobody else to blameCan I believe you Can I believe you Can I Ever know your mind Am I handing you mine Do we both confide I see it, eat through every word I sow See what you need to, do you doubt it's yours Now I’m learning the ropes Never get this close I've been wounded before Hasn't let me go It never got less strange, showing anyone just a bare face If I don’t, well, nothing will change Staying under my weather all day Can I believe you when you say I'm good I didn't need to when I wished you would No, it isn't enough Never held that much Now another way up Been a row too rough It never got less strange, showing anyone just a bare face If I don't, well, nothing will change Staying under my weather all dayThe Shrine I went down among the dust and pollen To the old stone fountain in the morning after dawn Underneath were all these pennies Fallen from the hands of children They were there and then were gone And I wonder what became of them What became of them Sunlight over me no matter what I do Apples in the summer, all cold and sweet Everyday a'passin complete I'm not one to ever pray for mercy Or to wish on pennies in the fountain or the shrine But that day, you know, I left my money And I thought of you only All that copper glowing fine And I wonder what became of you What became of you Sunlight over me no matter what I doSummer all over Blame it on timing Weakening August water Loose-eyed in morning Sunlight covered over Wading in sight of fire And we're finally aligning More than maybe I can choose Soon as I knew you All so wide open Wading inside of fire As if I just saw you Cross Second Avenue Wading in waist-high water And I love you so violent More than maybe I can do Now we're finally aligning More than maybe I can choose
