I've been jumping from the tops of buildings For the thrill of the fall ignoring sound advice And any thought of consequence My bones have shattered My pride is shattered And in the midst of this self inflicted pain I can see my beautiful rescue I'm falling more in love with every single word I withhold I'm falling more in love with every single word you say I'm falling head over heels for you I've been dancing on the tops of buildings At the top of my lungs I'm singing you a song"Don't you leave me alone"My bones were shattered My pride lay shattered Well I'll trample my pride And tell the whole world dance with me I'm falling more in love with every single word I'll withhold I'm falling more in love with every single word you say I'm falling head over heels for you Again well I'm crying out"wash my hands, these bloody hands, oh open my mouth and I'll sing"Oh, you're throwing everything you have at me Cheap shots, low blows, will you ever let it go You're so pathetic, give it a rest You're not gonna win, you're never gonna Oh, you love the sound of your own voice And the crown of death upon your head, come on You and all your royalty, on the edge of infamy You're going to taste my fist You're so good at stretching the truth Into a sugar-coated lie Everyone takes a bite I have been dining with the enemy It was a wolf in sheep's clothing Now it's so clear to me I've had enough of your games If you're not trembling, you'd better be'Cause we're gonna be the end of you I've had enough of your games I'm gonna show them who you really are I can tell you right now, it won't be prettyI got those lovesick blues And I feel it more than ever A sinking in my chest like a ship in the blue She was a drug I abused I feel a rising fever A shaking in my sleep left me broken and bruised She said, "You're just a letdown Another one of my mistakes I never loved you anyway I never did, and I never will"She said, "You're just a letdown All your friends, they feel the same I never loved you anyway I never did, and I never will"I got those lovesick blues'Cause I sold my soul to the devil She was well dressed and she knew what to do I'm painted crimson and blue She was a ruthless artist I traded my skin for cheap sex and tattoos She said, "You're just a letdown Another one of my mistakes I never loved you anyway I never did, and I never will"She said, "You're just a letdown All your friends, they feel the same I never loved you anyway I never did, and I Well I never will, I never will"Darling, are you dreaming Are you dreaming of me now Screaming, are you screaming 'Cause it's such a nightmare now There must be, must be something else waiting for you, oh There must be, must be something else waiting for you, oh I can't keep on without you I can't keep on without you Leaving, are you leaving when I need you here the most I need you more than ever All I have is your holy ghost, oh There must be, must be something else waiting for you, oh There must be, must be something else waiting for you, oh I can't keep on without you I can't keep on without you Oh, without you You paint my broken heart Like some awful piece of art And I watch my world as it falls down, around But still I pray you will come back some dayOh we could lie beneath the stars Or watch a thousand passing cars From the roof of this prison, yeah Oh we could make this moment ours And I could hold you, touch your scars I can't believe that I have you, yeah I said, you I waste myself on you I do anything for you, yeah I waste myself on you, yeah Like a feather in a hurricane That's sweeping through my brain I can't seem to find hope in this situation, love Oh so I tremble like an earthquake Your tears, a heavy rain They drown my soul in apathy like a flood, love Singing now, you I said, you I waste myself on you I do anything for you, yeah I waste myself on you, yeah You set me on fire Now we're walking on a wire baby, a wire baby You set me on fire Now we're walking on a wire baby, a wire babyI can hear their song from miles away It's carried in the wind Its melody is sung to me in miracles The sun rises over the sea When I hear their love song I don't understand From out beyond the shadows I can hear it calling me Honestly, if I'm honest with myself I've cried myself to sleep Crying out, 'Oh God, where are you Can you hear my scream way up there Through the clouds, in heaven Do you even care 'And honestly if I'm honest with myself I hate the song they sing It's like salt on an open wound But I can't get it out of my head This melody kills me It's out of key and foolish But I think I might just like it If I could just get past my pride I turn my head and look away'Cause you know it hurts to see the light of dayMy world is falling apart What a fool, I never saw it coming Oh no no And my life Is like a card house A delicate construction With no regard for the wind Everybody's changing Oh everybody's changing And I don't know No no no no How much more I can take I thought I had Everything under control I couldn't've been more wrong I thought I have My world in my hand Until I woke from this foolish dream I put so much of myself In everything else Yeah, in everything else It was a dream The scene Torn at the seams Revealing a nightmareHey, hey I could run away Run away from everything I know I know I shouldn't feel this way Because really, I gotta get away from me Is there any hope for a boy like me Is there any, any hope for me There's gotta be And yeah, well I can hear you say"Anything is possible."But my life is such a mess And we've already been through this And though we've been here before Anything is possible So many years all alone in the dark Well it's time to get out It's time to get out Hey, hey I danced away Countless nights with demons out of sight And I took to their foolish games But really, I gotta get myself out of this sceneThere's a man on the side of the road Left for dead people passing by, turn their head There's a man on the side of the road to Jericho - needs a friend Oh we all could use a little more loving, couldn't we So come on love and give your love away with me Hold nothing back like you've nothing to lose Love is all you have but you don't have a clue what it's costing you There's a man on his way to a church Avoids the eyes of a dying soul, turns his head There's a child on the side of the road to Jericho - needs a friend Oh we all could do a little more loving, wouldn't you agree So come on love and give your love away with me Hold nothing back like you've nothing to lose Love is all you have but you don't have a clue what it's costing you If loving were easy it wouldn't be love If loving were easy it wouldn't be love If loving were easy it wouldn't be love Oh will you give your love away If loving were easy it wouldn't be love If loving were easy it wouldn't be love If loving were easy it wouldn't be loveYour words hit harder than expected I couldn't sleep because my dreams were interrupted By the bittersweet fragrance of our childhood dreams Filling my heart but its a world torn apart We thought we had what no one Could ever have invincibility But a distance between you and I killed us gradually A spoonful of your sarcasm helps the pain go down But if you wanna mend my heart for a while It'll take a phone call from your side of town Now we're left with broken hearts and a handful of memories And who I am now reflects you somehow'Cause you're so a part of me It's not like were over is it It's not like we'll never be together I hate it, the way that you say "never."The snow falls here You can see the stars Where you are searching for the inspiration That we once found in every moment we shared All our deepest dreams On a train of thought That took us to the place of common ground But the stage was only set for a disappointment
