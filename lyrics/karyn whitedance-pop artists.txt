Early in the morning, I put breakfast at your table And make sure that your coffee has its sugar and cream Your eggs are over-easy, your toast done lightly All that's missing is your morning kiss that used to greet me Now you say the juice is sour, it used to be so sweet And I can't help but to wonder if you're talking 'bout me We don't talk the way we used to talk, it’s hurting so deep I’ve got my pride, I will not cry But it’s making me weak I'm not your superwoman I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down and think that everything's okay Boy, I am only human This girl needs more than occasional hugs as a token of love from you to me I fought my way through the rush hour trying to make it home just for you I want to make sure that your dinner will be waiting for you But when you get there you just tell me you’re not hungry at all You said you'd rather read the paper and you don't want to talk You like to think that I’m just crazy when I say that you've changed I’m convinced I know the problem: you don't love me the same You’re just going through the motions and you’re not being fair I've got my pride, I will not cry Still I can't help but careMmm, mmm I don't wanna be a fool, I don't wanna be a fool for love No, no, I won't, no Hey, no, ooh I know that people do go through changes, yeah But this just don't make no damn sense If we're gonna keep saying we love one another, yeah, yeah Well, then we better stop fighting and arguing'Cause baby, I've heard I'm sorry too many, many times before Now I know better It hurts to hold on to this kind of love even more No, I'm not crazy I won't be a fool, a fool for love'Cause I know I'd rather be alone than be here unhappy I'm not gonna choose, choose for you'Cause I know I'd rather be alone than be here unhappy, yeah I know it's time to go when I feel lonely When I'm laying in your arms and it don't feel right, oh'Cause every time I'm feeling up, you try to bring me down So I feel good knowing I don't need you aroundI used to think that love was so silly Something that a girl like me never dreamed of It never was for me, no, not really But there was not a guy who was special enough Until you came and made me so happy Like a child on Christmas Day I was so, so, so, so anticipating And I didn't know I could ever feel this way Love saw it Hey, love saw the change in my heart You brought me so much joy Love saw it Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy, boy, ooh Oh, you bring me joy Me joy, me joy, me joy, me joy I used to think that love was a mystery Something that a guy just could not figure out And I never had no past history Not even a clue what true love was aboutHey, baby You're driving me crazy With that special loving feeling that you give to me And I'm so proud, you want me to be your lady Now I know how it feels to live a fantasy I used to dream about love And sure that's how it was But I don't have to dream no more'Cause I, I got more than I can stand I found me a lover in another man I got you, baby, that's all I was waiting for And I love the way you love me I place no one above the one true love And I love the way you love me And baby no matter what I love the, I love the way you love Oh, baby, baby, baby I might as well face it I've fallen in too deep You have control of me Without a doubt It has to be the greatest You're every bit the man I had hoped you'd beOoh Baby, baby, baby I wanna get romantic Oh Turn the lights down It's time to get romantic Light a candle It's time to get romantic Let's be romantic Take me in your arms, caress me gently Oh, I can't get enough, ooh Thrill me, say the word, I will surrender To your poetic charm, oh'Cause when the night falls I hear seductive voices sing Romantic songs of love Let's get intimate Turn the lights down It's time to get romantic Do everything romantic now Light a candle It's time to get romantic The night has just begun, so baby, let's be romanticHappiness is when I, I think of you And when we get together and rendezvous I'll be on time, you bring the wine And when we lock the door, you'll be all mine Alone in my room Thoughts of you in my head As I wait The time is soon You'll arrive Together then We'll escape Into the night on wings of love And do the things that we once dreamed of All aboard a luxury A first class ticket to ecstasy It won't stop It don't stop Our non-stop secret rendezvous It won't stop It don't stop Our non-stop secret rendezvous Hey, hey, hey Oh, oh, ohHolding you in the moonlight, the feeling's so right I know you've been waiting Ooh, your eyes say you want me but my heart says hold on We gotta be patient, ah yeah If it's special enough, baby, why must we rush We gotta be stronger And I promise to give you my all No, it won't take too long But you gotta save your love for me Slow down so I can love you better Cherish this moment for life, oh yeah Slow down, oh, let's just share this dream together And make the magic last for always Slow down The way you touch me is so sweet, how can I deny You're what I've been missing — oh, you know you are I wanna say that I love you but you want so much more Than what I've been giving, oh babyDay after day Just thinking about you I can't wait to see your smiling face Could this be love I'm feeling for you I've never felt this way before, no I made a wish upon a shooting star And, baby, here you are Just you and me That's the way it should be My heart is waiting, it's an open door Each day I'm gonna love you more Of this I'm for sure That's the way I feel about you Bye-bye cloudy days Sunshine's here to stay Tell the world That's the way I feel about you Happy days are here Whenever you're near This is clear That's the way I feel about youIt's a special world that we're living in But we're treated like we're strangers underneath the skin Not a baby cries and I don't feel it, too'Cause he's a part of me just like I'm a part of you How much longer must we stand alone together 'Cause to live this way's a crime And we're running out of time If I had one wish we'd live as one together All over the world If I had one wish  there'd be peace forever All over the world Just one wish There's a special place deep inside our hearts There's an ancient flame burning brightly in the dark And if we listen to that higher voice inside And heed the words of love, not the words of pride No more will we fight with one another There'll be rejoicing in the streets And the winds of war will ceaseI'm unhappy'Cause I lost someone who was mine As I face the morning without him Now all I do is cry If I was more gentle and sentimental Then he'd be here with me But I took the man for granted, I was so demanding Now all I feel is misery Don't ever wanna let ya go It's hard to say goodbye I don't ever wanna leave you It's hard to say goodbye Oh, I'm still in love, baby, now I know So hard to say it So hard to tell you goodbye Is a word that I've always feared'Cause it makes me think that forever Somehow has disappeared To a haunting memory That's so strong that I can't forget Anytime I hear the phone ring I start to daydream It's you on the other line and you keep asking me why Oh, why did we ever break up Why can't we make up and give our love just one more try My whole world is falling apart Without you, I'm lost I need you, I need you right here with me
