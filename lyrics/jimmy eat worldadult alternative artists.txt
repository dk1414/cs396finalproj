I take the right pills every day And rest, clean your conscience, clear your thoughts with Speyside with your grain Clean your conscience, clear your thoughts with Speyside Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt Our hearts littering the topsoil Tune in and we can get the last call Our lives, our coal Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt Our hearts littering the topsoil Sign up, it's the picket line or the parade Our lives I'm not alone 'cause the T V's on, yeah I'm not crazy 'cause I take the right pills every day And rest, clean your conscience, clear your thoughts with Speyside with your grain Clean your conscience, clear your thoughts with Speyside Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt Our hearts littering the topsoil Tune in and we can get the last call Our lives, our coal Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt Ah, our hearts, yeah, littering the topsoil Sign up, it's the picket line or the parade Our livesI felt for sure last night that once we said goodbye No one else will know these lonely dreams No one else will know that part of me I'm still driving away and I'm sorry every day I won't always love these selfish things I won't always live not stopping It was my turn to decide I knew this was our time No one else will have me like you do No one else will have me, only you You'll sit alone forever if you wait for the right time What are you hoping for I'm here, I'm now, I'm ready Holding on tight Don't give away the end The one thing that stays mine Amazing still it seems I'll be 23 I won't always love what I'll never have I won't always live in my regretsI don't feel the way I've ever felt I know Gonna smile and not get worried I try but it shows Anyone can make what I have built and better now Anyone can find the same white pills It takes my pain away It's a lie, a kiss with open eyes And she's not breathing back Anything but bother me Never mind, these are horrid times Oh, oh, oh I can't let it bother me I never thought I'd walk away from you I did But it's a false sense of accomplishment every time I quit Anyone can see my every flaw It isn't hard Anyone can say they're above this all It takes my pain awayAre you going to live your life wondering Standing in the back, looking around Are you going to waste your time thinking How you've grown up or how you missed out Th-th-th-th-things are never going to be the way you want Where's it going to get you acting serious Th-th-th-th-things are never going to be quite what you want Even at 25, you got to start sometime I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go Now all I need is just to hear a song I know I want to always feel like part of this was mine I want to fall in love tonight Are you going to live your life standing in the back looking around Are you going to waste your time Got to make a move or you'll miss out So-so-so-so-someone's going to ask you what it's all about Stick around, nostalgia won't let you down So-so-so-so-someone's going to ask you what it's all about What you going to have to say for yourself I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go Now all I need is just to hear a song I know I want to always feel like part of this was mine I want to fall in love tonightIf you only once would let me Only just one time Then be happy with the consequence With whatever's going to happen tonight Don't think we're not serious When's it ever not The love we make is give and it's take I'm game to play along All I can say I shouldn't say Can we take a ride Get out of this place while we still have time All the best D Js are saving their slowest song for last When the dance is through, it's me and you Come on, would it really be so bad The things we think might be the same But I won't fight for more It's just not me to wear it on my sleeve Count on that for sureWell you're just across the street Looks a mile to my feet I want to go to you Funny how I'm nervous still I've always been the easy kill I guess I always will Could it be that everything goes round by chance Or only one way that it was always meant to be You kill me, you always know the perfect thing to say Hey hey, hey hey I know what I should do but I just can't walk away I can picture your face well from the bar in my hotel I wish I'd go to you I'll pick up, put down the phone Like your favorite Heatmiser song goes"It's just like being alone."Oh god, please don't tell me this has been in vain I need answers for what all the waiting I've done means You kill me, you've got some nerve but can't face your mistakes Hey hey, hey hey I know what I should do but I just can't turn awayThe first star I see may not be a star We can't do a thing but wait So let's wait for one more And the time, such clumsy time In deciding if it's time I'm careful but not sure how it goes You can lose yourself in your courage When the time we have now ends When the big hand goes round again Can you still feel the butterflies Can you still hear the last goodnight And the mindless comfort grows When I'm alone with my great plans And this is what she said gets her through it"If I don't let myself be happy now, then when If not now, when "When the time we have now ends When the big hand goes round again Can you still feel the butterflies Can you still hear the last goodnight
