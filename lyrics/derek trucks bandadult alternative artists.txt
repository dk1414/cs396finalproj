the view All of us laugh How many of us sing This sky where we live Is no place to lose your wings So love, love, love Lose your body And your mind And the bitter Taste of time All of us cry While we should be dancing This sky where we live Is no place to lose your wings So love, love, love Fly, fly away Do you remember All of us sleeping How many of us dream This sky where we live Is no place to lose your wings So love, love, loveI need your sweet inspiration I need you here on my mind every hour of the day Without your sweet inspiration The lonely hours of the night just don't go my way A man in love needs sweet inspiration And honey that's all I ask, that's all I ask from you I gotta have sweet inspiration You know there's just no telling what a satisfied man might do If I'm out in the rain baby In a bad situation I just reach back in my mind to find Sweet inspiration Sweet, oh what a power And I've got the power every hour in the day I need your sweet inspiration To go on livin' to keep on givin' this way Sweet, sweet inspiration I am my father's child Am my father's child Train that's bound for nowhere Runnin' free and wild I am my father's child The world has passed me by World has passed me by See the comin' shadows Ain't got time to cry The world has passed me by I am already free Am already free Goin' be like Christmas When the devil come for me Am already

hard to remember the first time I saw your face With the moonlight in your smile How did I wind up back where I started And I'm so glad I found you there I'm so glad I found you there Oh, I'm so glad I found you there And I'm so glad I found you thereCrash on the levee, mama Water's gonna overflow Swamp's gonna rise No boat's gonna row Now, you can train on down To Williams Point You can bust your
