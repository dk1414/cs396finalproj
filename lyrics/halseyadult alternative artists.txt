Cross my heart, hope to die To my lover, I'd never lie He said "be true," I swear I'll try In the end, it's him and I He's out his head, I'm out my mind We got that love, the crazy kind I am his, and he is mine In the end, it's him and I, him and I My '65 speeding up the P CH, a hell of a ride They don't wanna see us make it, they just wanna divide2017 Bonnie and Clyde Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah Got that kind of style everybody try to rip off YS L dress under when she takes the mink off Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her Swear we drive each other mad, she be so stubborn But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer Intense, this shit, it gets dense She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince Found you when your heart was broke I filled your cup until it overflowed Took it so far to keep you close I was afraid to leave you on your own I said I'd catch you if you fall And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all And then I got you off your knees Put you right back on your feet Just so you could take advantage of me Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me You know I'm the one who put you up there Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely Thinkin' you could live without me Thinkin' you could live without me Baby, I'm the one who put you up there I don't know why Thinkin' you could live without me Live without me Baby, I'm the one who put you up there I don't know why Uh Yeah, yeah When I was young, I fell in love We used to hold hands, man, that was enough Then we grew up, started to touch Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus I know your daddy didn't like me much And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late She used to meet me on the Eastside In the city where the sun don't set And every day, you know that we'd ride Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight We can go anywhere we want Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea Just take my hand and come with me, yeah We can do anything if we put our minds to it Take your old life, then you put a line through it My love is yours if you're willing to take it Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it So come away, starting today Start a new life together in a different place We know that love is how all these ideas came to be So baby, run away with meYour little brother never tells you but he loves you so You said your mother only smiled on her T V show You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope I'll hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise You're spilling like an overflowin' sink You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink Everything is blue His pills, his hands, his jeans And now I'm covered in the colors Pulled apart at the seams And it's blue And it's blue Everything is gray His hair, his smoke, his dreams And now he's so devoid of color He don't know what it means And he's blue And he's blueGot a boy back home in Michigan And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him So I told him that I never really liked his friends Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again There's a guy that lives in the garden state And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate So I told him that the music would be worth the wait But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I Always make the same mistakes, yeah Always make the same mistakes 'cause I'm bad at love But you can't blame me for tryin'You know I'd be lyin' sayin'You were the one That could finally fix me Lookin' at my history I'm bad at loveNow I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord, my soul to keep If I shall die before I wake I pray the Lord, my soul to take I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind They talk shit, but I love it every time And I realize I've tasted blood and it is sweet I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet I've trusted lies and trusted men Broke down and put myself back together again Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors"Come on, little lady, give us a smile"No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thingI've missed your calls for months it seems Don't realize how mean I can be'Cause I can sometimes treat the people That I love like jewelry'Cause I can change my mind each day I didn't mean to try you on But I still know your birthday And your mother's favorite song So I'm sorry to my unknown lover Sorry that I can't believe That anybody ever really Starts to fall in love with me Sorry to my unknown lover Sorry I could be so blind Didn't mean to leave you And all of the things that we had behind Ooh ooh oooh I run away when things are good And never really understood The way you laid your eyes on me In ways that no one ever could And so it seems I broke your heart My ignorance has struck again I failed to see it from the start And tore you open 'til the endI wanna start this out and say I gotta get it off my chest Got no anger, got no malice Just a little bit of regret Know nobody else will tell you So there's some things I gotta say Gonna jot it down and then get it out And then I'll be on my way No, you're not half the man you think that you are And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad I tried to help you, it just made you mad And I had no warning about who you are I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down And then ran so fucking far That you would never ever touch me again Won't see your alligator tears'Cause know I've had enough of themCross my heart, hope to die To my lover, I'd never lie He said "be true," I swear I'll try In the end, it's him and I He's out his head, I'm out my mind We got that love, the crazy kind I am his, and he is mine In the end, it's him and I, him and I My
