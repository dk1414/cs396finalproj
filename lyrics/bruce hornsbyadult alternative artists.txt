The song came and went Like the times that we spent Hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent I laughed and she'd smile It would last for awhile You don't know what you've got till you lose it all again Listen to the mandolin rain Listen to the music on the lake Oh, listen to my heart break every time she runs away Oh, listen to the banjo wind A sad song drifting low Listen to the tears roll Down my face as she turns to go A cool evening dance Listenin' to the bluegrass band takes the chill From the air until they play the last song I'll do my time Oh, keeping you off my mind but there's moments That I find, I'm not feeling so strong Listen to the mandolin rain Listen to the music on the lake Ah, listen to my heart break every time she runs away Oh, listen to the banjo wind A sad song drifting low Listen to the tears roll Down my face as she turns to goWhat's the long face, what's all the crying for Didn't you expect it when you opened your door To the man with the long coat, and the long list of victims Everybody watching knows he's the one keeping score From where she sits, everyone stands in judgment People watching as the curtain falls down See the lights do a long slow fade The show goes on, and the sad-eyed sisters go walking on Everyone watching all along The show goes on As the autumn's coming and the summer's all gone Still without you, the show goes on Some say she's alright, some say she'll never learn Some rush into things, some stand and wait their turn I've been here all along standing here all this time But you never noticed, just let the same tired flames burnWay out here, working on the docks Everyone sees the long day through But what would I do without the nights And the phone, and the chance just to talk to you Oh, what would I do now—Hey—just to talk to you A thousand miles away What I wouldn't give for only one night A little relief in sight Or someday when times weren't so tight When the day goes down on the water town—When the sun sinks low all around—That's when I know I, I need you now Yes, you're what I miss: every little kiss Every little one  Every little one Everybody here's a number, not a name But I guess that's all right with me As I sit alone after a long day In the absence of company Oh I let my mind wander—Hey, yeah—a thousand miles awayWhat's the long face, what's all the crying for Didn't you expect it when you opened your door To the man with the long coat, and the long list of victims Everybody watching knows he's the one keeping score From where she sits, everyone stands in judgment People watching as the curtain falls down See the lights do a long slow fade The show goes on, and the sad-eyed sisters go walking on Everyone watching all along The show goes on As the autumn's coming and the summer's all gone Still without you, the show goes on Some say she's alright, some say she'll never learn Some rush into things, some stand and wait their turn I've been here all along standing here all this time But you never noticed, just let the same tired flames burnI guess it's terrible But it don't feel so bad I abide and I may hold a key To being gratefully glad You smile in my face And all the time, you wanna hit replace Here's my back for stabbin'But I'll make it up I won't wait it up I won't tear you down I won't crave it up I won't stand up I won't taint it up I won't stand down When you cast me off I'll be, I'll be your cast-off Be your discarded toy I'll be, I'll be your cast-off Be your maybe sometime choice Self-loathing never felt so good And so it should I'll be your cast-off I'll be your discarded toy Be your rejection foilWhen the last rose of summer pricks my finger And the hot sun chills me to the bone When I can't hear the song for the singer And I can't tell my pillow from a stone From a stone, from a stone When the last bolt of sunshine hits the mountain And the stars start to splatter in the sky When the moon splits the southwest horizon With the scream of an eagle on the fly And I will walk alone by the black muddy river And sing me a song of my own I will walk alone by the black muddy river And sing me a song of my own, of my own Yes, of my own When it feels like the night will last forever And there's nothing left to do but count the years When the strings of my heart start to sever And stones fall from my eyes instead of tearsThere's a man working in a field Sees the rain and it's burning He's saying "This can't be real"Oh, as he sees the color of the fields turning Far away, the men too busy Getting rich to care Close their eyes And let it all out into the air Hoping nobody else would care Look out any window Look out any open door Look out any window To see what's going on in the air around you There's a man working on a boat Pulling lines from the water Just trying to stay afloat, oh Filling the nets is getting harderThere's a place A local roadside shack A poor man's Paris with parking in the back There's a girl there She knows how to unwind She don't talk much but she knows just how to act I said, "Don't tell me she don't love me The money's just a mere formality"Hey, yeah Every day, every night Something's going on, something's going on Down the road over yonder Yeah, any place, any time when I'm fading My love lies waiting Down the road tonight When I was younger All the older boys Would drive me way out past the county fair They'd laugh and point out This roadside trailer And say something wild's going on over thereStanding in line, marking time Waiting for the welfare dime'Cause they can't buy a job The man in the silk suit hurries by As he catches the poor old lady's eyes Just for fun, he says, “Get a job”That's just the way it is Some things'll never change That's just the way it is Ha, but don't you believe them Said, “Hey, little boy, you can't go where the others go'Cause you don't look like they do”Said, “Hey old man, how can you stand to think that way Did you really think about it before you made the rules ”He said “Son”That's just the way it is Some things'll never change That's just the way it is Ha, but don't you believe them Yeah
