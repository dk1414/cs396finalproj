My hands are searching for you My arms are outstretched towards you I feel you on my fingertips My tongue dances behind my lips, for you This fire runs in through my being Burning, I'm not used to seeing you I'm alive I'm alive I can feel you all around me Thickening the air I'm breathing Holding on to what I'm feeling Savoring this heart that's healing My hands float up above me And you whisper you love me And I begin to fade Into our secret place The music makes me sway The angels singing, say "We are alone with you"I am alone and they are too with youI will break into your thoughts With what's written on my heart I will break Break I'm so sick Infected with where I live Let me live without this Empty bliss Selfishness I'm so sick I'm so sick If you want more of this We can push out, sell out, die out So you'll And stay sleeping With my screaming in your itching ears I'm so sick Infected with where I live Let me live without this Empty bliss Selfishness I'm so sick I'm so sickThe question asked in order To save her life or take it The answer "No" to avoid death The answer "Yes" would make it Make it All heads are bowed in silence To remember her last sentence She answered him knowing what would happen Her last words still hanging in the air In the air"Do you believe in God "Written on the bullet Say "Yes" to pull the trigger"Do you believe in God "Written on the bullet And Cassie pulled the triggerTelling Layla's story spoken'Bout how all her bones are broken Hammers fall on all the pieces Two months in the cover creases Fully alive, more than most Ready to smile and love life Fully alive and she knows How to believe in futures All my complaints shrink to nothing I'm ashamed of all my somethings She's glad for one day of comfort Only because she has suffered Fully alive, more than most Ready to smile and love life Fully alive and she knows How to believe in futures Fully alive, more than most Ready to smile and love life Fully alive and she knows How to believe in futures Fully alive, more than most Ready to smile and love life Fully alive and she knows How to believe in futuresI love the way that your heart breaks With every injustice and deadly fate Praying it all will be new And living like it all depends on you, oh Here you are down on your knees again Trying to find air to breathe again And only surrender will help you now I love you, please see and believe again I love that you're never satisfied With face value, wisdom and happy lies You take what they say and go back and cry You're so close to me that you nearly died, oh Here you are down on your knees again Trying to find air to breathe again And only surrender will help you now I love you, please see and believe again They don't have to understand you, be still Wait and know I understand you, be still, be stillAll your twisted thoughts free flow To everlasting memories Show soul Kiss the stars with me And dread the wait for Stupid calls returning us to life We say to those who are in love It can't be true 'cause we're too young I know that's true because So long I was So in love with you So I thought A year goes by And I can't talk about it On my knees Dim lighted room Thoughts free flow try to consume Myself in this I'm not faithless Just paranoid of getting lost or that I might lose Ignorance is bliss cherish it Pretty neighborhoods You learn too much to hold Believe it not And fight the tears With pretty smiles and lies About the timesAlmost thought we'd made it home But we don't know this place at all That's enough now dry your tears It's been a long eleven years Fire Fire Fire Fire from the tongues of liars You're ashamed of where you're from Crying cause your father's drunk We can't die because we're young At least that's what we heard in a song You're ashamed at what you've done Crying cause your father's wrong Trying to be something new You'll feel that you had something to proveI saw the queen Swam out below her star on sea beneath Though I lifted up my hands to her She never lifted me Oh something's missing in me I felt it deep within me As lovers left me to bleed alone Found something sweet On the island with the Daughters of Eve But through thick and thin they've gone away And only left their grief Oh, something's missing in me I felt it deep within me As lovers left me to bleed alone Oh, something's missing in me I felt it deep within me As lovers left me to bleed alone Something's missing in me Something's missing in meI am sorry I don't mean to remember It's true that I dream less often, I'm not ashamed Of that long December Your hand's coming down again, I Close my eyes and brace myself I only noticed your face No matter what, you're gonna build my shell No matter what, you're gonna build my shell I'm falling I'm shedding my skin But it's not time I'm told I am aware Of what you mean by then I'm only ten years old Close my eyes and brace myself Only noticed your face No matter what, you're gonna build my shell No matter what, you're gonna build my shellHere I stand Empty hands Wishing my wrists were bleeding To stop the pain from the beatings, and There you stood Holding me Waiting for me to notice you But who are you You are the truth Out-screaming these lies You are the truth Saving my life The warmth of your embrace Melts my frostbitten spirit You speak the truth and I hear it The words are I love you And I have to believe in you But who are you You are the truth Out-screaming these lies You are the truth Saving my life
