beat when we walk down the street I feel a trembling in my knees And just to know you're mine until the end of time Makes my heart skip a beat You came into my life without a warning And you turned my cloudy skies from gray to blue You're my sunshine that comes up every morning Yes you are my every dream come true And my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street I feel a trembling in my knees And just to know you're mine until the end of time Makes my heart skip a beatMerry Christmas from our house to your house Merry Christmas from our kids to yours May happiness be round your Christmas

I thought the day I met you, you were meek as a lamb Just the kind to fit my dreams and plans But now the pace we're living takes the wind from my sails And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see I won't be much when you get through with me Well I'm a losing weight and a turning mighty pale Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail Well every night you drag me where the bright lights are found There ain't no way to slow you down I'm as 'bout as helpless as a leaf in a gale And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see I won't be much when you get through with me Well I'm a losing weight and a turning mighty pale Looks like I've got a tiger by the tailDown here on the farm, the weather gets messy Laying around with nothin' to do When you went away, you took my cow, Bessie I miss her, darlin', more than I miss you You took off your leg, your wig and your eye glass And you shoud have seen the look on my face I wanted to kiss, I wanted to hug you But you were scattered all over the place Where, oh, where, are you tonight Why did you leave me here all alone I searched the world over and thought I found true love You met another and  you were gone I know that you loved me, here's my way of knowing The proofs hanging out right there on the line When I see the snow and feel the wind blowing Your nighties hugging them long Johns of mine The noises you made at our supper table Your habits, my dear, were surely absurd But how many times do I have to tell you"Soup is a dish to be seen and not heard" Forever and ever I'll love you I swear by the stars up above you There never will be any other I'll love you forever and ever The sun may stop shining in heaven The salty old sea may run dry The Man in the Moon may stop smiling Oh, but I'll always be by your side Forever and ever I'll love you I swear by the stars up above you There never will be any other I'll love you forever and ever No other arms ever will hold me No other lips ever will kiss me No other heart ever will miss me I'll love you forever and ever Forever and ever I'll love you I swear by the stars up above you There never will be any other I'll love you forever and ever I'll love you forever and everMy transistor radio comes from far away And when it's night over here, over there it's-a breaking day I remember all the good times I had walking in the sand With a beautiful girl that I met made in Japan The beauty of her face was beyond my wildest dreams Like cherry blossoms blooming in the mountains in the early spring As we walked by the river and she softly took hold of my hand That's when I fell deep in love with a girl made in Japan In the dark of night we would lay on Tokyo Bay And the singing of the birds woke us up at the break of day Her smiling eyes always seemed to try to understand All the love in my heart for the girl made in Japan My transistor radio comes from far away And when it's night over here over there it's-a breaking day She cried when she said she'd been promised to another man That's when I left my heart with the girl made in Japan Yes my heart will always be with the girl made in JapanMirror mirror on the wall who's the saddest of them all But I don't have to see I know it's gotta be me Every time the wind blows at my window I rush to see if it's you at my door And the sadness fill the rooms when you're not standin' there And I wish that I could walk right through the floor Mirror mirror on the wall...Every night in dreams you torment me as I remember things I should forget And the sun comes up by and a new day's dawnin'But nothing's changed for I still love you yet Mirror mirror on the wall..
