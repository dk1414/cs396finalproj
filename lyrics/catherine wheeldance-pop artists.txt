I always thought the way you talked was neat And I dreamed that when you speak, you speak to me But you're always out of reach and i can't control my speech And I'm scared that when we meet, I'll want to touch you I want to touch you I want to touch you I want to touch you I want to touch you You're the only soul inside that makes me shake And the crazy senseless things you make me take It would really make my day if you'd only move away'Cause I'm scared that if you stay, I'll want to touch you I want to touch you I want to touch you I want to touch you But you're always out of reach and i can't control my speech And I'm scared that when we meet I'm fermenting, can't you seeLove my superstitious games Running circles round my brain When I'm left smiling I love to steal this living steam My head in someone's dream I'm tired of sleeping Call me crank, my idea Crank, so severe Crank, my conscience clear I build my canopy of steel It fulfills my sense of real A chrome protection Call me crank, my idea Crank, so severe Crank, my conscience clear It's clear In this small partition, like a prison Explode time bomb If you know where I come from Just call meI've never seen you when you're smiling It really gets under my skin You say it's easy when it's faster I still can't guess what you're after It's the colour of your skin Your skin is black metallic It's the colour of your skin Your skin is black metallic Your skin is black metallic Your skin is black metallic I think of you when you're sleeping Of all the secrets that you're keeping You can't stay all day under the covers'Cause under there you'll discover It's the colour of your skin Your skin is black metallic It's the colour of your skin Your skin is black metallic Your skin is black metallic You're turning black metallicYou're making me doubt myself This feeling I know so well Visions of naked greed Are visions I just don't need Far deep, phantom seeking, I can see The nude that broke my heart The nude that broke my heart Far from living, I can see The nude that broke my heart The nude that broke my heart The texture of moistened skin All over this skin I've been Skin that's been angel stretched No muscle or excess flesh Far deep, phantom seeking, I can see The nude that broke my heart The nude that broke my heart Far from living, I can see The nude that broke my heart The nude that broke my heart You're making me doubt myself This feeling I know so well Feeling of naked lust This feeling I love so muchSafe on the shore I've been sleeping Faced by the thoughts I've been keeping To break down the door of my life I need more texture You need to give me more texture, texture, texture You need to give me more texture So deep inside I've been dreaming In a space too confined, too concealing It's a race to remind you of days I can't find You need to give me more texture, texture, texture You need to give me more To break down the door of my life I need more texture You need to give me more You need to give me more Texture, texture, texture You need to give me more texture, textureSo make it shine No need to fade I'll make it hard on you I'll make it glow No need to show you this time I'll make it easy And I know The sunlight bleaches you It colours everything you do And I know A flower's fading far too soon So think of a time It's something to cling to Imagine a life That never escapes you Conceal it behind The colour and perfume A flower to hide A violet surprise And I know The sunlight bleaches you It colours everything you do And I know A flower's fading far too soonThere's a shark shaped fin In the water of my dreams An alligator screams from the depths there I'd swim with you there I'd swim with you there, yeah yeah In the house that I use There's a psycho on the loose He's playing with the fuse of a bomb there I could live with you there I could live with you there Bye bye long day I need to sleep so much You shine on me Too much is not enough On the sheets and pillow case In my bed for heaven's sake The devil's dancing until late in my head there But I could sleep with you there I could sleep with you there Always AlwaysSmacked up again behind the door Begging please give me some more A vein that's open for the day Feel the pulse beneath the skin And smiling as it all begins Oh where have you been Judy's staring at the sun Judy's staring at the sun Judy's fantasy has come So amplify this little one She's a volume freak She hears as much as she can see And what she sees she can't believe It's just what Judy needs a moment of release To give her peace peace peace Judy's staring at the sun Judy's staring at the sun Judy's day passed out of sight Judy will be suffering tonight She's suffering She passed by and said goodbye to him And in a rare and lucid state She said my days are unoriginal I wanna fade, fade, fadeI'm only waiting 'cause she won't care Shivers, shakes, and shallow Hide the taste that's always there I can say she makes no sense My dreams are not drawn on much'Cause she's my friend'Cause she's my friend'Cause she's my friend - oh'Cause she's my friend - oh'Cause she's my friend - oh'Cause she's my friend I found you in a garden in my sleep But I'm walking over gravel Forming blisters on my feet You give me all the reasons that make no sense I only choose to be here'Cause she's my friend'Cause she's my friend'Cause she's my friend - oh'Cause she's my friend - oh'Cause she's my friend - oh'Cause she's my friendI think I have the best of me Inside my head No one else competes with me I think I'm great Got spirit tucked away inside I know the ghosts of angel notes to kiss Everything I sing is part of this Got honey brushed across my lips I know, I know, I know, I know If you can call this luck If you can call this luck If you can miss this much Eat my dust you insensitive fuck Eat my dust you insensitive fuck Eat my dust
