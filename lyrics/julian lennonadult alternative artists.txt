Ever since you've been leaving me I've been wanting to cry Now, I know how it feels for you I've been wanting to die But, it's much too late for goodbyes Yes  It's much too late for goodbyes Time has gone since I've been with you And we've been starting to lie Now, it seems you don't care for me And I don't understand why But, it's much too late for goodbyes Yes  It's much too late for goodbyes Ever since you've been far away I've been wanting to fly Now, I know what you meant to me I'm the one who should crySitting on the doorstep of the house I can't afford I can feel you there Thinking of a reason, well, it's really not very hard To love you even though you nearly lost my heart How can I explain the meaning of our love It fits so tight, closer than a glove Sitting on a pebble by the river, playing guitar Wondering if we're really ever gonna get that far Do you know there's something wrong Cause, I've felt it all along I can see your face in the mirrors of my mind Will you still be there We're really not so clever as we seem to think we are We've always got our troubles, so we solve them in the bar As the days go by, we seem to drift apart If I could only find a way to keep hold of your heart Sitting on a pebble by the river, playing guitar Wondering if we're really ever gonna get that far Do you know there's something wrong Cause, I've felt it all alongWe are a rock revolving Around a golden sun We are a billion children Rolled into one So when I hear about The hole in the sky Saltwater wells in my eyes We climb the highest mountain We'll make the desert bloom We're so ingenious We can walk on the moon But when I hear of how The forests have died Saltwater wells in my eyes I have lived for love But now that's not enough For the world I love is dying And time is not a friend As friends we're out of time And it's slowly passing by Right before our eyesI don't wanna know what's going on And I don't wanna know what's right or wrong And I don't wanna know who's bed you're in And I don't wanna know just where you've been Oh baby, you were never really good for me Just maybe, you're a stranger to reality And baby, don't you know you haven't got a clue'cos lately, I don't know what to do I don't wanna know what's going on And I don't wanna know what's right or wrong And I don't wanna know who's bed you're in And I don't wanna know just where you've been Oh baby, you said you're changing for the better now Just maybe, you're not as strong as you thought somehow And baby, you know you're heading down a one way track And baby, I won't bring you back Well, you said you were looking for a better way But you just keep coming back To a place you can never seem to get away That will always hold you back...Oh baby, you said you'd rather be a daddy's girl But lately, you're try'n a fight against the whole wide world Just maybe, you've found a love that you can hold on to And baby, I pray for youYou say you love me, but I think you're wrong We've had times in the past when we weren't so strong Well, I don't know which way to turn And I don't know which way to turn The times have changed, I can read your face There's been so many lies and no tears with your cries Well, I don't know which way to turn And I don't know which way to turn I've been ashamed for so many years I don't know how to cope when you bring out the tears And I don't know which way to turn'Cause I don't know which end to burn I love you more than a man could say We've been through a lot, gone our separate ways Well, I don't know which way to turn And I don't know which way to turn I said I love you, well, I do I don't know whether I'm wrong or whether I'm right Or which way to turn And I don't know which way to turnOoh, ooh  ooh, ooh Let me tell you now Let me tell you Let me tell you Let me tell you right now Let me tell you 'bout the girls I used to know'round the corner on the streets below I've been sittin' here for quite a while They're the kind of girls that make you smile Let me tell you now Let me tell you Let me tell you Let me tell you right now Let me tell you Let me tell you Let me tell you right now I'd like to tell you 'bout some good times I've had The kinda good ones and the kinda bad But if I did you'd know my secrets too Some things are private but I'll give you a clue Let me tell you now Let me tell you Let me tell you Let me tell you right nowI've been taking my time Sipping water from wine Life just feels so divine, I've got you on my mind Please don't wake me, be kind Don't wake me up in the morning Because I'm dreaming of you'Cause dream can't last forever'Cause dream can't all be true'Cause I can feel I'm falling I've been waiting to see What will happen to me I just want to be free, just to dream reality Please,
