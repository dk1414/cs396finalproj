Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth They say in Heaven love comes first We'll make Heaven a place on Earth Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth When the night falls down I wait for you and you come around And the world's alive With the sound of kids on the street outside When you walk into the room You pull me close and we start to move And we're spinning with the stars above And you lift me up in a wave of love Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth They say in Heaven love comes first We'll make Heaven a place on Earth Ooh, Heaven is a place on EarthI'm mad about you You're mad about me, babe Couple of fools run wild, aren't we Pushing the day into the nighttime Somewhere between the two, we start to see Mad about you Lost in your eyes Mad about love You and I Something about you right here beside me Touches the touched part of me like I can't believe Pushing the night into the daytime Watching the sky's first light While the city sleeps Mad about you Lost in your eyes Mad about love You and ITake my hand Tell me what you are feeling Understand, this is just the beginning Although I have to go It makes me feel like crying I don't know when I'll see you again Darling, leave a light on for me I'll be there before you close the door To give you all the love that you need Darling, leave a light on for me'Cause when the world takes me away You are still the air that I breathe I can't explain, I don't know Just how far I have to go But darling, I'll keep the key Just leave a light on for me Yes, I know what I'm asking is crazy You could go, just get tired of waiting But if I lose your love Torn out by my desire That would be the one regret of my lifeSundown all around Walking through the summer's end Waves crash, baby, don't look back I won't walk away again Oh, baby, anywhere you go We are bound together I begin, baby, where you end Some things are forever Circle in the sand, round and round Never ending love is what we've found And you complete the heart of me Our love is all we need Circle in the sand Circle in the sand Cold wind, tide moves in Shivers in the salty air Day breaks, my heart aches I will wait for you right hereWhispering our goodbyes, waiting for the train I was dancing with my baby in the summer rain I can hear him saying: “Nothing will change Come dance with me, baby, in the summer rain”I remember the rain on his skin And his kisses hotter than the Santa Ana winds Whispering our goodbyes, waiting for the train I was dancing with my baby in the summer rain I remember laughing 'til we almost cried There at the station that night I remember looking in his eyes Oh, my love, it's you that I dream of Oh, my love, since that day Somewhere in my heart, I'm always Dancing with you in the summer rain Doesn't matter what I do now Doesn't matter what I say Somewhere in my heart, I'm always Dancing with you in the summer rain, oh, summer I can hear the whistle, military train I was dancing with my baby in the summer rain I can hear him singing: “Oh, love is strange Come dance with me, baby, in the summer rain”I remember the rain pouring down And we poured our hearts out As the train pulled out I can see my baby waving from the train It was the last time that I saw him in the summer rainI remember when I met you All the stars were hanging in mid-air In those moments nothing mattered But the way you caught me in your stare We were walking, we were talking We were laughing about the state of our lives How our fates brought us together As the moon was rising in your eyes On and on the night was falling Deep down inside us On and on a light was shining Right through Ah, la luna, la luna The night that we fell Under the spell of the moon Ah, la luna, la luna The light that will bring me back to you The light of la luna In the hotels, in the cafés All the world was mad with romance In the harbour, moonlit water All the ships were swaying in a dance Then you held me and you kissed me And I knew I had to be with you You didn't ask me, you just took me To the tiny bed in your tiny roomWho'd ya think you're kidding He's the Earth and Heaven to you Try to keep it hidden Honey, we can see right through you Girl, ya can't conceal it We know how you feel and who you're thinking of No chance, no way I won't say it, no, no You swoon, you sigh Why deny it, uh-oh It's too cliché I won't say I'm in love I thought my heart had learned its lesson It feels so good when you start out My head is screaming, “Get a grip, girl Unless you're dying to cry your heart out”You keep on denying Who you are and how you're feeling Baby, we're not buying Hon, we saw you hit the ceiling Face it like a grown up When ya gonna own up that ya got it bad When I'm with you, I shake inside My heart's all tangled up, my tongue is tied It's crazy Can't walk, can't talk Can't eat, can't sleep Oh, I'm in love, oh, I'm in deep'Cause baby With a kiss, you can strip me defenseless With a touch, I completely lose control All that's left of my strength is a memory Whoa, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa I get weak when I look at you Weak when we touch I can't speak when I look in your eyes I get weak when you're next to me Weak from this love I can't speak when I look in your eyes I get weak I get weak Convincing eyes, persuasive lips The helpless heart just can't resist their power You know you've got a hold over me You know you've got me where I want to beHey, hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey, hey We dream the same thing We want the same thing, oh We dream the same thing We want the same thing, oh Here is my case We've got no time to waste'Cause we want the same thing We're fighting a war But we don't know what for'Cause we want the same thing I know we're different now Different as night and day But still I want you I just want you to stay I wanna take this chance I wanna be with you'Cause what you're looking for I am looking for too, oohCan't sleep tonight I feel so shaken Baby, the wind has changed again You come to me Straight out of nowhere Taking me where I've never been Suddenly all of my fences have broken I'm cutting the reins of my life Whoa, runaway horses Take us through the night Runaway horses Ooh, baby, hold on tight Racing through the darkness Trying to find a light You and I on Runaway horses Baby hold on tight Stars guide us now The whole world is sleeping10 million dreams will soon be told Out on this road I'll share your secrets I'm not afraid of where we'll go
