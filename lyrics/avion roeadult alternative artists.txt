Will you bury me Are you there with me Where the twilight ends the violence And you're scared to leave, you're afraid What I feel inside How do I confess Push your habit into me And your fear into the rest Into the rest, until it's all that I have left Into the rest, into the rest Until we had enough Can you imagine, love And how is it ever enough Can you imagine, love And how is it ever enough Can you imagine that Do you feel out of place If I sleep through this moment alone And my heart starts to race Would I fear Is our love the invention of feel-able tension away Can you feel when you lie in redemption, fight for affection And sing to me while I sleep Will you sing to me while I sleep I'm not desperate for you I'm not waiting for your love Get me to want to carry it out It's not you I'm not ready to love I'm not desperate for you I'm not waiting for your love Get me to want to carry it out It's not you I'm not ready to love I'm not ready to feel out of place I could write you a symphony with every heart that you break Can you hear Are we innocent lovers or here to blow others away Can you hear when you lie in redemption, die for attentionWhen you lie Your line of sight I feel is compromised But I, I feel alright I feel alive But I feel denied And I'm holding on to every still frame still in sight And I'll hold on I'll hold on All the world I feel is ours I'll never let you reminisce of me In memory Where all the fear will start to fall If ever you could live in this with me This memory And I'm in a place and time And I'm carving flowers into glass on every side Fall in the light Let your life decide And light a fire in the wind And turn back timeLet the rain fall down Fall into the ocean With every break and sound I've died and died a million times To let it all come down With every single moment Leading you there to hold your ground Can you follow me Can you return to the willow Can you live when the sun burns out Marry me, will you marry me And  away Let the rain fall down Fall into the ocean I never make a sound I've died and died for you Let it all come down A sin is just a moment Leading you there to hold your ground Can you help me feel like I am aliveHere, in the dark, in the cold In the wind rain fire I could die when you lost yourseld Out , out Here, in the night, in your eyes There's a desperation I could die when you lost yourself Sad and alone and in love Hide me Come find me Don't wait for help forever flies by me Here, are you scared, are you lost In a wasted haven I could not but I lost myself Out , out Here, on your skin, in your touch When you scream my name I know I could lie, but I lost myself Sad and alone and in love Holding on the flames get faster Let it burn our love disaster Better on my own We're better off alone Holding on the flames get faster Let it burn our love disaster Better on my own We're better off, we're better offThis cut deeper than I thought How do you hear me in this free fall drown Build back doors when walls come down It's a shy life with nothing to hide from How do I tell you that I let you in Diamond eyes and porcelain skin In the daybreak light I see clear at night I see colors again, I repent when I sin And I stay when I don't want to see a new day When my eyes shut No one can find us Where rain drops fall on sunlit hearts Distant echoes sing bad calls This is blind trust The world is behind us Can oceans flood, is silent sound Do angels smile when the devil frownsAnother day wasted my hands were shaking I'm lost and breathing out And what was I chasing my mind was racing I kept myself in doubt But other than you hell I feel sick we were all torn up and out And every step I take you're not there at all, at all, at all You turned your back and I never looked back And in half the time it was up to the fact that it's all Out of my control It's out of my control You turned your back and I never looked back And in half the time it was up to the fact that it's all Out of my control It's out of my control In another damn place it's another day wasted I can't keep up I've found And in our defense I can not convince you I kept my heart rate down And all of our lies well they caught up, in the end I'll find you out, and Every step I take you're not there is the answer to the loss in you You turned your back and I never looked back And in half the time it was up to the fact that it's all Out of my control It's out of my control You turned your back and I never looked back And in half the time it was up to the fact that it's all Did you ever want to Ever fall in love you Had me from the start did you ever have a clue did you That I loved you Smothered thoughts of just you Chemical and dark blue But you don't have a clue do you All I can see is scenery All in the way you look at me But even if far I'll make it true I'll run til you're out of view I'm so slit my throat in love with you It's less of a mess than I've been through Hardly enough I'm still confused I'll run til you're out of view Did you ever want to Ever fall in love you Had me from the start did you ever have a clue did you That I loved you Smothered thoughts of just you Chemical and dark blue But you don't have a clue do you And you don't have aIf children ran the world There would be no warfare pain Cancer would be cured With money lawyers made The shy would dance with fire And never run away No one would die young There would be no word for hate Lions would run free As proud as they are strong S would teach patience We all would sing along You're letting me go, you know Yeah you're letting me go, you know Yeah you're letting me go, you know Yeah you're letting me go, you know If children ran the world Mothers would stay young Fathers would stay brave The two would stay in love A night would never come Where fear kept us awake There would be no second chance There would be no first mistakeI lost it You can not hear what I said You can not hear The faint attack my world can leave on you, you An offset The smoke will clear it all in A static fear The same reaction I would have On you, you Turn away with all your Faith and they all follow And when you live again Run until you let love in Burn away with all your Faith and they all follow And when you live again Run into oblivion I want it A second chance, I've fallen A new romance I wait to see my world envelope You, you I lost it Your faith became exhausted Your faith became The waste I thought I never had in you, you
