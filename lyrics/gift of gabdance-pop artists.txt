their knees, "Why'd you take him Lord "No homeless people gazing up, thinking vacant thoughts Brand new condominiums sit where there was a vacant lot And still surrounded by this commerce, I feel shaken up Nothing is familiar, feels like money took the place of love When I see the old ladies look afraid like they could run At any moment even though me, I ain't taking nothing It's like this place has lost the essence of the place I'm from Went to the barbershop I used to frequent, place is run Out of business and everyone I knew is straight just gone Feel I should take the bong and hit it to escape the For feeling that you feel when those empowered take your home That feeling is exactly why I had to write this song It was a place I used to call home I tried to chase the energy but now it's all gone And only memories remain I tried to feel the feeling but the city ain't the same They say it's all to improve But tell me where communities are supposed to move When they been living in the trap And those who make it out are hardly ever giving back Tell meOh my god Go to sleep rhymin'And wake up rhymin'Just can't turn it off man I'm just thinking too much Just, I just, I just

hiding they thriving it's marvelous so Obvious y'all be as down to this party in y'all Intimate sentences entering infinite kaka Tangents and ligaments bend and extend in your chakras Didn't and getting and sitting and chilling and filling And spilling it, filling it illigent  This is how it goes Dropping a bomb on a comet; a saga is shaking Father the stopping and polish it all in a breaker Fall on a stopper, and follow the dollar I'll fake ya Although I'm all about Wallace's balling I hate ya Balling your comets are falling all over your acres Swallow your shower of pollen in operative

Verbal-verbal-verbal-verbal-verbal-verbal-verbal-verbal Verbally strike like Lightning Phenomenal Abominable rhymer rally Timin' always automatic Python clouds surrounded to Gather all the planet Night comes down And all about there's a lot of panic Gratification Quick fix Mind manic In the wagon Antagonizing the wind All matter It is the earth who'll stand through The aftermath That'll bring forth many avalanche storms In the canyons Once filled with snow Whether only the tarantulas and insects survive Replacin all humanity We crammin all the damage in the ozone habitat And travellin into a savage end I hope the tabernacle songs Bring upon the awakening of the nap And gonna be a long long summer bakin' up a batch of that wonton soup Plant life cabbage That is guided by the powers Of

It's a journey not of sight but sound Ready or not your bound To also embrace the light And drift on Let your soul be again reborn For these songs buckle up it's the ride of your life Riffin in the octave of the Infinite provocative Come get within a rocket ship Dimensions of a positive Inventions that is monstrous I'm givin' it my all It's just my sentiments Evolving as I give in To the power of just livin'In the now, I put the div-idends I holler from the spirit Within all of us I'm driftin on a cloud up in Your mental feel the shower Follow in, as I devour Y'all with synonyms and vowels Ladies and gentlemen It's our time to dig within a tower Over ignorance, the final hour's Here so come and crowd around And listen up on how I'm stayin driven By the sound I feel it liftin'Higher how my daily livin' is The styles are like my children Seen scoured through the villages And towns, and when the Gift Is in the house I bring the lyrics That come down from up Inherent to the sound From a mysterious, profound Very indigenous way out Chief inner-vision, and I think I've really truly found religion nowAs we proceed...Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back Welcome back to the days and the times of old Welcome back to the classic stories that's been told Welcome back to diamond back whites painted chrome Back when life was a way more simple zone Welcome back to 501 and acid wash jeans If you had tough skins you didn't want to be seen Welcome back to cap session 'til the sun went down Slap box your way before you ever left the town Welcome back to one on one fight with no grounds Being fired fat boy signing session in tower Run D MC, Houdini, my first rap albums Krush Groove, back when Run asked the crowd who's house Breaking one, breakin two beats street, Wild Style Jackson 5 Christmas playing on your radio dial Reminiscing, drifting on a memory in this rap Welcome back, welcome back Welcome back to the crush on a girl next door Fifth period in homeroom passing back notes Welcome back to family barbecues every month Sometimes there would be arguments but it was all love Welcome back to coasters and karate shoes The Great Space Coaster, no Gnews is good Gnews Way before you ever had a sip of your first booze Drunk off life the simple things kept you amused Welcome back to box cuts and jags Jheri curl activate a rock in the plastic bag with a hat on the top When niggas started to sag and gang bang Even if you didn't you had to claim Rocking corduroy hats with a crease on top Stealing fake Gazelles out of the local thrift shop Reminiscing, drifting on a memory in this rap Welcome back, welcome backSomewhere else, on the other side of nowhere, there's another place in space, beyond what you know as time Shine your light now Travel lightyears Find your light now Travel lightyears The epitome of energy enhanced centering Mentally beginning at the end  Remembering entering the gates of the temples of infinity Riveting innate sensibilities, epiphanies levitating thoughts from the earth to begin to see When the trees underneath my feet then begin to shrink  Eye level birds eye view where the buildings be Tendency to find my alignment  It renders me helpless  Submit to the force that is lifting me Instantly, the planet looks small but my senses free fall, should I say rise Seems I'm in too deep, whole life flash by my eyes in like twenty-three seconds Shine your light now Travel lightyears Find your light now Travel lightyears As I pass mars, mass stars, planets all ajar in the solar system See me float farther out of the galaxy  I realize there are more  How far does it go I wonder if there are no endings, beginnings  Yesterday is just tomorrow Seen another sun, another earth, another mars  So far into space, wonder will I see the father Learn the mysteries that were written by the author  If it doesn't end, where's it from, where'd it start though Does it have direction or is all of this is all for nothing just a bunch of molecules who have lost our way To my left thought I saw a flying saucerYo, this is for all of the emcees that taught me um...How to color outta the lines All of the emcees that made me wanna raise the bar And take it to the next level This is for all of y'all I'M MA F UC KI N' K IL L Y OU!I'm abominable I'm a rhymer that's totally all about vocally dominant flows Abolishing fools that be hollerin'Goin' at all of 'em look like you're honestly so horrible Obviously intolerant Send me yo dough on the friendly expresses Just go through my honest opinion but now I'm just listenin' and smilin' and cheesin'Know all my rhymes will go all at emcees And the thousands of pieces will pound them with ease And the standin' around so the thousands is doubts That are out emcee cowards grab on my counts Till they out in they galaxy, out in the clouds cuz the honor of rapping is marvelous, gorgeous Jump down for dying you talk to em bout but they answer I just wanna party and bounce They sing along don't make me think too hard I just came here to relax in my drinking form Don't make my brain work too hard I need T PR Keep it on up please don't rhyme about meteors I'm just an earthling and then I'm like E TR My favorite Martian I feel like I'm speaking to him All of my peeps if you do not mind keeping your Light to yourself because we out here seeking dark--ness I'm like I could just beat you boy You don't want spirit You might just want ouija boards You're the reason hip hops making me sleeping more Until you try to battle then you pee-pee your pants And you fret 'cause
