fire on me They know I'm the truth No need sic'n a liar on me Now what kind of men are we I'm a gangsta comparin' off the sound of Miri Ben-Ari Just listen to the violin strings In the mind of mad man you can hear how triumph ring It's the king of the slum and the violin kingI never meant to hurt you She was just a friend I know I've made mistakes Times before did ignore The pain in your voice There was writing on the wall And it don't take a fool to see You were right for me Meant to be in the beginning Why we had to take this fall Tried my best to show you I loved you Even though I hurt your emotions She was just a friend I knew from before She was just a friend, there was nothing going on Girl, all my life's for you Girl, I never meant to hurt you Didn't really mean to hurt you Tried my best to show I love you And it all turned out so wrong I'll be sitting waiting for you'Cause I know patience is a virtue Gonna do just what I got to Girl, I love youI'm ridin' full speed, leavin' from the ghetto doin'A hundred miles an hour, you can barely see me movin'Gotta shorty waitin' for me that I been pursuin'And I ain't got far to go She a bad chick, somethin' I ain't tryna ruin She's steady callin', so I know she ready to get to it I'm tryna get there but I just can't Seem to catch up to her By the time I got there she was gone And so I walked upstairs and I heard this sound So pretty, so gritty, so funny that no one's around So I locked myself inside and closed the door But there was this funny feeling inside That I couldn't get rid of, then I sing it Miss Melody, who could she be  Describin' me All alone with my ears pressed against the wall Miss Melody, who could she be  Describin' me Alone with my ears pressed against the wall Standin' in front of my window pane The sound got me starin' at the rain The more she play the more I feel the pain Why is she doing this, what's it to gain Seems like she tryna take my soul away Startin' to feel I'm under her control today I can't see her but I hear her from the shades And it seems like she really knows me Every fiddle makes me wanna run away I can't take it no more, gotta get away Got me talkin' about the dark nights In the cage while she starin' at meYeah, yeah, yeah I, J  I wanna write somethin immaculate, cause that's what you are I would say you're bright like the little lights in the night But you're so far beyond the stars M'lady you're bad like the water found on Mars You see when she places the violin under her chin and begins a Melody breezes through the atmosphere like angel's wind Her harmony feels right like when angles bend When she strikes a chord, my Lord She impacts the earth like Mr  Bojangles tappin in Timbs With her no my flow can't be down I scribe of fountains Cause she makes me feel like I can climb mountains Like Frodo and Sam Isn't it obvious this ma'am isn't merely a queen This clearly, this gift is Miri Lord, of the Strings J  Ivy Miri Ben-Ari Play a little love
