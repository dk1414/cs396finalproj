warranty Will a pretty face make it better Oh, Mr  Potato Head, tell me How did you afford her surgery Do you swear you'll stay forever Even if her face don't stay togetherGuess I better wash my mouth out with soap Think I just remembered somethin'I think I left the faucet runnin'Now my words are fillin' up the tub Darling, you're just soaking in it But I know you'll get out the minute You notice all your fingers prunin' up I'm tired of being careful, tiptoe Trying to keep the water warm Let me under your skin Uh-oh, there it goes I said too much, it overflowed Why do I always spill I feel it coming out my throat Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap God, I wish I never spoke Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap I feel it coming out my throat Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap God, I wish I never spoke Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soapYou pull me by my hair so I don't go nowhere Tell me you love me, but you treat me like I'm never there You say the cruelest words, and yes, they break my heart'Cause I'm over here working my ass off Why is it so hard to see  If I cut myself, I would bleed I'm just like you, you're like me Imperfect and human are we Show and tell I'm on display for all you fuckers to see Show, you tell Harsh words if you don't get a pic with me Buy and sell Like I'm a product to society Art don't sell Unless you've fucked every authority You beg and cry for more, and yet I'm on the floor There are strangers takin' pictures of me when I ask "No more"It's really hard for me to say just how I feel I'm scared that I'll get thrown away like a banana peelYou seem to replace your brain with your heart You take things so hard and then you fall apart You try to explain, but before you can start Those cry baby tears come out of the dark Someone's turning the handle to that faucet in your eyes You pour it out where everyone can see Your heart's too big for your body, it's why it won't fit inside You pour it out where everyone can see They call you cry baby, cry baby But you don't fucking care Cry baby, cry baby So you laugh through your tears Cry baby, cry baby'Cause you don't fucking care Tears fall to the ground You'll just let them drown You'll just let them drown Cry baby, cry babyRidin' down, ridin' down My hand on your seat The whole way round I carry band-aids on me now For when your soft hands hit the jagged ground Wheels aren't even touchin' the ground Scared to take them off, but they're so worn down Promise I won't push you straight to the dirt If you promise me you'll take them off first I love everything you do When you call me fuckin' dumb for the stupid shit I do I wanna ride my bike with you Fully undressed, no trainin' wheels left for you I'll pull 'em off for you I love everything you do When you call me fuckin' dumb for the stupid shit I do I wanna ride my bike with you Fully undressed, no trainin' wheels left for you I'll pull 'em all off for you Lettin' go, lettin' go Tellin' you things you already know I explode, I explode Askin' you where you want us to go You've been ridin' two-wheelers all your life It's not like I'm askin' to be your wife I wanna make you mine, but that's hard to say Is this comin' off in a cheesy way
