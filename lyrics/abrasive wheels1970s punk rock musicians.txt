Got my marching orders in the morning post When I read the letter I thought it was a joke You gotta fight fight for what you want You gotta fight fight for what you want You gotta fight fight for what you want But why should we fight when the battle is yours I dont wanna fight in world war three Don't wanna fight the japanese Cos there's no honour in dying for the love of your country And who are you to tell me I gotta fight in a war It won't be the same as thirty nine in nineteen eighty fourPut Maggie Thatcher on the dole Strip her now of her roleOh when the punks go marching in, oh when the punks go marching in I wanna be in that number when the punks go marching in Oh when the skins go marching in, oh when the skins go marching in I wanna be in that number when the skins go marching in Oh when the pigs go marching in, oh when the pigs go marching in I wanna be in that meat van when the pigs go marching in Oh when the wheels go marching in, oh when the wheels go marching in I wanna be in that number when the wheels go marching inThe Russians are coming back The world is black You better get ready For a nuclear attack Atom bombs falling From the sky Does it have to be this way That I die Attack, Attack, the world is black Attack, Attack, a nuclear attack Attack, Attack,nuclear warfare on you The kids have the power in their hands To venture out across the lands Guitars loud and voices proud No-one can crush the wall of sound Rebels armed with song and verse Their destiny to scour the earth Communicating through the airwaves Are you tuned-in to what they say Sonic Omen So you think its's quiet on these dirty streets But listen and you'll hear the beat You'll hear the weapons of the youth A thousand guitars to speak the truth Amps and drums in your front room Is this the answer to the gloom They have the power fast or slow To blow the speakers on your radio Sonic OmenAngry young voices cry, there's a new sun Burning in the sky Saying listen to your heart And not to the people tearing you apart The message is here upon our lips Listen for once, ignore your hip We hold the banner United hand in hand The banner of hope For a truce across the land This generation Holds the banner to the eyes of the nation Like two lovers reaching out In their minds no dark shadows Of dread or doubt We hold the banner United hand in hand The banner of hope For a truce across the landForgotten youth just waste away Sniffing glue to face the day Walking streets signing on Government schemes go on and on It's no use!It's no use!It's no use!Round and round I'm upside down I try to get up, you kick me down Vicious circle there's no hope Around my neck your like a rope Staticians, politicians you feed us crap We're all caught up in a rat trap Rigmarole on the dole Am I alive  I don't knowSitting in a classroom looking into the sky What am I doing here I dont know why Filling my head with history When none of it makes any sense to me Kids dont care about books or rules All they wanna do is burn the schools Kids dont care about books or rules All they wanna do is burn the schools Burn burn burn em down Burn burn burn em down Burn burn burn em down Burn burn What do you learn when youre at school Only to be everybodys fool Teaching us the way to sign A wasted generation oh what a crime Kids dont care about books or rules All they wanna do is burn the schools Kids dont care about books or rules All they wanna do is burn the schools Burn burn burn em down Burn burn burn em down Burn burn burn em down Burn burn And now from the classroom they've taken our hope Eleven years of learning and I can't cope Useless facts and figures in my mind But they never taught me of what id find Kids dont care about books or rules All they wanna do is burn the schools Kids dont care about books or rules All they wanna do is burn the schools Burn burn burn em down Burn burn burn em down Gonna burn burn burn em down Gonna burn burnI've got no money to pay my rent When Friday comes I'm overspent Life just keeps kicking me down When I should be out on the town All the things that I want keep on passing me by I can't get them out of my mind I want it You got it I need it I'm gonna take it mutherf**ker The banks are choker, the shops are packed My pockets are empty and that's a sorry fact Life just keeps kicking me down When I should be out on the town All the things that I want keep on passing me by I can't get them out of my mind That girl's so horny, she's teasing me But what's on offer, it don't come cheap Life just keeps kicking me down When I should be out on the town All the things that I want keep on passing me by I can't get them out of my mindOur world is cut to pieces We are endangered species All this fighting, this warring, this constant friction We fight for so called order We send our sons and daughters All this bloodshed, this hatred, this f**king slaughter But there must be a way We can live without hate We don't have to fight for everything we've got Is this the price you want to pay They feed us propaganda Disguise the real agenda It's all about money, the arms deals, the oil you greed for It's time for all religions To live without division It's our choice, hear out voice, scream until they listen But there must be a way We can live without hate We don't have to fight for everything we've got Is this the price you want to pay Don't let the system tear us apart Open your eyes and you'll find your heart Be part of the cure and not the disease'cause how can you bleed if you ain't got a heart
