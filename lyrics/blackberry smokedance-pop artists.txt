family proud If I didn't think that it would shut the whole place down I'd ride my pony right out of this one horse town Yeah this one horse town I'm an old married man at the age of 23 Got 2 little boys on the baseball team And that might be their only ticket out All they got is a worn out name And a daddy that could've gone all the way But I hung my saddle up and I settled down This little bitty town, it ain't nothing new We all stick around 'cause they all tell us to Swallow your pride just to make your family proud If I didn't think that it would shut the whole place down I'd ride my

from it all Old ghost whistle in the wind in the dead of night, night I'm walkin' through the valley of the shadow headin' for the light, light I wore out my welcome like I always do Got to find myself a life that's shiny new They say that the truth is gonna set us free I ain't waitin' 'round to see Miles and miles wide open for me Got it all laid out so beautifully Don't you worry 'bout a thing, baby, we can run away from it all Squeezin' every drop outta what's left of my time Jumpin' on tormorrow before it goes by No matter what they say, baby, we can run away from it allTwo six
