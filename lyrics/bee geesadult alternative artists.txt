I know your eyes in the mornin' sun I feel you touch me in the pourin' rain And the moment that you wander far from me I wanna feel you in my arms again And you come to me on a summer breeze Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave And it's me you need to show How deep is your love How deep is your love  How deep is your love I really mean to learn'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools Breakin' us down When they all should let us be We belong to you and me I believe in you You know the door to my very soul You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour You're my saviour when I fallWell, you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk The music loud and the women warm I've been kicked around since I was born And now it's alright, it's okay And you may look the other way But we can try to understand The New York Times' effect on man Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive Ah, ah, ah, ah Stayin' alive, stayin' alive Ah, ah, ah, ah Stayin' alive Oh, when you walk Well now, I get low and I get high And if I can't get either, I really try Got the wings of Heaven on my shoes I'm a dancin' man and I just can't loseMy baby moves at midnight Goes right on 'til the dawn My woman, take me higher My woman, keep me warm What you doin' on your back  Hey What you doin' on your back  Hey You should be dancing, yeah Dancing, yeah She's juicy and she's trouble She gets it to me good My woman, give me power Go right down to my blood What you doin' on your back  Hey What you doin' on your back  Hey You should be dancing, yeah Dancing, yeah What you doin' on your back What you doin' on your back  Hey You should be dancing, yeah Dancing, yeahOh, girl, I've known you very well I've seen you growing every day I never really looked before But now you take my breath away Suddenly you're in my life Part of everything I do You got me working day and night Just trying to keep a hold on you Here in your arms, I found my paradise My only chance for happiness And if I lose you now, I think I would die Oh, say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine We can take forever, just a minute at a time More than a woman More than a woman to me More than a woman More than a woman to me Oh, now there are stories old and true Of people so in love like you and me And I can see myself Let history repeat itself Reflecting how I feel for you Thinking 'bout those people then I know that in a thousand years I'd fall in love with you againThere's a light A certain kind of light That never shone on me I want my life to be lived with you Lived with you There's a way everybody say To do each and every little thing But what does it bring If I ain't got you, ain't got you  Hey babe You don't know what it's like, baby You don't know what it's like To love somebody To love somebody The way I love you In my brain I see your face again I know my frame of mind You ain't got to be so blind And I'm blind, so so sorrily blind I'm a man, can't you see What I am I live and I breathe for you But what good does it do If I ain't got you, ain't got  Hey babeI started a joke Which started the whole world crying But I didn't see That the joke was on me, oh no I started to cry Which started the whole world laughing Oh, if I'd only seen That the joke was on me I looked at the skies Running my hands over my eyes And I fell out of bed Hurting my head from things that I'd said'Til I finally died Which started the whole world living Oh, if I'd only seen That the joke was on me I looked at the skies Running my hands over my eyes And I fell out of bed Hurting my head from things that I'd saidListen to the ground There is movement all around There is something goin' down And I can feel it On the waves of the air There is dancin' out there If it's somethin' we can share We can steal it And that sweet city woman, she moves through the light Controlling my mind and my soul When you reach out for me, yeah, and the feelin' is right Gimme that night fever, night fever We know how to do it Gimme that night fever, night fever We know how to show it Here I am Prayin' for this moment to last Livin' on the music so fine Borne on the wind, makin' it mineNobody gets too much heaven no more It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line Nobody gets too much love anymore It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb Ooh, you and me, girl got a lot of love in store And it flows through you And it flows through me And I love you so much more Then my life, I can see beyond forever Everything we are will never die Love is such a beautiful thing Oh, you make my world a summer day Are you just a dream to fade away Nobody gets too much heaven no more It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line Nobody gets too much love anymore It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb You and me, girl, got a highway to the sky We can turn away From the night and day And the tears you had to cryHere I lie in a lost and lonely part of town Held in time in a world of tears, I slowly drown Going home, I just can't make it all alone I really should be holding you, holding you Loving you, loving you Tragedy When the feeling's gone, and you can't go on, It's tragedy When the morning cries and you don't know why, it's hard to bear With no one to love you, you're going nowhere Tragedy When you lose control, and you got no soul, it's tragedy When the morning cries and you don't know why, it's hard to bear With no one beside you, you're going nowhere Night and day, there's a burning down inside of me, aaah Burning love with a yearning that won't let me be Down I go, and I just can't take it all alone I really should be holding you, holding you Loving you, loving youSmile an everlasting smile A smile can bring you near to me Don't ever let me find you gone Cause that would bring a tear to me This world has lost its glory Let's start a brand new story Now my love, right now There'll be no other time And I can show you how, my love Talk in everlasting words And dedicate them all to me And I will give you all my life I'm here if you should call to me You think that I don't even mean A single word I say It's only words, and words are all I have To take your heart away
