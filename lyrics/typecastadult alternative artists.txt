She said it's over And I don't stand a chance She said it honestly I wished that she lied Her words said it all Minus me Minus the actions And the understanding She will never do I never take advantage And I don't have the guts She dropped me out And shes leaving me It's the last time did I pushed too hard I didn't mean to make me cry But thats okay who's wrong And understanding You'll never understand What you think And what I feel Doesn't make any sense It's the last time did I pushed too hard I didn't mean to make me cry But thats okay who's wrong And understanding You'll never understand What you think And what I feel Doesn't make any senseStandard pick-up lines that seems to wreck your bones Can this be a sequel of my dying hope Chasing down a never ending make-believe But you're a perfect match of consistency Will you come back in a heartbeat Don't be confused of what a great thing we could be We'll take a walk on the same street Can you tell me how Boston is like without me You're image is stamp beneath the insides of my heart Now you're gone I don't know where to start The evidence is showing like a stable apprehension But you're the only one who's apt for this affectionSo what's the point in all of this When you will never change The days have passed, The weather's changed Should I be sorry  Could I be sorry I did it all, all for you Hoping you would see Your eyes are dull, your hands are clenched Are we ready  Are we ready But you, you think about yourself Only but yourself But what about..Un-lonely nights Romantic moments The love, the love What about them Throw it all away You know me well, You know it's wrong Then what is it you feel You hide behind those perfect smiles It won't fool me, cause you already didOne last drink One more before I go It's a little late and I'm going home alone I can still remember Those words you said to me Things would be much better if you're with me I was so naive to think That I could change your ways What I'd do for a pretty face Now I'm a little wiser Now I'm less naive I won't let myself be used by you'Cause I was so convinced And I was so consumed Lesson learned Please don't apologize It's too late to take it back I knew that this is how you'd react Your beautiful eyes don't work no more Not your lips, not your tongue, not your mouth I can still remember Those words you said to me Should have listened to my friends I was so naive to think That I could change your ways What I'd do for a pretty faceIt's not as easy as it sounds Like I'll be breaking down again One thing that keeps me sane Is the promise that we keep But you're so calm Yet so brave I'll watch you sleep and wish That this moment will never change Go on, I will be waiting here Be strong, nothing for you to fear Hang on, this isn't over Go on, I will be waiting here Plant my eyes onto the ground And I will never make a sound'Cause this is something I believe That you'll be coming home to me Distance, again our mortal enemy We've been winning all these years So please don't give up on Don't give up on me Go on, I will be waiting here Be strong, nothing for you to fear Hang on, this isn't over Go on, I will be waitingShe
