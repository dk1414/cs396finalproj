I knew there couldn't be another way I'll hold you tight I'll hold you tight when the night is cold Love and devotion Love and devotion may be news to you Sincere emotion Sincere emotion has to last all through But when the night is cold Protect my heart and soul Keeping our mystery aliveA time to live A place to go Around the world My army of lovers Be-be, aye, be-be, aye Around the world,
