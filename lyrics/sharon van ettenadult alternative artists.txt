Pace man for you Hold my horses patient Hey, man, tricks can wait To heal my emotions Every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble Every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble People say I'm a one hit wonder But what happens when I have two I washed your dishes But I shit in your bathroom Even when the sun comes up, I'm in trouble Even when the sun comes up, I'm in trouble We broke your glasses But covered our asses Take time silently Feel real room high fiveWill the marker stain the skin Stole the dress I saw you in Now nothing comes to mind Saw a life as override One more session overdrive The ceiling is the roof Change address and draw a line Show my friends a silver lie Call my family just to know they're there Sleeping in late like I used to Crossing my fingers like I used to Waiting inside like I used to Avoiding big crowds like I used to Crawl the field and let you in Brand my hеart I found you in To say nothing's more apart Will my lover be thеre, stay Follow them to less the pain The ceiling must be wrongI wish I knew what to do with you But the truth is I ain't got a clue Do you Do you I wish I had an idea of what I need But we, oh we, can't know and that's okay That's okay I wish you'd understand I wish that I could know The truth is I have no idea I wish we could just run around And only worry about right now I hate to admit it but I don't know shit And neither do you, do you, do you, do you And that is good Enough for me, for you, for now As long as we can talk about itChained To the wall of our room Yeah, you chained me like a dog in our room I thought that's how it was I thought that we were fine Then the day was night You were high, you were high when I was doomed And dying for...With no life, with no light Tied to my bed I was younger then I had nothing to spend but time on you But it made me love, it made me love, it made me love more It made me love, it made me love, it made me love more Do what you said The words she said left out Over into the sky where I'll soon fly And she took the time to believe in, to believe in what she said She made me love, she made me love, she made me love more She made me love, she made me love, she made me love moreIt's understood You'll be a man by the time I see you We've been through better days And you've tasted all my pain Break my legs so I won't walk to you Cut my tongue so I can't talk to you Burn my skin so I can't feel you Stab my eyes so I can't see You like it when I let you walk over me You tell me that you like it Your love is killing me Try to tell you this when I'm sober How I feel about loving you Try to remember all the turn of events Being led by our own fantasies, fantasies Break my legs so I won't walk to you Cut my tongue so I can't talk to you Burn my skin so I can't feel you Stab my eyes so I can't see You like it when I let you walk over me You tell me that you like it When our minds become diseasedIt was a close call Sitting in the back of the room With a boy you could own But they didn't know Close in on my black eye I feel safe at times Certain emblems Tell me it's time Serpents in my mind Looking for your crimes Everything changes I don't want mine to this time You enjoy sucking on dreams So I will fall asleep with someone other than you I had a thought you would take me seriously And listen on Serpents in my mind I am searching for your crimes Everything changes In timeHit the ground The yard, I found something I could taste your mouth Shut the door Now in the sun tanning You were so just Looking across the sky Can't remember I can't recall, no I can't remember anything at all We skipped the sunrise Looking across the grass Said he wanted And not that I'm every It's the same, I could mean you were right Everyone else Hasn't a chance, don't Fail me now Open arms, rest Let's run under Cursing myself at night Slow it was 7 I wish it was 7 all nightI know what you wanna say I think that you're all the same Constantly being led astray You

used to be seventeen, I used to be seventeen Now you're a hotshot hanging on my block Sun coming up, who's my shadow La-la-la-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la-la-la-la
