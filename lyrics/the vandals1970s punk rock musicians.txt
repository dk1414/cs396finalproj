conform to society But the back says I have personality Even if it's really, really, even if it's really, really bad I've got an ape drape, yes, I do They're givin' them to anyone and that means you

punk just like any other boy And he never had no trouble 'til he started up his Oi band Safe in the garage or singin' in the tub'Til Haji went too far and he plugged in at the pub'Twas a cold Christmas eve when Trevor and the skins Popped in for a pint and to nick a bag of crisps Trevor liked the music but not the unity He unwound Haji's turban and he knocked him to his knees If God came down on Christmas Day I know exactly what he'd say He'd say "Oi!" to the punks and "Oi!" to the skins But "Oi!" to the world and everybody wins Haji was a bloody mess, he ran out through the crowd He said "we'll meet again, we are bloody yet unbowed"Trevor called his bluff and told him where to meet Christmas Day on the roof down at 20 Oxford Street If God came down on Christmas Day I know exactly what he'd say He'd say "Oi!" to the punks and "Oi!" to the skins But "Oi!" to the world and everybody winsHere in America, respect your fellow man Some foreign cultures don't understand We got this little rule and it's called elbow room Pertaining to the spatial occupancy you consume If I'm in front in line, then you should stay behind Until I get my icy soda It's such a simple thing, it's called first come, first serve Wooden clogs that smash my feet, I really don't deserve In every region, it seems there's a legion Of impatient, close-talking slime that cut in line Barge me with your walking, spray me with your talking I am the ambassador of Kick-your-assador What's your affinity for my vicinity There's plenty room here in your country It's just good etiquette to use deodorant Maybe smelling bad's the way you choose to representI once had a girlfriend But then one day she dumped me And everywhere I'd go People would ask me where she was I don't want to talk about her Someone always asks about her So I tell them all my girlfriend's dead I say it's leukemia Or sometimes bulimia Or a great big truck ran her over And chopped off her head I don't want to talk about her Someone always asks about her So I tell them all she's dead I guess there's a part of me That likes the sympathy Or the looks on their faces when I tell them How she passed awayI want to be a Cowboy
