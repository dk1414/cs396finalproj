Baby  Why are you doing this to me Sweetheart  Are those your eyes staring straight back at me Angel  I see you smile everywhere!Darling  Stop!Night falls and I'm running in circles I'm being chased by my imagination Tell me I'm forgiven say you'll always be mine Say that everything is over, tell me I'm fine No one deserves to live like this!Tell me I'm forgiven say you'll always be mine Say that everything is over, tell me I'm fine No one deserves to live like this!I touch your lips and stare in your eyes You smile and it makes me fly You are the reason my heart beats Tonight it's just you and me Night as dark as my thoughts sets the scene for my return Lightning nips at my heels as I race home Wearily i stagger towards the song of her pale voice Demons jeer my attempt to be freeSweat drips in my eyes Screams of lust we cry Tonight you are everything You're everything...You're everything to me no more As I wake from this perfect dream I'll escape from Eden's walls Can I not stay and live this lie For I must think only of myself And to think that you would not be scared Or surprised if I'd severed all these ties This is the end...I'll lose myself in anguish for tonight Help me get over you I feel so numb to see this bitter end End of beautiful illusions Broken pieces will not mend One last kiss to save our past nowA touch of poison seals my fate The sun Himself Honors me Once king of roses, now lord of gold Blessed with the gift of gilded touch The Gods themselves envy my hand Fate wields its knife to cut the thread I curse the day my dream became my descent Suddenly I long for you, my only love In my perfection, I have no want A folly as fatal as sin Yet eyes still glint with greed untold Has now become the end of me I curse the day my dream became my descent Suddenly I long for you, my only love Have I not.. No one ever said that life was fair And I'm not saying that it should be So knowing that you are what you want to be and I'm not comes as no surprise But don't expect me to be happy for you And don't smile at me and tell me things will work out for me too I don't want your pity I hate your pity Taste your vanity and its sweet bitterness As you hide behind your veil of My stolen hopes and lost dreams You took them all As you build your dreams On my shattered hopes I'll look back on A day once loved And fantasize for Tragedy Swallow your pity Beg me to make this easier And listen to my hopeless criesLook at the sky as the night descends The rain is crashing down, Ive hit another dead end Just before I let hope slip away A shadow is revealed, the devil shows his face Im scared to death and have myself to blame, Im to blame How did we end up fighting anyway You know, I used to search the sky and dream of where you were I need you by my side, we can end this together I know I promised you the world and still I let you down I need you by my side and together well end this now Look in my eyes  am I shaking now I am all you fear, have I made myself clear Shut your mouth and finish what youve started Boy, you haven't got the slightest idea Just who I am and what I do for you Dont you see that I am trying to save you Shut your mouth and finish what youve started Im scared to death and have myself to blame, no one else How did we end up fighting anyway You know, I used to search the sky and dream of where you were I need you by my side, we can end this together I know I promised you the world and still I let you down I need you by my side and together well end this nowIf only you could see If only you could see You're the only girl I've ever dreamed of If only you could see If only you could see Should I apologize to such pathetic eyes Just the sight of you has made me sick tonight It was your poison kiss that turned me into this Then again there is a chance you could be mine tonight Darling, will you please take a walk with me We can count the stars that disappear I wish you could see You're the only girl I've ever dreamed of Are you satisfied What fate has led me here  Oh, please forgive me dear I don't know if I could survive on my own I could have married you instead I buried you Now we'll see if I can fall asleep alone Is it her, could it be Should my eyes believe what they see If you are who I think you are I might lose my mind Just a kiss from her lips And I would simply float away The way her hips swing back and forth I've got butterflies Dead girls don't just appear out of thin air But I am victim to her sinister stare Please don't hate me for what I've done Run away with me, I'll be everything that you need Such a pretty girl screams to me Take my hand, take my breath away What if my heart breaks the spell Take my breath away Just a scent of her skin Unlocks forbidden memories Your smiles that break the fragile hand I've got butterflies Dead girls don't just appear out thin air But I am victim to her sinister stareI’m having trouble breathing And if I don’t think fast I’m likely to find myself here for good Panic sets in as I start to question Why I see you standing there behind the glass...Who said that we never would touch the speed of light So far behind me, understanding Stars become rivers flowing backwards, oh yeah!When did my heartbeat start to echo Why are my thoughts now;Fading, drifting, yeah, twisting, yeah, tearing, yeah, bleeding  Yeah!Excuse me, are you a maniac  I am and I’m okay with that Yea-ah-ah One last night, one final kiss Desire begging me not to go Goodbye my everything I’m terrified, I pull you near Making sure that you are real Open my eyes, it was all a dream Goodbye my everythingHave you ever actually seen yourself without a mirror To slip through the cracks of the universe My love so true, is my gift to you Trapped in a world that was dreamt by a madman Hallelujah  Hallelujah!Little did he know his dreams would come true I’m on to you  I’m on to you!Think, if only he could see the gorgeous rage Then maybe he would never have bled ink on page An artist, he was so consumed by a world he saw in his mind A world sadistic with lies and panicking cries Our world is so callous and cold, empty and lost I’ll bleed for you, to change it all, I’ll die for you to save us all This could be our only chance This could be our only hope Lost in your passion, endless attraction, forever yours You make me feel like I’m invincible Love sings such a sweet ending Ballad of lust, anticipate the irresistibleI've made up my mind and I will be leaving Leaving this cruel, dark world for the soulless to share But first...Women will shriek and watch their husbands bleed Children will cry and watch their mothers die Because tonight...Tonight we all go to hell!Why I have to let go of what happened to my love I am taking out on everyone else all the problems I've brought on myself When I made your heart melt My belle, we soon will meet again There's nothing left for me to lose except confusion I'm finished trying to tell myself this will go away There's no one left to talk me down My feet are slipping...One day I hope my name doesn't bring back memories Of the day that I left her Goodbye, so long My heart belongs to the one I am chasing after For better, or even for worse, remember me forever..
