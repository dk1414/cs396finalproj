We were good, we were gold Kinda dream that can't be sold We were right 'til we weren't Built a home and watched it burn Mm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie Started to cry, but then remembered I I can buy myself flowers Write my name in the sand Talk to myself for hours Say things you don't understand I can take myself dancing And I can hold my own hand Yeah, I can love me better than you can Can love me better, I can love me better, baby Can love me better, I can love me better, baby Paint my nails cherry-red Match the roses that you left No remorse, no regret I forgive every word you saidI never came to the beach or stood by the ocean I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand But you brought me here, and I'm happy that you did'Cause now I'm as free, as birds catchin' the wind I always thought I would sink, so I never swam I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand But here I am, next to you The sky's more blue in Malibu Next to you in Malibu Next to you We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'I'd spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin'You would explain the current, as I just smile Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change And it'll be us, just for a while, do they even exist That's when I make a wish, to swim away with the fish'Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me I'd be here writing this songWe clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain We jumped, never asking why We kissed, I fell under your spell A love no one could deny Don't you ever say I just walked away I will always want you I can't live a lie, running for my life I will always want you I came in like a wrecking ball I never hit so hard in love All I wanted was to break your walls All you ever did was wreck me Yeah, you, you wreck me I put you high up in the sky And now, you're not coming down It slowly turned, you let me burn And now, we're ashes on the ground Don't you ever say I just walked away I will always want you I can't live a lie, running for my life I will always want youIt's our

sky is the road I'm takin'Head high up in the clouds I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no I don't need to be loved by you Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no I don't need to be loved by you See my lips on her mouth, everybody's talkin' now, baby Ooh, you know it's true That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no I don't need to be loved by you La, la, la-la, laI hopped off the plane at L AX With a dream and my cardigan Welcome to the land of fame excess Am I gonna fit in Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign This is all so crazy Everybody seems so famous My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick Too much pressure and I'm nervous That's when the taxi man turned on the radio And a J AY-Z song was on And a J AY-Z song was on And a J AY-Z song was on So I put my hands up They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah"Movin' my hips like, "Yeah"Got my hands up, they're playing my song I know I'm gonna be okay Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A  Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A  Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh Once upon a time, it was paradise Once upon a time, I was paralyzed Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights But it's time to let it go Once upon a time, it was made for us Woke up one day, it had turned to dust Baby, we were found, but now we're lost So it's time to let it go I want my house in the hills Don't want the whiskey and pills I don't give up easily But I don't think I'm down So won't you slide away Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights So won't you slide away Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away So won't you slide away Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights So won't you slide away Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide awayOh-oh, hey, oh-oh Baby, baby, yeah, are you listening Wondering where you've been all my life I just started living Ooh-oh, baby, are you listening Oh-oh When you say you love me Know I love you more And when you say you need me Know I need you more Boy, I adore you I adore you Baby, can you hear me When I'm crying out for you I'm scared, oh, so scared But when you're near me I feel like I'm standing with an army Of men armed with weapons, hey, oh-ohMmm, mmm, mmm Flowers in hand, waiting for me Every word in poetry Won't call me by name, only "baby"The more that you give, the less that I need Everyone says I look happy When it feels right I know that you're wrong for me Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave I brought you down to your knees'Cause they say that misery loves company It's not your fault I ruin everything And it's not your fault I can't be what you need Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me I'm everything they said I would be La, la, la I'm everything they said I would be I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye Before you let go, just one more time Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine A little more hurt won't kill you Tonight, mother says you don't look happy Close your eyes
