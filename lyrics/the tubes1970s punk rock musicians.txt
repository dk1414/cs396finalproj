Step right up And don't be shy Because you will not believe your eyes She's right here Behind the glass You're gonna like her'Cause she's got class You can look inside another world You get to talk to a pretty girl She's everything you dream about But, don't fall in love!She's a beauty She's one in a million girls She's a beauty Why would I lie Why would I lie You can say Anything you like But you can't touch the merchandise She'll give you Every penny's worth But, it will cost you A dollar firstOoh, baby Move closer to me I've had all that I can stand Take hold of me with your hands Oh, baby You give me the chills Whisper low in my ear Let me know how it feels Just to know you are near Your body gives me a thrill As it leans against mine I love how it feels With your jeans against mine B:  The smell of burning leather B: As we hold each other tight B: As our rivets rub together B: Flashing sparks into the night Re: At this moment of surrender, darling Re: If you really care Re: Don't touch me there Re: Don't touch me there Re: Don't touch me there Re: Don't touch me there Teenage, had a race for the nighttime Spent my cash on every high I could find Wasted time in every school in L.A Gettin' loose, I didn't care what the kids say We're white punks on dope Mom and Dad moved to Hollywood Hang myself when I get enough rope Can't clean up, though I know I should White punks on dope, white punks on dope White punks on dope, white punks on dope Other dudes are living in the ghetto But born in Pacific Heights Don't seem much betto We're white punks on dope Mom and Dad live in Hollywood Hang myself when I get enough rope I can't clean up, though I know I should White punks on dope, white punks on dope White punks on dope, white punks on dope I go crazy cause my folks are so fuckin' rich Have to score when I get that rich white punk itch Sounds real classy, living in a chateau So lonely, all the other kids will never knowAs I mentioned near the close of the last record, this record you are now playing is another example of the completion backward principle  If you can possibly manage the time, please play both sides at one meeting I met her on a strip It was another lost weekend The band was too slick And the people were twisted So I asked her for a date She reluctantly agreed Then we went to my place And she never did leave She won’t even miss me when she’s gone And that’s okay with me I’ll cry later on It’s been six months She hasn’t shut up once I’ve tried to explain She’s driving me insane She won’t even miss me when she’s gone And that’s okay with me I’ll cry later on Talk to ya later—don’t want to hear it again tonight Talk to ya later—just save it for another guy Talk to ya later—don’t want to hear it again tonight I’ll just see you aroundWhat do you want from life To kidnap an heiress Or threaten her with a knife What do you want from life To get cable T VAnd watch it every night There you sit, a Lump in your chair Where do you sleep And what do you wear When you're sleeping What do you want from life An Indian guru To show you the inner light What do you want from life A meaningless love affair With a girl that you met tonight How can you tell when you're doin' alright Does your bank account swell While you're dreaming at night How do you know when you're really in love Do violins play when you're touching the one That you're loving Real, almost real I could feel the life Flow into my veins Done, now it's done I have fallen for the final time I can't get up again Love's supposed to make you glad Tell me, why I feel so bad I won't see you anymore And if that's what love is for Then I don't understand Free, now you're free You don't need me And you don't want what I give Please, help me please'Cause if life is made for hearts in love Then how am I to live Alright!Yeah!I wish I was the man With the mechanical heart I'd conquer all my enemies alone I'd tear the guys apart Then scatter the pieces I wish I was the man In the soundproof booth I wish I had a chance to stump the band Or maybe tell truth And maybe I could win a color television Television Television Television TV is king, you're my everything I wish I had the girl With the bouncy hair We'd ride off in a brand new car Or fly a plane somewhere Like probably JamaicaSkating down in Shinjuku When I smelled love in the air Strolling by the pagoda The fragrance floats from somewhere Will my Suki find me in time Or will her sushi spawn The odor drives me outta my mind The scent goes straight to my prawn Su-su-sushi Mushi-mushi Cherry blossom and rice Su-su-sushi she’s so nice Breathlessly, I order away This one thinks it's still swimmin'Tail and fin, she dives right in Who could ever want more Su-su-sushi Mushi-mushi Cherry blossom  and rice Su-su-sushi she’s so niceWell, the very first time that I saw you there You know I couldn't believe my eyes I thought I was the winner of The Price is Right And they let me keep every prize I've never been famous as a ladies man I'm not known as a crazy guy In fact, I've never made the papers over nothin' at all I think it's time somebody gave me a try Baby, be mine tonight And this old world will turn out alright Just to find you took a whole lifetime I could lose you in a minute's time Be mine tonight Be mine tonight I don't know if you've ever been in love before But I think this is my very first time I wish someone could tell me what my next move is I'm afraid I'm falling way behind I know you've been around about as much as I have When the lights go out, we'll see You can further your education all your life Honey, just don't make a fool out of meCome fly with me What are you waiting for Come fly with me Don't waste a minute more I'll give you my prime time I'm saving my prime time
