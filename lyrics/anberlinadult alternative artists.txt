Feels like you’re miles from here In other towns with lesser names Where the unholy ghost doesn’t tell Mary or William exactly what they want to hear You remember the house on Ridge Road Told you and the Devil to both just leave me alone If this is salvation, I can show you the trembling You’ll just have to trust me  I’m scared I am the patron saint of lost causes Are we all to you just mere lost causes Aren’t we all to you just lost Tommy, you left behind Something that will mean everything right before you die What if you gained the whole world You’ve already lost four little souls from your life Widows and orphans aren’t hard to find They’re home missing daddy who’s saving the abandoned tonight Wish your drinking would hurry and kill you Sympathy’s better than having to tell you the truth That you are the patron saint of lost causes All you are to them is now a lost cause All you are to them is now, causesWhen your only friends are hotel rooms Hands are distant lullabies If I could turn around I would tonight These roads never seemed so long Since your paper heart stopped beating Leaving me suddenly alone Will daybreak ever come Who's gonna call on Sunday morning Who's gonna drive you home I just want one more chance To put my arms in fragile hands I thought you said forever A sleepless night becomes bitter oblivion These thoughts run through my head Complaints of violins become my only friends August evenings Bring solemn warnings to remember To kiss the ones you love goodnight You never know what temporal days may bring Laugh, love, live free, and sing When life is in discord Praise ye the LordYour motive, unstable You're like an unwinding cable car Listening for voices, but it's the choices that make us who we are Go your own way, even seasons have changed Just burn those new leaves over So self-absorbed, you've seemed to ignore The prayers that have already come about This is the correlation of salvation and love Don't drop your arms, I'll guard your heart With quiet words I'll lead you in Lalalala, la la la, la lala, la Lalalala, la la la, la lala, la Backing away from the problem of pain You never had a home You've been misguided, you're hiding in shadows for so very long Don't you believe that you've been deceived That you're no better than The hair in your eyes, it never disguised What you're really thinking ofOne last glance from a taxi cab Images scar my mind Four weeks've felt like years Since your full attention was all mine The night was young and so were we Talked about life, God, death, and your family Didn't want any promises Just my undivided honesty And you said"Oh, oh, things are gonna change now for the better ""Oh, oh, things are gonna change  Oh, they're gonna change"I am the patron saint of lost causes A fraction of who I once believed Only a matter of time Opinions I will try and rewrite If life had background music Playing your song I've got to be honest - I tried to escape you But the orchestra plays onSo let me get this straight Say now you loved me all along What made you hesitate To tell me with words what you really feel I can see it in your eyes You mean all of what you say I remember so long ago See, I felt the same way Now we both have separate lives and lovers Insignificantly enough we both have significant others Only time will tell Time will turn and tell We are who we were when Could've been lovers but at least you're still my day late friend We are who We are who we were when Who knew what we know now Could've been more but at least you're still my day late friend We are who We are who we were whenThere's a hatchet, got a knife When I awoke there was nothing real in this life But dreams are so intoxicating When you're doing this alone Gun, rope, brick on the way But words have no meaning When it's you that says, "I really do care"No baby I, I really do care Innocence gone Never take friendship personal If you can't hold yourself together Why should I hold you now In a sense gone Never take friendship personal If you can't hold yourself together Why should I hold you now Once a skeptic, now the critic And you think that you finally Found a place of your own Amongst the cold and timid souls Where only failure knows your name Look around for the closest to blame But look no further than the Hands beneath your arms And now you're six feet down Buried with, with your passing fame, fame, fame, fameThere's someone inside me That softly kills everyone around They don't know they're dead to me cause Intent never makes a sound All along they've found I've strangled Lovers who've learned from slower hands In these eleven minutes I could teach you what I am You're sick Sick as all the Secrets that you deny Sins like skeletons are So very hard to hide You're sick Sick as all the Secrets that you deny Sins like skeletons are So very hard to hide There's an art in seclusion Production in repression If a stranger turns up missing This song is my confession Tell the tales of the trail of dead Lovers learned from slower hands Losing self in myself And my demons make demandsDo you remember when we were just kids And cardboard boxes took us miles from what we would miss Schoolyard conversations taken to heart And laughter took the place of everything we knew We were not I wanna break every clock The hands of time could never move again We could stay in this moment For the rest of our lives Is it over now, hey  Is it over now I wanna be your last first kiss That you'll ever have I wanna be your last first kiss Amazing how life turns out The way that it does We end up hurting the worst The only ones we really love I wanna break every clock The hands of time could never move again We could stay in this moment For the rest of our lives Is it over now, hey  Is it over now "I'm here for you" she said"And we can stay for a while My boyfriend's gone We can just pretend"Lips that need no introduction Now who's the greater sin Your drab eyes seem to invite Where do we begin Was this over before Before it ever began Your kiss, your calls, your crutch Like the devil's got your hand This was over before Before it ever began Your lips, your lies, your lust Like the devil's in your hands Everyone in this town Is seeing somebody else Everybody's tired of someone Our eyes wander for help Prayers that need no answer now Cause I'm tired of who I am You were my greatest mistake I fell in love with your sin Your littlest sinYou make my teeth clench and my hands shake Do you ever see what you do to me Wearing me out, just wearing me out But I'm wearing you down You're impossible to love or leave So impossible to win or please I'm wearing you out, just wearing you out But I'm wearing you down Take what you want from me It means nothing now Take everything from me It means nothing now Not so easy to forgive; harder to forget Take what you want I make your lips wet and your bones quake Try to think through what I can do to you It's wearing me thin Can I begin to wear you out
