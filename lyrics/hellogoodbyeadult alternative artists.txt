I like where we are When we drive, in your car I like where we are, here'Cause our lips can touch And our cheeks can brush Our lips can touch, here Well, you are the one, the one that lies close to me Whispers "Hello, I've missed you quite terribly"I fell in love, in love with you suddenly Now there's no place else I could be but here in your arms I like where you sleep When you sleep, next to me I like where you sleep, here Our lips can touch And our cheeks can brush'Cause our lips can touch, hereI woke up tired and feeling old And I wondered why my bed was cold And I thought could you have gone And if so, where and how long And why would I let you go Why would I ever let you go Oh, but sometimes my mind Could tell my heart that yes is no Like sometime I might wake up old and all alone Oh no, what if I never knew your name Oh my god, the thought's insane What if your love is not the same As it seems inside my brain What if you're not really in my sheets Oh, just the thought gives me the creeps I woke up young in lovers love And I felt my luck when I felt your touch And my skin, it wondered how Yeah, my skin, it wondered how Could you be touching me right now When in my sleep, you can't be found Oh, it is love From the first time I set my eyes up on yours Thinking oh, is it love Oh dear It's been hardly a moment And you are already missed There is still a bit of your skin That I've yet to have kissed Oh say please do not go But you know you know that I must Oh say I love you so But you know you know you can trust We'll be holding hands once again All our broken plans I will mend I will hold you tight so you know It is love from the first Time I pressed my hand into yours Thinking Oh is it love Oh dear, its been hardly three days And I'm longing to feel your embrace There are several days Until I can see your sweet face Oh say wouldn't you like to be older and married with me Oh say wouldn't it be nice to know right now that we'll be Someday holding hands in the end All our broken plans will have been I will kiss you soft so you know It is love from the first Time I pressed my lips against yours Thinking Oh is it love When we first met Your hair was long and brown You hadn't yet cut it all off And now it's long once again, oh Oh, it's long once again As I kept track of every haircut that we ever had I could, I could see how long it had been, oh Oh, how long it had been And this thought made it clearer I ought to be near her All I see is where our days repeat And our love goes on As our hair grows long Oh, Chelsea Lynn I watched your hair grow from the root to tip I know, I know as I always have known And I always will know That I could have a single direction until I am dead I'll go, I'll go as I always have gone, and And I always will goI like
