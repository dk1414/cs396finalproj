Forgive me, Hera I cannot stay He cut out my tongue There is nothing to save Love me, oh Lord He threw me away He laughed at my sins In his arms, I must stay He wrote I am broke Please send for me But I am broken too And spoken for Do not tempt me Her skin is white And I'm light as the sun So holy light shines On the things you have done So I asked him how he became this man How did he learn to hold fruit in his hands And where is the lamb that gave you your name He had to leave, though I begged him to stay Left me alone when I needed the light Fell to my knees and I wept for my life If he had've stayed, you might understand If he had've stayed, you never would have taken my handThough they may want you to tread in their trail Only to see if the path they set fails Though they may want you to take off your clothes Whatever they think that the action exposed With your clothes on the floor Taking advice from some old balding bore You'll ask yourself, "Did I want this at all "Do you remember what I said The book I left by your bed The words that some survivor read Lately I've been thinking about our daughter growing old All of the bullshit that she might be told There's blood on the floor Maybe now you'll believe her for sure She remembers what I said The book I left by her bed The words that some survivor read Though they may take you for all you had left You won't be forgotten for what you had not done yet So you wished for a kiss from God And you mourned in your childish loss Innocence gone but it's not forgot You'll get your way through it somehowI woke up, it was four in the morning Clear as all hell that you'd already gone Your note said, "Dear, you know I hate to disappear But the days are short and the nights are getting long"And I just meant to tell you that I don't want to let you down And I just meant to tell you that I don't want to get you wrong Think about now with my legs wrapped around you How many times before have you seen me run It's a cruel kind of twist that you'd leave like this Just drop my wrist and say, "Well, that's us done"I was just gonna tell you that I don't want to let you down Get lost in the crowd Seen or unseen Say what you meanChasing down a wild fire Are you trying to make a cold liar out of me You want to get high You overcome those desires, before you come to me I think your mama’s kinda sad And your papa’s kinda mean I can take that all away You can stop playing it out on me Me, me She keeps a pen behind her ear In case she’s got something she really really needs to say She puts it in a notepad She's gonna write a book someday Of course the only part that I want to read Is about her time spent with me Wouldn’t you die to know how you're seen Are you getting away with who you’re trying to be Trying, trying to be Of course there’s things upon the Earth That we must really try to defend A lonely beast, a kind heart Something weak and on trendI drew pictures of you Long before I met you Just a fragment of my mind I had called out for you Almost every night Precious things are hard to find It was just an evening Much like any else When you came into my life It takes one to know one And I saw you there As I had seen you all my life I thank a God I've never met Never loved, never wanted I write it so I don't forget Never let it get away I wear a picture of you Just to keep you safe Mmm...Mmm.. I won't forget the late September Where we basked among the midnight embers But it's going like a half-remembered dream Left and north of where we met Thinking better of going west Yeah we lost each other in that river stream I thought I'd come and find you there Wait until you lost your hair And got your place out in the woods You're not afraid of trees or bears Or anything with tendencies To wanna hurt you good The only thing I learned in a year Where I didn't smile once, not really Nothing matters more than love, no Nothing, no, not nothing no, not nearly We've not got long, you know To bask in the afterglow Once it's gone, it's gone I won't forget the late September Where we danced among the midnight embers But it's going like a half-remembered dream Left and north of where we met Thinking better of going west Yeah we've lost each other in a river streamOh, my hopeless wanderer You can't come in You don't live here anymore Go, some creepy conjurer Who touched the rim Whose hands are in the door I need soothing My lips aren't moving My God is brooding Drawn in chalk across the floor You made it yours Your private door to my room May those who find you find remorse A change of course, a strange discord resolved I need soothing My lips aren't moving My God is brooding I banish you with love I banish you with love You can't come in You don't live here anymoreOnly the strong survive Only the strong survive Only the wrong relive their lives We've been here a thousand times Wish I could go back and find Letters I wrote you in my mind Perhaps I could unknot us from this awful bind Most I have forgot or overrefined Love is a sickness cured by time Love is a sickness cured by time Bruises all end up benign Love is a sickness cured by time I hope that you can change my mind Had to leave this crying all behind I hope that you don't think that I'm unkind So somebody told me, only and only Only the strong will survive Only the strong survive And I won't write a woman with a man on my mind Hope that didn't sound too unkind Just struggling to figure out how Only, only, only, only Only the strong can surviveWhat became of Alexandra Did she make it through What kind of woman gets to love you Wrote us all a little note Nothing left to lose What kind of woman gets to love you I need to know Where did Alexandra go Alexandra had no fear She lived out in the woods She'd tell you what you're doing wrong If she thinks she'll be understood Pulls her socks up to her knees Finds diamonds in the drain One more diamond to add to her chain I need to know Where does Alexandra go Where did Alexandra go Get all your records out and throw them all away No one left to listen to, much left, less to say Working hard and getting on, still not getting paid Stay low, keep brave Woke up in a country who refused to hold your hand Kept falling for narcissists who insist you call them 'man'You work late for a job you hate that's never fit the plan Stay low, keep brave I love you, my strange girl My lonely girl My angry girl My brave I love you, my strange girl My lonely girl My angry girl My brave Build yourself a garden and have something to attend Cut off all relations 'cause you could not stand your friends Announced yourself a socialist to have something to defend Oh yawn, girl, please don't bullshit me
