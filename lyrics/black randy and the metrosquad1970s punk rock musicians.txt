light the tiki Now the fire's getting hot, so let's throw them in the pot Idi I know, the jungle was all smiles When you fed the missionaries to the happy crocodiles Politicians and Jews all think

coons that think they're stars All of this, my secret scars I want to make it stop, I want to be a cop They come into my station, they say fill it up Little do they know, they're filling me up With envy and hate, I know that I can't wait I'm gonna mop the floor, then I won't work here anymore Way out in the dark, I wanna be a nark I'll have to go to school, and study real hard The day that I'm finished, I'll fill the prison yard Marijuana is the spark, heroin is the flame If your kid gets hooked, I'll find out who's to blame There'll be no safety for rock and roll trash When I put the cuffs on, they'd better have cash At the clubs where they play, at the motels where they stay When they see my car they'll know who's the star I'll wear Robert Hall suits and custom shirts And when I put the cuffs on, I'll be sure it hurts Sid and Nancy think they're in a safe place They'll soon know that I'm still working on their case I'll have secret keys to the Chelsea Hotel And all the O Ds I'll extradite from Hell
