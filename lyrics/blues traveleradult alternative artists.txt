Oh, once upon a midnight dearie I woke with something in my head I couldn't escape the memory Of a phone call and of what you said Like a game show contestant with a parting gift I could not believe my eyes When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend Who needs to humor me and tell me lies Yeah, humor me and tell me lies And I'll lie too and say I don't mind And as we seek, so shall we find And when you're feeling open, I'll still be here But not without a certain degree of fear Of what will be with you and me I still can see things hopefully But you Why you wanna give me a run-around Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up When all it does is slow me down And shake me and my confidence'Bout a great many things But I've been there, I can see it cower Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings Of a bad play where the heroes are right And nobody thinks or expects too much And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights Singing, "Hey babe, let's keep in touch Hey baby, let's keep in touch"But I want more than a touch, I want you to reach me And show me all the things no one else can see So what you feel becomes mine as well And soon if we're lucky, we'd be unable to tell What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line But you Why you wanna give me a run-around Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up When all it does is slow me down Ha la la la, bombardier, this is the pilot speaking And I got some news for you It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop And there ain't a whole lot that you can do Oh sure, the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder Perhaps I've grown a little cynical But I know no matter what the waitress brings I shall drink in and always be full Yeah, I will drink in and always be fullIt doesn't matter what I say So long as I sing with inflection That makes you feel I'll convey Some inner truth or vast reflection But I've said nothing so far And I can keep it up for as long as it takes And it don't matter who you are If I'm doing my job, it's your resolve that breaks Because the Hook brings you back I ain't tellin' you no lie The Hook brings you back On that you can rely There is something amiss I am being insincere In fact I don't mean any of this Still my confession draws you near To confuse the issue I'll refer To familiar heroes from long ago No matter how much Peter loved her What made the Pan refuse to growI lied and told her I loved her She didn't care, but anyway I told her we'd still be friends And she didn't care, but anyway I tried last week for to call her She wasn't home, but anyway I think I'll spend my life alone I really don't care right now, but anyway It's a state of affairs and a state of emotions The kind of thing that you must understand I tell you one thing; you tell me another We walk away, maybe then shake hands I'm quitting cigarette smoking It's bad for me, but anyway I don't think the T V was joking When it told me this, but anyway The newsman said not to sit on strange toilet seats It's my life he's trying to save, but anyway I found out that I've got eye cancer Too many television waves, but anyway It's a state of affairs and a state of emotions The kind of thing that you must understand I tell you one thing; you tell me another We walk away, maybe then shake handsYou'll get no answer from me About what I want or what I get Brave enough to speak, afraid to see Confuse the issue till you forget And I've tried To finally decide Why I'm in your face And if you can't already tell I am unable to let things go I'm told I do it very well But more important you should know That all the same You've got no one to blame But yourself If you call that a waste‘Cause it ain't me That's been hurting you inside And if you've learned You'll know much more than I That you're gonna have to go and find it I could dig beneath the ground You'll have to unearth every ugly stone That kept you on your own And simply put them down You're gonna have to look aroundA chance again to diatribe You'll go along if you've imbibed My mannered tones of dire cost And if something gets translated lost Again I seek to hide the same As though we've never stopped our game And all the tidings I could bring Have never really changed a thing Dependent on each other, we Kept infinite the you and me That never really set us free Or too lonely was the place we'd be But for all I've ever tried to tell you I just couldn't seem to say how much I care And speaking as the aspect that befell you You've come to mean my universe out there For all the right or wrong I'd done I had to share it with someone The true, the lie, the in between Their implications, what they mean A troubled tale or trophied turn Within my heart, they'd only burn'Til the echoes on the acetate Reveal what we can all relate Then freely we can share our pain And know that we are not insane Or at least a frenzy we can own It's enough for me, I'm not aloneIf ever you are feeling like you’re tired And all your uphill struggles leave you headed downhill If you realize your wildest dreams can hurt you And your appetite for pain is drinkin’ its fill I ask of you a very simple question Did you think for one minute that you are alone And is your suffering a privilege you share only Or did you think that everybody else feels completely at home Just wait Just wait Just wait And it will come If you think I’ve given up on you, you’re crazy And if you think I don’t love you well then you’re just wrong In time you just might take to feeling better Time is the beauty of the road being long I know that now you feel no consolation But maybe if I told you and informed you out loud I say this without fear of hesitation I can honestly tell you that you make me proud Just wait Just wait Just wait And it will come Just wait Just wait Just wait And it will come It’s comin’ onI said "I love you"She began to cry She said she needed a friend I said "I'll try"Soon we'd say nothing Somehow I never wondered why You see, she left me She left me I'm alone I'm alone I'm alone I'm alone I'd loved her always She didn't know I tried patience Let a friendship grow I tried to keep her That's what made her go You see, she left me She left me I'm alone I'm alone I'm alone I'm aloneStand Stand and walk Tragedy Is cheap and so is talk Decision Yours to make, what will you do In the end It comes back to you‘Cause it's a long way to fall Thunder Don't scare me at all Lightning Well just a little Pressure It ain't worth a dime And your wounds They'll all heal in time‘Cause it's a long way to fall The answers are getting harder The answers are getting harder The answers are getting harder The answers are getting harder The answers are getting harderDon't you give up, don't allow disaster Don't you give up, don't you let her win We're talking about a "forever after"Don't you give up, don't you dare give in Don't you give up, don't you dare give in Doesn't it seem most precarious Doesn't it seem such a chance to take Doesn't it seem most precarious Why does it feel like a big mistake Please understand and hear what I'm saying The time is now and you don't have long She could be oceans away tomorrow So soon your chance will have come and gone So soon your chance will have come and gone Doesn't it seem most precarious Doesn't it seem such a chance to take Doesn't it seem most precarious Why does it feel like a big mistake The tight-wire’s strung and you're out in the middle All eyes upon you, no net below Inches to go and you're almost home free Feel the wires swinging to and fro Feel the wires swinging to and froHear the drivers of the window When you listen to cars Mad accelerations Showing who they are Urgency in their aggression As they fight to make it home Loud in their confessional It's an endless conversation Rumbling out across the land Accelerated nation Put a wheel in every hand White line was a fever Now it's spread the whole world wide Each private true believer Come together to collide In every tree, there is a forest Every bee, there is a hive Every universe before us Unmistakably alive When you factor in survival Selfishly, you'll see the sun It's just the dream of one arrival Making all the engines run
