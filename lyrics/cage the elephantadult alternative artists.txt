Did you stand there all alone Oh, I cannot explain what's going down I can see you standing next to me In and out somewhere else right now You sigh, look away I can see it clear as day Close your eyes, so afraid Hide behind that baby face Do-do-do, do-do-do You can drive all night Looking for the answers in the pouring rain You wanna find peace of mind Looking for the answer Funny how it seems like yesterday As I recall, you were looking out of place Gathered up your things and slipped away No time at all, I followed you into the hall Cigarette daydreams You were only seventeen So sweet with a mean streak Nearly brought me to my kneesOoh, ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh We were at the table by the window with the view Casting shadows, the sun was pushing through Spoke a lot of words, I don't know if I spoke the truth Got so much to lose Got so much to prove God, don't let me lose my mind Trouble on my left, trouble on my right I've been facing trouble almost all my life My sweet love, won't you pull me through Everywhere I look, I catch a glimpse of you I said it was love and I did it for life, didn't do it for youTime shakes, found you at the water At first you were my father And now I love you like a brother Earthquakes shake the dust behind you This world at times will blind you Still I know I'll see you there Come a little closer, then you'll see Come on, come on, come on Things aren't always what they seem to be Come on, come on, come on Do you understand the things that you've been seein'?Come on, come on, come on Do you understand the things that you've been dreamin'?Come a little closer, then you'll see Heartbreaks, the heavy world's upon your shoulders Will we burn on or just smolder Somehow I know I'll find you there Ooh, you wanna see if you can change it, change it Still I know I'll see you there Come a little closer, then you'll see Come on, come on, come on Things aren't always what they seem to be Do you understand the things that you've been seein'?Come on, come on, come on Do you understand the things that you've been dreamin'?Come a little closer, then you'll see Come a little closer, then you'll seeI was walking down the street when out the corner of my eye I saw a pretty little thing approaching me She said, "I never seen a man, who looks so all alone Oh, could you use a little company If you pay the right price, your evening will be nice And you can go and send me on my way."I said, "You're such a sweet young thing, why you do this to yourself "She looked at me and this is what she said:"Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked Money don't grow on trees I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed There ain't nothing in this world for free Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back Though you know, I wish I could Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked Until we close our eyes for good"Not even fifteen minutes later I'm still walking down the street When I saw the shadow of a man creep out out of sight And then he swept up from behind, he put a gun up to my head He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight He said, "Give me all you've got, I want your money, not your life But if you try to make a move, I won't think twice"I told him, "You can have my cash, but first you know I gotta ask What made you want to live this kind of life "In a far and distant galaxy Inside my telescope I see A pair of eyes peer back at me He walks and talks and looks like me He sits around inside his house From room to room, he moves about Fills his life with pointless things And wonders how it all turns out Do-do-do-do-do-do Do-do-do-do-do-do It's safe to say that I don't think you understand There's nowhere left to turn, the walls keep breaking Time is like a leaf in the wind Either it's time well spent or time I've wasted Don't waste it Afraid of what the truth might bring He locks his doors and never leaves Desperately searching for signs Too terrified to find a thing He battens all the hatches down And wonders why he hears no sounds Frantically searching his dreams He wonders what it's all aboutDoctor, look into my eyes I've been breathing air, but there's no sign of life Doctor, the problem's in my chest My heart feels cold as ice, but it's anybody's guess Doctor, can you help me  'Cause I don't feel right Better make it fast before I change my mind Doctor, can you help me  'Cause I don't feel right Better make it fast before I change my mind Well, it's cold, cold, cold, cold inside Darker in the day than the dead of night Cold, cold, cold, cold inside Doctor, can you help me  'Cause something don't feel right Something don't feel right Sweet nurse, don't look at me that way I've seen those eyes before, I can tell you want to play Counselor, give me some advice Tell me, how hard will I fall if I live a double life Doctor, can you help me  'Cause I don't feel right Better make it fast before I change my mind Doctor, can you help me  'Cause I don't feel right Better make it fast, because there ain't much timeSun went down, sun went down over Pompeii On both sides, a vow was broken Oh my, my, I'm the one Trying to hide this damage done One day, all our secrets will be spoken As we slow danced, I became your statue, frozen Times I wonder are we just a puff of smoke  Yeah Underneath this bed of ashes, still withholding everything Like we were never close Don’t you worry, baby, no sense trying to change it I'ma strike these matches, never had control I'm ready to let go, no, was I fooling myself I’ma spread these ashes, never had control I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready to let go Sun went down, sun went down over Pompeii On holy ground, our vows were broken We met up, we broke bread I was blue, your dress was red Ain't it strange We both knew this day was comingI think it's strange when people say You're the next big thing, you'll never fade The slightest touch, forced to fold Sleight of the hand, modern gold Starry-eyed child left behind Choose your favorite vice I don't have the strength to play nice Hide me in the back room, tell me when it's over Don't know if I can play this part much longer I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over Don't know if I can play this part much longer I don't know if it is right to live this way, yeah I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over People always say, "Man, at least you're on the radio"At least you're on the radio, oh At least you're on the radio, huh At least you're on the radio, oh Close your eyes, don't be afraid Take some of these, they'll ease the pain Live fast, die young, pay the price The best die young, immortalizedOh my precious ember burning, my sweet glowing light From the moment I first saw you, I was yours and you were mine Deep down we both knew you were trouble by design And the echo of my mother's words, "Baby, don't you play with fire"I was always playing the part First love only set by a spark There was no way changing my mind Now I'm under your spell, trapped in a lie Shouldn't have stood that close to the fire No turning back, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide It's too late to say goodbye Push back from my heart Wish we could go back to the start But oh my god, is this real No more time It's too late, it's too late to say goodbye I can hear the sounds of sirens circling around Forced to watch the ashes floating, softly drifting to the ground Deep down we both knew it was trouble by design And the echo of my mother's words, "Baby, don't you play with fire"Sweetie Little Jean, where did you go Everyone's been searching high and low And your mother's worried sick Dearest daddy lost his grip While the whole world's watching Candlelight vigils being held in silence On the channel four And they've knocked on every door Every place you've been before How long will we let it go I think we should just let go I, I want you back Let's get back Lay my weary head against your bones Where all my troubles will be dead and gone How long will we let it go I think we should just let go Has melancholy taken you for good You know that I would save you if I could Watched your laughter turn to tears Then you vanished in thin air Well we pinned your missing persons picture up On every mother-loving post How's it feel to be a ghost You're the one I love the most
