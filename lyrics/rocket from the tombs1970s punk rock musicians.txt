Ain't it fun when you're always on the run Ain't it fun when your friends despise what you've become Ain't it fun when you get so high that you can't come Ain't it fun when you know that you're gonna die young It's such fun Ain't it fun when you taking care of number one Ain't it fun when you feel like you just gotta get a gun Ain't it fun when you just can't find your tongue Cause you stuck it way too deep into something that really stung It's such fun Somebody came to me and spit right in my face I didn't even feel it It was such a disgrace I broke the window, smashed my fist right through the glass I couldn't even feel it It happened too fast Such fun Ain't it fun when you tell her she's just a cunt Ain't it fun when you she splits and leaves you on the bum Well, Ain't it fun when you broken up every thing that you ever done Ain't it fun when you know that you're gonna die youngI don't need anyone Don't need no mom and dad Don't need no pretty face Don't need no human race I got some news for you Don't even need you too I got my devil machine Got my electronic dream Sonic reducer Ain't no loser Got my sonic reducer Ain't no loser People out on the streets They don't know who I am I watch them from my room They just pass me by I'm not just anyone I'm not just anyone I got my devil machine Got my electronic dream Sonic reducer Ain't no loser Got my sonic reducer Ain't no loserAin't it fun when you're always on the run Ain't it fun when your friends despise what you've become Ain't it fun when you get so high that you can't come Ain't it fun when you know that you're gonna die young It's such fun Such fun Ain't it fun when you feel that you just gotta buy a gun Ain't it fun 'cause you're taking care of number one Ain't it fun when you just-just-just can't find your tongue 'Cause you stuck it way too deep in something that really stung Ain't it fun It's such fun It's such fun, fun, fun, fun, fun Somebody came to me and they spit right in my face But I didn't even feel it, it was such a disgrace I broke the window, smashed my fist right through the glass But I couldn't even feel it, it just happened too fastThe girls won't touch me cause I got a misdirection And livin at night isn't helpin my complexion The signs all say it's a social infection A little bit of fun's never been an insurrection Mom threw me out til I get some pants that fit She just don't approve of my strange kind of wit I get so excited I always gotta lose it Then they pack me off & make me take the cure But I don't need a cure Don't need a cure Don't need a cure Need a final solution Buy me a ticket to a sonic reduction Guitars gonna sound like a nuclear destruction It seems I'm the victim of natural selection Or maybe just another slide in another direction I don't need a cure Don't need a cure Don't need a cure Need a final solution Solution Well I know is very hard to believe When the suicide takin' deep And it's also very hard to perceive That if maybe you're out in your sleep Suicide thoughts goin' through my head And I'm thinkin' 'bout chickenin' out But who would throw a lifetime out the window For just a few seconds of doubt I'm never gonna kill myself again Don't you know I'm never gonna kill myself again Don't you think sex is soon kinda cool Just the tone I really like And you know sex is soon kinda naughty We're not doin' it right But if you're really gonna kill yourself Well, just do it in style And if you're rеally gonna kill yourself I wanna read it in the papеrs and smile I'm never gonna kill myself again Don't you know I'm never gonna kill myself again I'm never gonna kill myself again Don't you know I'm never gonna kill myself again Flew off early in the haze of dawn In a metal dragon locked in time Skimming waves of an underground sea In some kind of a dream world fantasy30 seconds And a one way ride30 seconds And no place to hide Sun a hot circle on a canopy'25 a racing blot on a bright green sea Ahead the dim blur of an alien land Time to give ourselves to strange gods' hands30 seconds And a one way ride30 seconds And no place to hide Dark flak spiders bursting in the sky Reaching twisted claws on every side No place to run No place to hide No turning back on a suicide rideI'm a street walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm I'm a runaway son of the nuclear a-bomb I am a world's forgotten boy The one who searches and destroys Honey, gotta help me please Somebody gotta save my soul Baby, detonate for me Look out honey 'cause I'm using technology Ain't got time to make no apology Soul radiation in the dead of night Love in the middle of a fire fight Honey, gotta strike me blind Somebody gotta save my soul Baby, penetrate my mind I'm a street walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm I'm a runaway son of the nuclear a-bomb I am a world's forgotten boy The one who searches and destroys And I'm the world's forgotten boy The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy And honey, I'm the world's forgotten boy The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroyTake the guitar player for a ride He's never once been satisfied Thinks he owes some kind of debt It'll take him years to get over it When you feel so green Turn to your movie scene And you won't know what I mean But you don't know where I've been I get so easily excited It's like having a party when you aren't invited I took the kid down to the harbor inn Oh, but the cops they wouldn't let him in But he's used to being turned away He's gonna show them one fine day When you're shifting phase And you don't control who plays And all that purple haze It's like a game that you play and you're playin', and you're playin', and you're playin', and you're playin'I get so easily excited It's like having a party when you aren't invitedLife stinks I'm seeing pink I can't wink I can't blink I like the Kinks I need a drink I can't think I like the Kinks Life stinksAin't it fun when you're always on the run Ain't it fun when your friends despise what you've become Ain't it fun when you get so high that you can't come Ain't it fun when you know that you're gonna die young It's such fun Ain't it fun when you taking care of number one Ain't it fun when you feel like you just gotta get a gun Ain't it fun when you just can't find your tongue Cause you stuck it way too deep into something that really stung It's such fun Somebody came to me and spit right in my face I didn't even feel it It was such a disgrace I broke the window, smashed my fist right through the glass I couldn't even feel it It happened too fast Such fun Ain't it fun when you tell her she's just a cunt Ain't it fun when you she splits and leaves you on the bum Well, Ain't it fun when you broken up every thing that you ever done Ain't it fun when you know that you're gonna die young
