There are parts of me he'll never know My wild horses and my river beds And in my throat voices he'll never hear He pulls at me like a cherry tree And I can still move, but I don't speak about it Pretend I'm crazy, pretend I'm dead He's to scared to hit me now, he'll bring flowers instead I need an island, somewhere to sink a stone I need an island, somewhere to bury you Somewhere to go And the dogwoods shimmer in October sun"Oh sweet thing" he sings to me, "You're the only one."I need an island, somewhere to sink a stone I need an island, somewhere to bury you, somewhere I need an island, somewhere to sink a stone I need an island, somewhere to bury you, somewhere to go And I don't know why I can't tell my sister He spat in my face again, and I don't want to die here You know that dream when your feet won't move You want to come but your body won't let you He steals it from me  He steals it from me It shines like sweat, like jewels Like something that has died to soon He fucks with the beauty A kiss, a kick, a kiss, a kick, a kiss kiss kick He steals it from me It's out of my hands againWishful thinking I might be yours Drifting on every step I'm always drawn to the dark horse Sweet, sweet , oh nothing's said And every dream, every, is just a dream after all And everything stands so still when you dance Everything spins so fast And the night's in a paper cup When you want it to last Wishful thinking you might be mine Every shiver sends One breath under the bridge of sighs Bending where the river bends And every dream, every, is just a dream after all And everything stands so still when you dance Everything spins so fast And the night's in a paper cup When you want it to lastSunday is Gloomy My hours are slumberless Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless Little white flowers will never awaken you Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you Angels have no thought of ever returning you Would they be angry if I thought of joining you Gloomy Sunday Gloomy is Sunday In shadows I spend it all My heart and I have decided to end it all Soon there'll be candels and prayers that are sad I know, let them not weep Let them know that I'm glad to go Death is no dream For in death I'm caressing you With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you Gloomy Sunday Dreaming I was only dreaming I wake and I find you Asleep in the deep of My heart DearI put my hands Where your wings should be I put my feet Where the earth should be And I can't see very far And when you said that you were dead I hung on Something I feel You are an angel, or maybe you could've been Something out here You are an angel, or maybe you could've been I've got this light Hangs over me I've got this fear Cuts into me And I can't see very far And when you said that you were dead I hung on Something I feel You are an angel, or maybe you could've been Something out here You are an angel, or maybe you could've beenI saw a mountain from higher above I held your hand and I was doubled up in love Big sky above me, a river inside me And I'm doubled up in love You're watching your step but you fall as you're walking You take it in stride but still you fall as you're walking Big sky above me, a river inside me And I'm doubled up in love Feels good it feels like poetry Don't ask me to explain it just Feels good, like poetry I'm doubled up again Look at the sky Lift off like an aeroplane Watch the ground come up to meet you Big sky above me, a river inside me And I'm doubled up in love Feels good, it feels like poetry Don't ask me to explain it just Feels good, like poetry I'm doubled up againSometime i can feel you breathing into me And these hands i can feel them tugging at my sleeve I move through the day in the rhythms that i've known I've got this crazy dream of stripping down to truth and bone All of it, all of it, all of it stripped down All of it, all of it, all of it, to truth and bone My mouth is full of secrets i'm too afraid to tell My body's full of longing for you to know me well I move through the day in the rhythms that i've known I've got this crazy dream of stripping down to thruth and bone All of it, all of it, all of it stripped down All of it, all of it, all of it, to truth and bone I think of sinking in way over my shoulders Let the water, the water take me in and i Need you to cut through to where i'm hidden I'm awkward and i'm too polite and i want Two stars for arms like orion i could Breathe in and breathe in and breathe out If i could only lose myself I would lose myself in you I move trough the day in the rhythms that i've known I've got this crazy dream of stripping down to truth and boneI carry you with me A ghost inside And in these shattered arms You're still alive I carry you with me A holy shrine And dogs and angels follow Right behind Could I be walking higher Could I be right beside her The bones they buried Will feed the trees But every word you ever spoke Is still in me Could I be walking higher Could I be right beside her And I will feel for you in the music And I will send that river home And I will cry for you sometimes When the night is down And I raise my head up to the mountains Talk to the birds and I fly'Cause the spirit lives on When the body diesEat your words, eat your heart out Eat your words, eat your heart out There's not much left, just my red dress Just this feeling that I got You made me a victim in your Christmas kitchen It's my memory it's your loss Blue black, maybe you got something But the flowers grew back And was it familiar when you touched my sister God, I don't think there's a word for that Blue black, maybe you got something But the flowers grew black I gave it away, whore for a day It's so ugly, I'm still breathing But you never got my virgin heart It stayed locked up, it's still beating Blue black, maybe you got something But the flowers grew black Eat your words, eat your hat Eat your words, eat your heart outYou found me Drifting Big motion like a bird Strangest song i ever heard Now, now that you're here Stay with me light years Light years, light years No paper, no ring In the trees where frogs sing I brought lillies for you Think of all the things were gonna do Now, now that you're here Stay with me ligt years I give you a thousand hours Making love in the tall sunflowers I give you a thousand feet Down were the water's deep Sleepy storm, sleepy head Limb for limb on my bed Now, now that you're here Stay with me light years Light years, light years Light years, stay with me Stay with me, stayMorning is almost here, let it wait I just want to lie here a while, tempting fate I don't think I could breathe now with you gone But it's not weakness it's just something I've begun Maybe there's a light that's always on Maybe we're not only human Maybe there's a light that's always on And we're not only human When you're sleeping your ceramic You're surrounded by little stars Every shimmer is a searchlight Every planet is ours Change the street, change the decade Still the longing's left inside But why am I too small to carry you Why does twilight make me cry Maybe there's a light that's always on Maybe we're not only human Maybe there's a light that's always on And we're not only human When all is said and done When all the weight is gone When all is said and done When all the weight is gone We're not only human
