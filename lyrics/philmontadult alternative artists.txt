They have calculated outcomes We just pray the numbers lied It's all calm here on the surface But a war rages inside And she lays still tonight She lays still tonight Pull me closer while I count the days Until I see Your face'Til I look into Your eyes When I'm tired You can carry me'Til I see Your face'Til I look into Your eyes Well we can fire back Another plan of attack Something to tip the scales in our favor again If were expecting less We just allow the glass to drain empty Through the cracks in the bottom And wash away Don't wash away, tonightOne, two, three, four, five, six Yellow diamonds in the light And we're standing side by side As your shadow crosses mine What it takes to come alive It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny But I've gotta let it go We found love in a hopeless place We found love in a hopeless place We found love in a hopeless place We found love in a hopeless place Shine a light through an open door Love and life I will divide Turn away cause I need you more Feel the heartbeat in my mind It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny But I've gotta let it go We found love in a hopeless place We found love in a hopeless place We found love in a hopeless place We found love in a hopeless placeStaring at the bedroom ceiling Wondering if I'll start dreaming But my doubts and fears won't let me be These questions burn I toss and turn In hope of finding peace Your words keep ringing through my head Calling me, calling me I feel the weight of what you've said Come to me, come to me and you'll find rest You will find rest I love to talk but I hate to listen I wanna move but I need direction This endless search for answers Has torn mе down and now I've found It's leading back to you Your words keep ringing through my head Calling mе, calling me I feel the weight of what you've said Come to me, come to me and you'll find rest You will find restI've been thinking lately how time keeps moving on Can't believe the summer's come and gone I'd hate to think I've wasted chances to convey What we both know but I don't always say And I just need to know you're listening If this is the last song that I sing Let it be honest Let it be true If this is the last song that I sing I want it to say I love you I love you Seems our time together is easily consumed Listening to everything that I've been going through I'm so tired of the thief that I've becomе I'm ready now to change my ways Sorry that it took so long If this is the last song that I sing Lеt it be honest Let it be true If this is the last song that I sing I want it to say I love you I love you I love youThe problem is the alchemy It just might be the death of me'Cause I know that I'm stuck But I'm not giving up that easy I know there's got to be a way To mix these things and somehow make The perfect recipe There simply has to be For years I've been a scientist Respected and esteemed This lab became my home These formulas are my family When I'm sought out to find a cause It simply means one thing Failure's not allowed The truth will be revealed to me I've found the answer It's not what I was searching for, no It seems science can't explain In full detail everything to me My work has been in vain There's no way to replicate these things I've put stock in things now vanishing Invested time and energy This fleeting world it flies by too soon And I've focused on the past alas It seems these things weren't built to last I watch them fall and crumble next to you The burdens that we carry are all temporary Photographs and memories will fade The storms we're left to weather will not last forever When all is said and done you will remain When all is said and done you will remain We're passengers transitioning From highs to lows and in between Exhausted by the search it seems we're spent To dwell to keep it in my mind Ensures that I'd be left behind Confused by life and asking where it went The burdens that we carry are all temporary Photographs and memories will fade The storms we're left to weather will not last forever When all is said and done you will remain When all is said and doneI am a fuse lit burn and glow So you'd better get away If you can't defuse I will explode Look at this mess I've made I am the hero I am the snake caught in both lives Look past the fangs and just see the cape We'll pretend that it's alright But you see who I am Underneath it all I am redemption I am whole I am a tragic wreck made perfect by a love I can't control I am determined to be defined by my hits not just my misses Stand up tall and say that this is who I am I am addiction Wrapped in a blanket of self control That's worn so thin and tattered that The air seeps through the holes I am admission To a history of falling short A past that's held me captive from accepting I am yours I am yours underneathThe terminal leaves behind Half-smiles and drying eyes With ticket clutched in hand I long to find my way back home But even from way up here The view isn't all that clear What good is this perspective If I can't tell where to go I can't tell where to go You're looking down on me Lost and incomplete Desperate to make things The way I think they ought to be But You've got a different way You've seen all my mistakes You're asking me to leave the pieces where they lay You take my hand, we turn and walk away The turbulence shakes the room The passengers and the crew With armrest clutched in hand I long to regain some control But as I relax my grip I realize the truth of it I'm just as powerless when I am on the ground belowFor every action, a reaction But these formulas don't work with You I trust myself with myself But there's just no hope for me to make it through It's only something You can do I am not the answer Always caught in my disasters But You, You know me by heart I am ready if You're willing To make this more than just a feeling'Cause You know me by my heart Show me where to start Am I able or unstable Can You tell me what this life is all about Can You trust me  Am I worthy 'Cause sometimes it's just so hard to figure out Will You clear my head of every doubt I am not the answer Always caught in my disasters But You, You know me by heart I am ready if You're willing To make this more than just a feeling'Cause You know me by my heart Show me where to startAnchors away This extra weight is pulling down on me It's drowning me And now it's overboard with the necessities There's no room for You to come aboard I'm setting off, setting off to sea In a boat that's filled from bow to stern With things that I don't need The smallest waves are crashing over me Soon my muffled cries as I capsize Will be all that's left My problems always lie In failed attempts to hide The ways that I rely On my dumb luck Oh God, I feel my grip Begin to slowly slip And now this sinking ship's As good as sunk There's no room for You to come aboard So just wait right here till I return to shore
