You're my last breath You're a breath of fresh air to me I am empty So tell me you care for me You're the first thing And the last thing on my mind In your arms I feel Sunshine All the promise A daydream yet to come Time is upon us Oh but the night is young Flowers blossom In the wintertime In your arms I feel Sunshine Give up yourself unto the moment The time is now Give up yourself unto the moment Let's make this moment lastWhen you are ready I will surrender Take me and do as you wish Have what you want Your way's always the best way I have succumbed to This passive sensation Peacefully falling away I am a zombie Your wish will command me Laugh as I fall to my knees Can I control This empty delusion Lost in the fire below And you come running Your eyes will be open And when you come back I'll be as you want me Only so eager to please My little song will Keep you beside me Thinking your name as I singNothing can come close Nothing can come close Nothing can come close I never doubted it What's for you will not pass you by I never questioned it It was decided before I asked why It's all there ever was And it's all there ever will be How could you have questioned us It's yourself you deceive Nothing can come close To this familiar feeling We say it all without Ever speaking Nothing can come close To this familiar feeling We say it all without Ever speaking Nothing can come close To this familiar feeling We say it all without Ever speaking Nothing can come close To this familiar feeling We say it all without Ever speakingYou're my last breath You're a breath of fresh air to me I am empty So tell me you care for me You're the first thing And the last thing on my mind In your arms I feel Sunshine All the promise A daydream yet to come Time is upon us Oh but
