The only rhyme that bites Step back while I attack the mic Demon rhymes like a script from Fright Night Wrote like a poet Designed like a sculptor Carved from steel ‘cause strength is my culture Slip in my clip automatic fully loaded Lyrics like lead and beats my component Put together like a ten foot sledgehammer Rock the 24 track like an earth tremor Now I'm equipped, tooled up to the front teeth Exceed my limits with a rhyme and a firm belief That I am unstoppable, chew punks up like cannibal Don't like what I say  Then sue me for libel So step it up to a canter like a stallion My boys' title is Manchester's battalion Now you've heard the north at its heights The drums rumble and you know the rhyme bites The only rhyme that bites The only rhyme that bites Get down And my boys lay beats like bricks and I'm kicking Bass so sharp take your head off And then lay down the cut, rewind and hut Now do you dig it ‘cause the beat drop will kick But the overload is too much to handle Volume increases as I dismantle I pack jams like a party in a tin can Leave you to chill like a fridge in a mean van You get the urge like a surge of adrenalin Lose you mind ‘cause you know there's never been A pale face lover of the nineties, the governor Those weak hearted just might not recover Now you know the rhyme's unbelievable The blood thumps and my punches do not pull Cos I'm the dan, more fibre than Hi-Bran Ask if I rock, say sure I can I am the host, a killer with an attitude Stomp holes in heads at the hint of a feud I hit rhymes out like steel trucks You dig it like a point of a meat hook Roll to you like a concrete baseball Make noise like a battle in a pub brawl The only rhyme that bites The only rhyme that bites Give it up to me Wind it up Here we go One more time I'm a human funk box And I commence with a gear change First the fourth, bust punks into grass stains Beats my belief, sounds my religion Don't chase trends ‘cause tunes is originality So come follow me On the mic I'll fright, make the sight right Leave you chill ‘cause cool is my blood type Now from the waist release with a hip thrust Rock the rest and loosen the body rust I make you glide ride like a low tide My home gets credit for what I've devised Cos I'm a Mancunian house jammer Rough and ready, but look good for the camera Now understand what you see is what you get I'm nineteen and classed in my own set Tunes connect perfect up to the sound check The rap is written, revised and comes correct The race is on for the title, so come on Run from dish just collect the corn I come across with vibrance, especially when silence Comes to the room a tune acapella boom I'm the battleship, my rhyme is the warhead No rap is too bad, it's just too dead The only rhyme that bites This bites Just lyrics I've written Not rhymes I've bitten Check it out Here we go One two one two three and Release the leather make it clever fill in with terror Insult me, you're directed to take a header Into a cess pit, now eat it Perfect time like a well-rehearsed card trick I'll flush you out shuffle then deck you Run a ton then deal you Spread your ass all over the felt Skin you clean like a buffalo pelt You melt with the heat catch friction off my static Baffle all punk confusion is my tactic Hate no-one but feel sorry for dickheads Don't rhyme in time, they just waffle instead Those who can't funk, why don't they funk off Get off the tip so rap takes its real course Instead of hip-house make hip-hop the real thing Murderous bass and a beat that swings I'm devastating, a god-child in the making What you hear's a lethal style of conversation T for terminator U for undertaker N inoculator E for educator S for sadistic Now what you think of it The only rhyme that bites The only rhyme that bitesDon’t call me nothing but killer So chill out, don’t stop my rhyme flow I’ll keep you kicking like a trail of dominoes I separate all the prime from the punk Inoculating all the funk from the junk We bust drums every time we make a track They call me Tunes, or the microphone maniac When I perform all suckers feel reborn Preach my rhyme so we can get it on I’ll make you shake Like paper I will penetrate Pierce your skin, make your whole body pulsate Credit comes with my effect on people Dance to death and this is the sequel So get flat hit the dirt like a doormat Make you dizzy, so the crowd has a relapse What we devise, it hits you like a vodka Slam dunk punk and I’ve got you Now stand back jack and give me a hand Rock and roll to my new style funk band We bust drums every time we make a track They call me Tunes, or the microphone maniac Dance yourself to death Dance yourself to deathThe only rhyme that bites Step back while I attack the mic Demon rhymes like a script from
