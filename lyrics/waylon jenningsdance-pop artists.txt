I'm for law and order The way that it should be This song's about the night they spent Protecting you from me Someone called us outlaws In some old magazine New York sent a posse down Like I ain't never seen Don't you think this outlaw shit Has gotten out of hand What started out to be a joke The law don't understand Was it singing through my nose That got me busted by the man This ain't it, this outlaw shit Has gotten out of hand Out of hand Out of hand We were wrapped up in the music That's why we never saw The cars pull up, the boys get out And the room fill up with law They came pounding through the back door In the middle of my song They got me for possession Of something that was long goneCowboys ain't easy to love And they're harder to hold They'd rather give you a song Than diamonds or gold Lonestar belt buckles and old faded Levis And each night begins a new day If you don't understand him and he don't die young He'll probably just ride away Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys'Cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone Even with someone they love Cowboys like smoky old pool rooms And clear mountain mornings Little warm puppies and children And girls of the night Them that don't know him Won't like him and them that do Sometimes won't know how to take him He ain't wrong, he's just different But his pride won't let him Do things to make you think he's rightLord, it's the same old tune, fiddle and guitar Where do we take it from here Rhinestone suits and new shiny cars It's been the same way for years We need to change Somebody told me when I came to Nashville"Son, you finally got it made!Old Hank made it here, we're all sure that you will"But I don't think Hank done it this way, no I don't think Hank done it this way, okay Ten years on the road making one night stands Speeding my young life away Tell me one more time, just so's I'll understand Are you sure Hank done it this way Did old Hank really do it this a-way Lord, I've seen the world with a five-piece band Looking at the back side of me Singing my songs and one of his now and then But I don't think Hank done 'em this way, no I don't think Hank done 'em this wayA long time forgotten Our dreams had just fell by the way And the good life he promised Ain't what she's livin' today But she never complains of the bad times Or bad things he's done Lord, she just talks about the good times they've had And all the good times to come She's a good hearted woman In love with a good timin' man She loves him in spite of his ways That she don't understand Through teardrops and laughter They'll pass through this world, hand in hand A good hearted woman Lovin' her good timin' man He likes the night life and bright lights And good timin' friends When the party's all over She'll welcome him back home again Lord knows she don't understand him But she does the best that she can'Cause she's a good hearted woman She loves her good timin' manI looked for trouble and I found it, son Straight down the barrel of a lawman's gun I tried to run but I don't think I can"You make one move and you're a dead man, friend"Ain't living long like this Can't live at all like this, can I baby He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back Then left me reeling on a steel rail rack They got 'em all in the jailhouse, baby Ain't living long like this Can't live at all like this, can I baby Grew up in Houston off of Wayside Drive Son of a carhop at some all night dive Dad drove a stock car to an early death All I remember was a drunk man's breath Ain't living long like this Can't live at all like this, can I baby You know the story how the wheel goes 'round Don't let them take you to the man downtown Can't sleep at all in a jailhouse baby Ain't living long like this Can't live at all like this, can I baby Low down leavin' sun I've done did everything that needs done Woe is me, why can't i see I'd best be leavin' well enough alone Them neon light nights, couldn't stay out of fights Keep a-hauntin' me in memories Well, there's one in every crowd, for cryin' out loud Why was it always turnin' out to be me Where does it go, the good Lord only knows It seems like it was just the other day I was down at Green Gables, a hawkin' them tables And generally blowin' all my hard earned pay Piano roll blues, danced holes in my shoes There weren't another other way to be For lovable losers, no account boozers And honky tonk heroes like meOn a Greyhound bus Lord, I'm traveling this morning I'm going to Shreveport And down to New Orleans Been traveling these highways Been doing things my way It's been making me lonesome, ornery, and mean Now her hair was jet black And her name was Codeine She thought she was the cream Of the Basin Street Queens She got tired of that smoky wine dream Began to feel lonesome, ornery, and mean We got together And we cashed in our sweeps Gave 'em to a beggar Who was mumblin' through the streets There's no escaping from his snowy white dreams Born lookin' lonesome, ornery, and meanI've been down to Mississippi Down through New Orleans Yes I have I've played in California There ain't too much I haven't seen No there ain't Lord, I'm a ramblin' man Don't fool around with a ramblin' man Left a girl in West Virginia Up there where that green grass grows Yes I did Got a girl in Cincinatti Waitin' where the Ohio River flows Oh, girl I'm a ramblin' man Don't give your heart to a ramblin' man You better move away You're standing too close to the flame Once I mess with your mind Your little  heart won't be the same But I'm a ramblin' man Don't mess around with and ol' ramblin' man You better not Well, up in Chicago I was known as quite a boy Yes I was Down in Alabama They call me the man of joy Still do Well, I'm a ramblin' man Don't fall in love with a ramblin' manLong ago and far away In my ol' common labor shoes I turned the world all which a way Just because you asked me to Like unto no other feel Simple love is simple true There's no end to what I'd do Just because you asked me to Let the world call me a fool But if things are right with me and you That's all that matters And I'll do anything you asked me to Knowing how much I love you And after all that I've been through I'd turn and walk away from you Just because you asked me to Let the world call me a fool But if things are right with me and you That's all that matters And I'll do anything you asked me toThree fingers whiskey pleasures the drinkers And moving does more than the same thing for me Willy he tells me that doers and thinkers Say moving is the closest thing to being free Well he's rosined his riggings and laid back his wages He's dead set on ridin' the big rodeo My woman's tight with an overdue baby And Willy keeps yelling, "Hey, Gypsy, let's go"Willy, you're wild as a Texas Blue Norther Ready rolled from the same makings as me Well, I reckon we're gonna ramble 'til Hell freezes over Willy the wandering Gypsy and me Now, ladies, we surely will take of your favors And we'll surely warn you there never will be A single soul living that could put brand or handle On Willy the wandering Gypsy and me We'll dance on the mountains, shout in the canyons And swarm in a loose herd like wild buffalo Jammin' our heads full of figures and angles And tellin' us stuff that we already know
