My pappy said, "Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln."Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod race When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace That story is true, I'm here to say I was drivin' that Model A It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up That Model A body makes it look like a pup It's got eight cylinders; uses them all It's got overdrive, just won't stall With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust With 4.11 gears you can really get lost It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared The brakes are good, tires fair Pulled out of San Pedro late one night The moon and the stars was shinin' bright We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill Passing cars like they was standing still All of a sudden in a wink of an eye A Cadillac sedan passed us by I said, "Boys, that's a mark for me!"By then the taillight was all you could seeNew Mexico rain falls on my windshield I'm ridin' the line with Jose Cuervo The radio says it's five in the

every drunk that I've heard holler Every knocked-out barroom brawler sleepin' off the fight For all the stories I've been told I guess I'd have a pot of gold If even just a single one had turned out to be right Playin' me some honky-tonk music That's the kind I like to play Playin' me some honky-tonk music That's the kind I like to play I've seen a lotta girls get lied to And even several times I

gets on the stand Then when he plays, he gets a hand The rhythm he beats puts the cats in a trance Nobody there bothers to dance But when he plays with the bass and guitar They holler out, "Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"A-plink, a-plank, a-plink plank, plink plank A-plunkin' on the keys A-riff, a-raff, a-riff raff, riff raff A-riffin' out with ease And when he plays with the bass and guitar
