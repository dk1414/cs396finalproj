of the sentimental crap Cool if you into that Fuck all of these subs, who they intended at I won't believe it's me without forensic facts They don't normally mention Black when pennin' their raps But then I listen back, I heard a pinch of sass Tender ass Teddy come around, he gon' get pinned to grass I come around with every inch of the mag I'm a wordsmith forreal, you thought Quentin was bad You made me proud, lad, but it seems my child mad With all the clout that he grabbed, it's still doubts from his dad Look, this ain't promotional, you just emotional No doubt you got Starbucks, with all that Joe in you I part his reign lightnin' fast, just what Joseph do A black cloud all over the 6, check the overview You're so indirect, shit wasn't real clear Either Jimmy actin' or he really miss a wheelchair What he don't know is we the most kindred of souls I should've did this two Kendricks ago He wanna sing  Well let's get into the show, commence my role For Jodeci, Boyz I I Men, we at the end of the road I figure he's that close to his death to know the reaper In fitted sweats with old sneakers, the flow ether Gassed 'cause he K O'd Omeeka, no Joe's deeper Quick to put extension on singer, that's Moesha Nothin' 'bout Rick slick, but show of the Caesar My crust from the same old pizza as Mona Lisa So how you callin' out the lyrical god Your face light up when you see me, talkin' Miracle Watts'Cause your words ain't sayin' a thing I kilogram without weighin' a thing Nigga, you baitin' a king Tell you the way that Golden State say to its team Aubrey, you gotta make a shot, you wanna play on the wingTell me, how long are we supposed to act like this We won't never get on track like this How can I ever tell you how I feel if you react like this You call me over here to talk, and I get attacked like this It's funny Got your track shoes on, but what you running from Shit, I know where you going and where you coming from That’s immaturity showing, it's just the baby in you One of the reasons why I never put a baby in you Tired of hearing how you’ll never trust me again How you love me, then you hate me, then you love me again One minute I’m your soul-mate, then it’s fuck me again Until you get horny enough and wan' fuck me again, but check it I just wan' treat you good and do better You think I’m running round tryna be the hood's Hugh Heffner Say I’m all about hoes when I’m all about you Even when I’m with my hoes, I tell them all about you Say that’s just one reason I keep losing you I don’t understand it, that shit is confusing too You left me, I’m doing me, you doing you So what the fuck is me doing me have to do witchu How dare you tell me it's tougher for you Like I don’t hear about them niggas you fucking with too I'd never knew you thought like that Who knew you was into sports like that More prayers because they all players You out there having a ball, player, ball player after ball player I mean you with the ball players more than ball players Hope they ain't fucking you and making you they ball-player Come to me, I just get a hard time Why they give one to you, is this what you wan' do With me you get an attitude, you get all stuck up Start calling me a fuck up till I tell you shut the fuck up Yeah, but the part I don’t respect is You so cool with every other one of your exes It's history between us, all ain't right either Back and forth domestic, all ain't flights either Be wanting you close to me, supposedly You say you over me, that just comes across as a joke to me'Cause you ain't got the kind of love that expires Worst case, you’ll get tired, tell your friends I'm a liar Tried therapy when we felt it going sour That’s four-hundred dollars every hour For him to come and mediate, referee, be our interpreter Tell me I need to lower my voice, don’t curse at her Says she’s only frustrated 'cause I keep hurtin' her Tell me despite all that, he can tell that I worship her Soon as you let your guard down, I get it up again Fixing it is too much work, so I give up again But I wan' spend the rest of my life with you Make a wife with you, make it alright with you But how are you ever suppose to think that I’m right for you When all I ever do is treat you like a recyclable Disgraceful and you want me to chase you But it's easier for me to replace you, 'cause I see it like If you can't deal with what we go through I got bitches lined up, I got a ego too And to them I’m everything, funny, I'm great and I’m charming But to you I’m alarming, all I do is bring harm in To you, I’m the cause of all your misery Of course I disagree, you going off our history All that arguing just ain't my style'Cause that anger now got us like strangers now You tell me I should get help and I’m sick in the head You found makeup on the sheets, I had a bitch in our bed But wait, I ain't love her though, I ain't fuck her though I could dead that bitch right now man, fuck that hoe You just think I'll get another and another hoe Way you talk to me it's like I got a whole club of hoes But I could switch gears, make 'em all disappear You going through my phone like I got a bitch in there We discussing chicks after they through They don’t matter to me, but for some reason they matter to you We keep having the same threesome But not the kind that come as a blessing, nah You keep bringing up my last girl like she ain't my past girl Like you ain't the reason she present, check it You ain't gotta worry about me and her If I wanted to be with her I would be with her Yeah, we hung together, strip clubs, had fun together But that’s done, don't sweat her, uh You the only one I wanna do a bid with Live with, share my last name, have kids with Can't be understated, anytime we ever dated You compare me in your head to some nigga you created I’m a long way from perfect, I got shit with me Still I want you to love me unconditionally Nine-years in, I don’t deserve what you giving me Like you get a victory by acting like a dick to me Want me to see how it feels, I get the trickery Lesson learned though, you my missing piece Give another chance to your ex You don’t pick up the phone, you don’t answer my texts Bitch, we ain't give it all that we got Still ain't empty the clip, let's give it one more shot Or we can go ahead on our own I need you, I can’t do this aloneMy path for tomorrow is relaxing at full throttle Born to be a leader but a tough act to follow Bet on me at all costs in spite of my cash So if I can’t afford the Waldorf, I can afford to fall off Stories over greatness, no stopping my zone I’m bumping "Roman’s Revenge," but I’m plotting my own Like a prophecy in case niggas haven’t learned not to bother me'Fore you send your shots, just check my return policy Could do without the leeches, shoes without the creases Miami Heat hater but I do the South Beaches For any drama I be calling up monsters I ain't Gilbert I never met a Wall I can’t conquer Ruger aimed if I’m who you try and belittle I learned it’s hard to get justice when you try and be civil Whatever the future holds I can live with the day Some niggas will sell their soul but some will give it away And that’s the devil in disguise they window of opportunity is minimized Simplified, check what I exemplify Bitch nigga, here’s something for you to generalize Estate out by Tenafly, pool houses, winterized Play in that water, you bound to get your feet wet Only rapper with nuttin' to hide, me and G-Dep My shorty might disagree with that sentiment If I keep something from you, I promise it’s all innocent Bitches gon get you with that fake out beat I won’t let them Media Takeout me, a made nigga Gotta know when dealing with me you gon' put up with a lot of hate Before you say you love me, how much of it can you tolerate You can’t talk about marriage and giving birth If you hit the dirt anytime you think I lift a skirt It grows tiresome every time you get berserk Plus if you abandon home over what was just a flirt Without a care, I just chuck deuces My skin'll turn numb and you’ll be stuck with what your truth is Then you’ll feel a way, thinking I should have resisted Then you’ll start to see a side of me you never knew existed'Cause you never seen me act like a jerk I know women will provoke you and get mad when it works Rather reserved, and that always makes matters the worst'Cause I go on about my business and not act like it hurts But wait, it’s to the point I gotta ask myself Why the fuck is it so easy to detach myself Maybe it ain't you, just something I lack myself But if these wounds are self inflicted I can patch myself Now listen, I could give a fuck bout how them other niggas treated you If your ass was that perfect they would be with you I don’t care if you dime’d out You’ll say you're the best I’ll ever have and I’ll say I’m willing to find out Wait, I’m thinking bout our bond and what happened to it If you ain't lifting the burden, you probably adding to it She say my logic’s wild and it’s sick to her She say I’m all for self and don’t consider her She feel like she don’t have a voice in this relationship I’m thinking boo you got a choice so why you taking it Certain shit I wouldn’t stand for I’m giving her my all but she demands more I wish she would understand more Certain shit you couldn’t plan for I’m guessing if I love you and you're worth it I should take some time out and figure if you deserve this But you just think that I’m full of it We both come from backgrounds of bullshit I’m fortunate that ain't what you see in me I’ll stop lying to you once you start believing me……Ugh, shorty old news though Yesterday's paper Check this!Baby like it raw, I don't even waste a Magnum on her Clean up amazing, I appreciate the fashion on her Badder than a motherfuck, ain't too many passin' on her Only right I pick her up, the way she got a wagon on her When I'm on that road, don't forget the bops when I'm in town Not unless it's for the threesome, if it's poppin' she'll be down Know these other jokers be starin', but it stop when I'm around Just to get inside them jeans she be hoppin' up and down Let the world know that she ride They think that eventually we'll break up And I love it when we argue, ‘cause eventually we make up I mean, we fight and fuck, we fuck and fight We fuck some more, every fuckin' night Shape great, taste great, body softer than Cashmere Anytime her cheques drop she knows she can crash here Them other broads is other broads, all of them is last year Can't get mad, I'm just stating facts here, word She don't put it down-down like you Down-down like you, down-down like you She don’t put it down like you Down-down like you, down-down like you She don’t put it down like you Girl, you working with the killer Ain’t nobody fuckin' with ya She don’t put it down like you Down-down like you, down-down like you She don’t put it down like youShe ain’t got a leg to stand on Don’t even trip I can take you all over the world though Even tell you pack light The last slide couldn’t even get a cab ride She don’t do the blogs, but if she did, she’d be on mad sites Ass so mean that I’m always on her bad side Uh, now she don’t ever stress me ’bout my whereabouts Never seems concerned With other birds that she may hear about She mind hers, since mine's hers That shit she barely care about Look amazing on me, why I’m always tryna wear her out She don’t ride like you, no, she don’t taste like that Not with a waist like that, do I let her go to waste like that She a mix between Kama Sutra, yoga and porno flicks Funny how her breath get shorter when I give her long dick Uh, and I’m telling y’all straight up Might think I imagined shorty even when she not made-up She kill ‘em in Levi’s, see why  It ain’t even fair Look good in whatever she wear How could other women compare  They can’tI give you my all But it seems like that's not enough Lettin' you get more of me So while the world keep on changin'The one thing remainin'Is I keep lettin' you get more of me My story, my pain, can't ail it My tears overflowed, you can't pale it My talent too immense, can't jail it Niggas tried to cross the God, but they ain't nail it My path, my walkway, you can't trail it My ladder, my mountain, can't scale it It's my life, my struggles, can't help it I'm just grateful that He kept me alive for me to tell it Check it, see the music industry changed me It was everything that I'd have never guessed it was So my discography is all full of hand-me-downs I couldn't figure out another way to dress it up So every verse spiked with the truth Nah, no one know me better than this mic and this booth It's no better way, I owe my today to my yesterdays You live with regrets, probably die with 'em too So I trust God more than myself, I'm tryna tell ya Was drunk in the basement, now I'm in the wine cellar I learned to never let the fear settle in And now I'm more prepared than I've ever been Not one ounce of hate in my glans Just one of the things O G taught me way in advance Said it's two types of folk in this world Got the ones that's out doin' it, and those busy sayin' they can'tNew Joe Budden!Good afternoon everyone  I'm Kenny Powers  If you're here and you're someone Shane cared about, or someone Shane loved  Or maybe you're just somebody who has no business being here at all who's just here because you think it's gonna make you more popular  You know, Shane and I used to fuck around big time  We fuckin' partied hard  We'd ride our vehicles around  Slay ass My condolences, my condolences Whole family in mourning send my condolences My condolences, crazy I just spoke to him Courtney dropping drinks all in Hooters She losin' focus shit Don't send a text, I don't care y'all mad Shit, I waited 5 days nigga where y'all at For real, I'm calling Stunna Cause all Summer 16, ain't heard a hot 16 'bout all Summer Awareness is high, say attention I'm seeking Since I'm reaching, it's offensive they're convinced I'm a demon Such a thin disagreement, son my kin for a reason Killing you is expected of me, I don't win an achievement Somebody pinch me I'm dreaming, take this mental reprievement Since I know the nigga, I know this ain't the man that I'm seein'I heard it straight from the 'Bama's mouth, he won't pull a hammer out Wasn't you at Hov's show scared to pull the camera out I'm seeing habits switch, magic tricks You froggy behind that Apple fix The passiveness in your manner I might react to it Automatic shit Ratchet kids at your crib that can't even spell Calabasas bitch So I take all the guns, load half the clips I just notice you run, we mention half the Clipse I'll save that for another time I'll get back to it I'm kinda shocked to look at what we've advanced to Knew it'd get you dismantled, knew the issues I ran through Sick of the scandal, or maybe I just misunderstand you I kept it a buck, thought that, that was shit you could handle You said that you wondered if anything you doin' was brand new, right I got him, no one help, father punch below the belt Introspection means dig deep, let's look below the wealth I wanna know myself How you tell bitches know they self When you don't even know yourself You wouldn't know yourself Say he Canadian, maybe Asian, Croatian Be sounding like his Jamaican friends, depend on what state he in I think you rap good, but you a movie star So that owl's appropriate, we don't know who you are Where did the boy's brain change  Was it the club scene Now you sound like you use people and love things But later for how you use people and love things The entendres that upswing when I call you drug king That record contract, leaves a lot to exam Never dealt drugs in his life, but sold a lotta gram That's too much baking soda, good thing my break is over They thinking cause my paper lower, this for Rage to blow up Or maybe they just woke up You leverage your celeb, taking waves over That's territorial takeover Maybe he thinks nobody notices Gucci wasn't home two seconds before you rode his dick Bodied Versace flows, copy, that he stole Ay dios mio, sorry Migos, adios amigo Was that your plot all along Why you ain't do that vid with Fetty but you hopped on the song No really, we want a Party album But you keep stealing all of Party's album To go and put it on your party album It's plenty reason to slay you Kept going up Tuesday's and now The Weeknd just hates you Are you lifeless  Sound like a zombie on the track Remember "Started From the Bottom," it was Zombie on the Track Know who else started from the bottom  Zombie on the Track How come after that joint I don't see Zombie on a track I'm from Jersey, so Zombie I got your back Be alarmed the real is finally back Get your guard up now, hope your heart up now Battery in him, let's see if he get charged up now I'm wake I'm wake We at the wakeWhat am I afraid of This is supposed to be what dreams are made of But people I don't have the time to hang with Always look at me and say the same shit They say you promised you would never change I just feel like you broke a promise to me Only hurt cause I thought you were being honest with me So I’m gon' try and do this honorably Without the sponsoring fee what’s most alarming to me This so emotional for you, robust such the calm in me,Easy to put off notes in thugs harmony Speak to his insecurity, acting so irresponsibly And it's further impacted by the fact that you respond to me See some of us know you as Jimmy barely old He had the baby belly fro, nigga was frail up in his clothes Barely got a hold and it’s seeming very outta control Wish we could go back and grab the blackberry with the scroll, oh Yeah Aubrey that’s the one we trusted Not this new Aubrey with his stomach sculpted I'm disgusted, you're such a fuckin' incumbent Can't govern, trust in the public becoming a fucking puppet It’s bigger than rap battles, a word for the digital cash castle Don’t let a glitch in the Mac crash you Unrelaxed wearing political straps tackled Now clash paths with dad, the original bad apple I know where you at, shit I was there too When shit was happening fast, word, I got scared too Impossible feats, impossible to sleep Making promises impossible to keep likeSome of y'all already know what time it is, though What up What up  It's for hip-hop House Gang,

as it played I heard him say I wasn't mentioned with y'all Joell started it, only right I finish the job So all that shit is revocable, from an overview Only thing noticeable is how he barely gave me any quotables I state facts, not to say it's wack but check the playback Outrhyming A$A P ain't showing me where your weight at I'm on my shit today, you the king of New York You might as well had spit on Biggie's grave, couldn't let that slip away I'm in the court of public opinion, ready to click and spray Light Jay Elec ass up, that's my Exhibit A Bitch kill my vibe is what you wanna get into Drown em all in a swimming pool, full of phlegm and drool You renting jewels what's with all the fascination So when I ask you 'bout it that's my cross examination This a scrimmage to me, all these blemished M C's Infamously it's about image I see But if it's bars, not about bread, to hell with the wealth Put you inside of the bullet just to see a shell of yourself I mean, uh, since rap has been accessible They actions been regrettable, this is what the net'll do Chick sending message to tricks ain't get to see 'em They ain't even artists and they get paid per diem We talking bars, then this whole conversation changed Fuck all the subliminals, now nigga saying names Some of these O G's I laugh at, y'all don't know me to half ass To me it's just one Joey that's bad ass King of
