frightful sight Of people running, child And they sang, la la la la...When I sat down beside the lamp I couldn't believe my eyes They were blowing a bubble pipe About two times the size As they sang, la la la la...It's fun just to be Be what you are So we are singing this song It's fun just to be Be what you are So we are singing A happy songSeventy-three men sailed up from the San Francisco Bay
