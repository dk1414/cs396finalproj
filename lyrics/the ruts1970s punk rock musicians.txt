The room gets dark when the music gets loud The treble cuts through when the rythmn takes the bite But there's no room to move 'cause the floor is packed tight A voice shouts loud, "We'll never surrender!"A voice in the crowd, "We'll never surrender!"A head in the cloud, blind propaganda Never surrender, we'll never surrender The skins in the corner are staring at the bar The rude boys are dancing to some heavy heavy ska It's getting so hot, people are dripping with sweat The punks in the corner are speeding like a jet Staring at the rude boys Staring at the rude boys Dancing with the rude boys Dancing with the rude boys Staring at the rude boys Staring at the rude boys A bunch of B M's march in on D M's And some standing there saluting the air They wanna be pirates but the sea is not calm Tattooed crossbones on their armsThe air was thick with a smell of oppression The militants joined with angry position The tension tight with the strain of repression Young blood boiling hot with agression Jah war fighting fighting Jah war, too close frightening The winds were blowing and stirring up reaction A storm broke out a militant action Hot heads came in uniform Thunder and lightning in a violent form Jah war fighting fighting Jah war, too close frightening Solo Jah war fighting fighting Jah war, too close frightening The air etc Jah war fighting fighting Jah war, too close frighteningI can’t concentrate, I’m in a state I don’t feel straight, I can’t love or hate I can't feel nothing, can’t feel no sting Only just learning, I ain’t a king If you're in a rut You
