cassette tape Now keep in mind I was a fan, but as M C's we all are And very few of us become stars Went from blastin' Magic Mike to grabbin' a mic Tried to sound like Spice 1 and not Rapper's Delight E-40 to Ice Cube The west coast had a lot to do with the type of beats I'd write to But still the Juice Crew was one of my faves Never discriminated, whether New York or L AAnd around the mid '90s I became fascinated with the Lord Finesse style of slick rhymin'The Redmans, the Big L's, the Das E FX's Ras Kass and Chino X L type of records Celph Titled emerged Bowling ball style, runnin' through pens, author of murderous words And I was set to rip every verse I put down17 years old and at rappin' I'm pretty good nowThe sound of my voice'll make stab wounds Barber of the universe leavin'
