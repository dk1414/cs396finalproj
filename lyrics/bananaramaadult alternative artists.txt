Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning, I sit around Trying to smile, but the air is so heavy and dry Strange voices are saying Things I can't understand It's too close for comfort, this heat has got right out of hand It's a cruel , cruel summer Leaving me here on my own It's a cruel , cruel summer Now you're gone The city is crowded, my friends are away and I'm on my own It's too hot to handle so I got to get up and go It's a cruel , cruel summer Leaving me here on my own It's a cruel , cruel summer Now you're gone You're not the only oneGoddess on the mountain top Burning like a silver flame The summit of beauty and love And Venus was her name She's got it Yeah, baby, she's got it I'm your Venus, I'm your fire At your desire Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire At your desire Her weapons were her crystal eyes Making every man mad Black as the dark night she was Got what no one else had Wow!She's got it Yeah, baby, she's got it I'm your Venus, I'm your fire At your desire Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire At your desireHopes dashed to the floor Like shattered teenage dreams Boys living next door Are never what they seem ooooh A walk in the park can become a bad dream People are staring and following me This is my only escape from it all Watching a film or a face on the wall Robert De Niro's waiting Talking Italian Robert De Niro's waiting Talking Italian Robert De Niro's waiting Talking Italian Robert De Niro's waiting I don't need a boy I've got a man of steel Don't come any closer I don't wanna feel, ooh Your breathing, your touching But nothing's for free I never want this to happen to me Don't try to change me you're wasting your time Now I've got something much better in mindLast night I was dreaming I was locked in a prison cell When I woke up I was screaming Calling out your name And the judge and the jury They all put the blame on me They wanna tell from my story They want to hear my plea Only you can set me free'Cause I'm guilty Guilty as a girl can be Come on baby, can't you see I stand accused Of love in the first degree Of love in the first degree Someday I'm believing You will come to my rescue Unchain my heart, you'll keep him Let me start a new The hours passed so slowly Since they've thrown away the key Can't you see that I'm lonely Won't you help me pleaseWho needs friends who never show I'll tell you what you want to know I could have saved a broken heart If I'd found out long ago I'm just thinking about Those lonely nights When I waited for your call'Til I found out All my friends were right I didn't know you at all I heard a rumour Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour They say you got a broken heart I heard it I heard a rumour Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour Yes I did, boy ooh, ooh, ooh Now it seems they're telling me You've changed your wicked ways But should I give you a second chance Baby, I'm too afraidThe room has suddenly grown cold And outside in the street it's raining You packed your bags and said goodbye You took my heart without explaining How could you go How could you go We had a love most people never know Ooh stop before you break my heart I want you back, don't care what I have to do I want you back back back I want you back, gotta get it through to you I want you back back back If I can make you see Only you can fill the need in me If you walk away You'll regret it some day Please stay This room is full of memories and Shadows of the past remind me Of all the love I gave in vain and All the hurt I feel inside meI never meant to hurt you Didn't mean to do you wrong I guess I never learned to Cherish love 'til it was gone And then by chance to meet you Bringing back the memories I realised I need you Could you ever come on back to me Baby, baby, baby I know that we can make it Let me love you one more time One more chance to make it right I could make you change your mind Let me love you one more time Didn't know 'til I saw you We've been apart for much too long How my heart still beats for you Oh, my love is growing strong Baby, baby, baby I know that we can make it Let me love you one more time One more chance to make it right I could make you change your mind Let me love you one more timeIt ain't what you do it's the way that you do it It ain't what you do it's the way that you do it It ain't what you do it's the way that you do it And that's what gets results It ain't what you do it's the time that you do it It ain't what you do it's the time that you do it It ain't what you do it's the time that you do it And that's what gets results You can try hard don't mean a thing Take it easy and then your jive will swing It ain't what you do it's the place that you do it It ain't what you do it's the place that you do it It ain't what you do it's the place that you do it And that's what gets results I thought I was smart but I soon found out I didn't know what life was all about But then I learnt I must confess That life is like a game of chess It ain't what you do it's the way that you do it It ain't what you do it's the time that you do it It ain't what you do it's the place that you do it And that's what gets resultsSomewhere in the night, she'll look into your eyes And tell you what you want to hear She'll wrap herself around you like a spider's web When you're least expecting it Play on the strings of your heart, your heart Don't even know who you are 'cause you are Living a masquerade , don't let the stardust fade away'Cause you can be who you want to be Living a masquerade , don't say we're all the same You can be what you want to be, c'est magnifique In the quiet of the night those thoughts return to spite Deluxe and then delightful When you strip it all away, je suis désolé Life is just a mystery I am the queen of hearts, your heart Now show me who you are 'cause you areYou packed your bags as I recall And you walked slowly down the hall You said you had to get away to ease your mind And all you needed was a just little of time Oh winter's passed, spring and fall You never wrote me, you never called Nathan Jones you've been gone too long Gone too long...If a woman could die of tears Nathan Jones, well, I wouldn't be here The key that you're holding won't fit my door And there's no room in my heart for you no more'Cause, winter's passed, spring and fall You never wrote me, you never called Nathan Jones you've been gone too long Gone too long Nathan Jones, Nathan Jones...Nathan Jones, ooh..Winter's passed, spring and fall You never wrote me, you never called Nathan Jones you've been gone too long Gone too long
