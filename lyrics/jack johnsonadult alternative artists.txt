There's no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart Our dreams and they are made out of real things Like a shoebox of photographs with sepia-toned loving Love is the answer, at least for most of the questions in my heart Like why are we here and where do we go, and how come it's so hard It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together Mmm, it's always better when we're together Yeah, we'll look at them stars and we're together Well, it's always better when we're together Yeah, it's always better when we're together And all of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight But I know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings Or brings new things, for tomorrow night, you see That they'll be gone too, too many things I have to do But if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene I'd be under the impression I was somewhere in between With only two, just me and you, not so many things we got to do Or places we got to be, we'll sit beneath the mango tree nowWell, can't you see that it's just raining There ain't no need to go outside But baby you hardly even notice When I try to show you this Song, it's meant to keep you From doing what you're supposed to Like waking up too early Maybe we could sleep in Make you banana pancakes Pretend like it's the weekend now And we could pretend it all the time Can't you see that it's just raining There ain't no need to go outside But just maybe Hala ka ukulele Mama made a baby Really don't mind the practice'Cause you're my little lady Lady, lady, love me'Cause I love to lay here lazy We could close the curtains Pretend like there's no world outsideWho's to say What's impossible  Well, they forgot This world keeps spinning, and with each new day I can feel a change in everything And as the surface breaks, reflections fade But in some ways, they remain the same And as my mind begins to spread its wings There's no stopping curiosity I wanna turn the whole thing upside down I'll find the things they say just can't be found I'll share this love I find with everyone We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs I don't want this feeling to go away Who's to say I can't do everything  Well, I can try And as I roll along I begin to find Things aren't always just what they seem I wanna turn the whole thing upside down I'll find the things they say just can't be found I'll share this love I find with everyone We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs This world keeps spinningWell I was sitting, waiting, wishing You believed in superstitions Then maybe you'd see the signs But Lord knows that this world is cruel And I ain't the Lord, no I'm just a fool Learning loving somebody don't make them love you Must I always be waiting, waiting on you Must I always be playing, playing your fool I sang your songs, I danced your dance I gave your friends all a chance But putting up with them wasn't worth never having you Ah, maybe you've been through this before But it's my first time so please ignore The next few lines 'cause they're directed at you I can't always be waiting, waiting on you I can't always be playing, playing your fool I keep playing your part But it's not my scene Want this plot to twist I've had enough mystery Keep building it up But then you're shooting me down But I'm already downI know she said it's alright But you can make it up next time I know she knows it's not right There ain't no use in lying Maybe she thinks I know something Maybe, maybe she thinks it's fine Or maybe she knows something I don't I'm so, I'm so tired, I'm so tired of trying It seems to me that maybe It pretty much always means no So don't tell me you might just let it go And often times we're lazy It seems to stand in my way Because no one, no, nah, no one likes to be let down I know she loves the sunrise No longer sees it with her sleeping eyes And I know that when she said she's going to try Well it might not work because of other ties and I know she usually has some other ties and I wouldn't want to break 'em, nah, I wouldn't want to break 'em Maybe she'll help me to untie this but Until then, well, I'm going to have to lie tooThere's no combination of words I could put on the
