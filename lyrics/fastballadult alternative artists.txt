They made up their minds and they started packing And left before the sun came up that day An exit to eternal summer slacking But where were they going without ever knowing the way They drank up the wine and they got to talking But now had more important things to say And when the car broke down, they started walking Where were they going without ever knowing the way Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold And it's always summer, they'll never get cold They'll never get hungry They'll never get old and grey You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere They won't make it home, but they really don't care They wanted the highway They're happier there today, today The children woke up, and they couldn't find them They left before the sun came up that day They just drove off and left it all behind 'em Where were they going without ever knowing the way Sometimes I feel like I am drunk behind the wheel The wheel of possibility, however it may roll Give it a spin, see if you can somehow factor in You know there's always more than one way To say exactly what you mean to say Was I out of my head  Was I out of my mind How could I have ever been so blind I was waiting for an indication It was hard to find Don't matter what I say, only what I do I never mean to do bad things to you So quiet, but I finally woke up If you're sad, then it's time you spoke up, too Was I out of my head  Was I out of my mind How could I have ever been so blind I was waiting for an indication It was hard to find Don't matter what I say, only what I do I never mean to do bad things to you So quiet, but I finally woke up If you're sad, then it's time you spoke up, too Was I out of my head  Was I out of my mind How could I have ever been so blind I was waiting for an invitation It was hard to find Don't matter what I say, only what I do I never mean to do bad things to you So quiet, but I finally woke up If you're sad, then it's time you spoke up...tooCan you make

Living to get his freak on Sporting his leopard skin thong Charlie, the methadone man Plays sunday nights in a rock and roll band Charlie, the methadone, the methadone man Patience, the name of the game Waiting on Doctor Kincaid Charlie, the methadone man Fills out the papers just as fast as he can Charlie, the methadone, the methadone man When you're all alone And you've got no where to go Better take it slow'Till you get so tired of where you are Kicking his lonely lit brain Drinking to try and stay sane Charlie, the methadone man Chases his tail just as fast as he can Charlie, the methadone, the methadone manI was wondering how you're feeling I thought I saw you kneeling And holding your gut last night It looked like you were praying But I heard someone saying You had been in an awful fight You get the worst of it everytime Lashing out with no reason or rhyme To loose all this rage at so tender an age Little baby growing up in a rat cage Are you ready for the fallout Who you gonna call out When does it finally come to blows I think that you're forgetting The blood that you'll be letting Has a price on it, no one knows You may be suffering in your sleep You may be getting in way too deep And you may not care for advice that I share In one ear and out the other Soon you will learn how to swallow a tear So when you're old you can cry in your beer Do you spit at the face staring back in the mirror Do you have any self respect She, she belongs to me But she doesn't know it, oh yah She comes walking down the street She don't notice me She comes 'round She knows how She turns me inside out, upside down I'm twisted metal tongue When I get around you, unless Stutter incomplete I can't keep the beat She comes 'round She knows how She turns me inside out, inside out, upside down She comes 'round My guard is down She gets me everytime She don't even notice me When she goes 'round and 'round
