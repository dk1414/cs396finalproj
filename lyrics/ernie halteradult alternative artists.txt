How do I ask her to come back to me After I told her goodbye How do I love her so desperetly For so long I pushed her aside How do I walk back into her life When I'm the one who walked out on her How do I ask her to see me again I told her that I wasn't sure That we could be friends God can you whisper in her ear Anywhere on the way to her car Before the wind blows her too far Away from my heart, yeah Ooh, can you whisper, ooh, in her ear Anytime while she's laying on her bed Can you tell her everything that I've said Everything that I've said, ooh How do I try and explain everything When nothing I say seems to fit How do I get her to pick up the phone How did we ever get like this What kind of man lets love slips away And leave such a good thing behind I'm holding my hands pressed praying to find A way to fill in this hole that I have insideThere's a stain on my notebook Where your coffee cup was And there's ash in the pages Now I've got myself lost I was writing to tell you That my feelings tonight Are a stain on my notebook That rings your goodbye Oh, now she's gone And I'm back on the beat A stain on my notebook Says nothing to me Oh, now she's gone And I'm out with a friend With lips full of passion And coffee in bed Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh With the way that you left me I can hardly contain The hurt and the anger The joy and the painShe moves her body like a cyclone She make me wanna to do it all night long Goin' hard when they turn the spotlights on Moves her body like a cyclone She moves her body like a cyclone She make me wanna to do it all night long Goin' hard when they turn the spotlights on Moves her body like a cyclone Now look at that peppa'On the back of that bumpa'She didn't even playin'When she's shakin' that ruppa'You don't know She gets lower than a muffla'With her girlfriends Show stopping with a hustla'The way she move her body She may see the Maserati Wanna put it on me Show me the Tsunami Make it hard to copy Tight and never sloppy She got an entourage And her own paparazziUhhhhh Wise men say, only fools rush in But I can't help, falling in love with you Shall I stay  Would it be a sin If I can't help, falling

sidewalks busy sidewalks Dressed in holiday style In the air There's a feeling Of Christmas Children laughing People passing Meeting smile after smile And on ev'ry street corner you'll hear Silver bells silver bells It's Christmas time in the city Ring a ling hear them sing Soon it will be Christmas day Strings of street lights Even stop lights Blink a bright red and green As the shoppers rush Home with their treasures Hear the snow crunch See the kids bunch This is Santa's big scene And above all this bustle You'll hear Silver bells, silver bells It's Christmas time in the city Ring-a-ling, hear them sing Soon it will be Christmas dayLove, It's not what we thought it'd be The lives we thought we'd lead are gone and we're alone Ohhh woah Love, it took all our pictures down Now I'm faced with the empty sound of you not comin' home Seems like we're better off, we're better off alone..Better off with different lives, better off with different lives Its time to move one Its nobody's fault You know we're better off with different lives Love, it never got easier Now I can't breathe, when we're together anymore Ohhh Woah Love, thought we could reconcile Oh but the differences that we hide are that we can;t ignore It seems that we're better off, we're better off alone Better off with different lives Better off with different lives Its time to move on It's nobody's fault You know we're better off with different lives So I gave you back the key Cause I can't unlock this door And I told you everything Took our lives up off the floor Now I'm finally sure Better off with different lives Better off with different lives Time to move on It's nobody's fault You know we're better off with different livesCan you believe it's already been seven years And it feels like yesterday I can recall what the right girl at the wrong time looked like She was a waitress in the place where they knew me well And they called me by my name I was a guy with time that someone like her might like Wasn't perfect but we knew we had to do it anyway'Cause it's hard to let a good love go We tried to find some open road But what we found is you never can tell And it all just goes to show It's hard to let a good love go Hard to let a good love go I'll never forget how it seemed when she had to leave And it was out of her hands All of the plans that we made and the words that never got said But there is no doubt that I have every reason to be angry and confused You never can tell what the hell kind of hand life's gonna deal you Tried to move on but it turns out it was tougher than it seems'Cause it's hard to let a good love go We tried to find some open road But what we found is you never can tell And it all just goes to show It's hard to let a good love go I thought that I was over you 'til that call came through And it turned me upside down I told you I had found someone I was happy now And I wanna believe that it's true But it's hard to let a good love go We tried and traveled down that road But we found 'cause you never can tell And it all just goes to show Yeah, it all just goes to show Well, it all just goes to show It's hard to let a good love go Hard to let a good love go Went out last Friday night Felt like I was ready to Pretty pair of green eyes Sideways glance from across the room Pretty soon we were locked in conversation I could have kissed her leaning up against the driver door She was almost everything that I've been looking for She was almost you Almost you Almost someone to hold on to Almost you A love to last my whole life Just when I think I've found it, the perfect love, she lets me down The best someone else could hope to do Is take second place and be almost you You Stumble on an old photograph You and me, we were holdin' hands We were young and so in love Like we couldn't get close enough What happened to happily ever after I never look at anyone the way I looked at you I'm tryin' hard to find somebody new She was almost you Almost you Almost someone to hold on to Almost you A love to last my whole life Just when I think I've found it, the perfect love, she lets me down The best someone else could hope to do Is take second place and be almost you Almost you I never look at anyone the way I looked at you I'm tryin' hard to find somebody new She was almost you Almost you Almost someone to hold on to Almost you A love to last my whole life Just when I think I've found it, the perfect love, she lets me down The best someone else could hope to do Is take second place and be almost you Almost you
