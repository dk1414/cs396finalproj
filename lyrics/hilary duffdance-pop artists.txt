Hey now, hey now Hey now, hey now Have you ever seen such a beautiful night I could almost kiss the stars for shining so bright When I see you smiling I go, "Oh, oh, oh"I would never want to miss this'Cause in my heart, I know what this is Hey now, hey now This is what dreams are made of Hey now, hey now This is what dreams are made of I've got somewhere I belong I've got somebody to love This is what dreams are made of This is what dreams are made of Have you ever wondered what life is about You could search the world and never figure it out You don't have to sail the oceans No, no, no Happiness is no mystery It's here and now It's you and me, yeahLet's go back, back to the beginning Back to when the Earth, the Sun, the stars all aligned'Cause perfect didn't feel so perfect Trying to fit a square into a circle was no life I defy Let the rain fall down and wake my dreams Let it wash away my sanity'Cause I wanna feel the thunder, I wanna scream Let the rain fall down I'm coming clean I'm coming clean, oh I'm shedding, shedding every color Tryna find a pigment of truth beneath my skin, oh'Cause different doesn't feel so different And going out is better than always staying in Feel the wind Let the rain fall down and wake my dreams Let it wash away my sanity'Cause I wanna feel the thunder, I wanna scream Let the rain fall down I'm coming clean I'm coming clean So yesterday So yesterday, so yesterday You can change your life You can change your clothes If you change your mind Well, that's the way it goes But I'm gonna keep your jeans And your old black hat They look good on me You're never gonna get them back At least not today Not today, not today, 'cause...If it's over, let it go and Come tomorrow, it will seem So yesterday, so yesterday I'm just a bird that's already flown away Laugh it off, let it go and When you wake up, it will seem So yesterday, so yesterday Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be okay Who's got the heart of a hunter Pounding like thunder Prowling the night Hot like an Indian summer Beat of a drummer Coming alive If you got game, boy, you can pass go We can go fast or we can go slow We can get high or we can get low But there ain't no rules tonight If you got young blood, live to party Red-hot, feeling naughty Get loose, go grab somebody If you got young blood, this is our time Hands up, touch the skyline Tonight, yeah, I'ma get mine If you got young blood, blood, blood, blood Young blood, blood, blood young blood, blood, blood, blood Young blood, blood, blood, blood I can't hear a single word Just know you're talking, 'cause your lips keep moving Everything I thought I learned goes out the window All I want is one thing You can promise castles, treasures, babies, I don't care'Cause for now, you're just enough for me, I want you near Like a fairytale to feel your breath right on my neck You remember what I love, so baby, take me back Turn the lights down low and kiss me in the dark'Cause when you're touching me, baby, I see sparks You make my heart go You, you, you make my heart go You, you, you make my heart go Ticking-tocking, like a bomb Throws me back to when I had you closer Skin to skin, we get it on Without the love, I feel you going bolder You can promise castles, treasures, babies, I don't care'Cause for now, you're just enough for me, I want you near Like a fairytale to feel your breath right on my neck You remember what I love, so baby, take me backMmm, yeah you burned me again Well, I don't wanna know where you've been Mmm, how is your new best friend Do you know I will treat you like them And I know...You're under my skin Running in my bloodstream These scars are the way that you loved me I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin Running in my bloodstream These scars are the way that you loved me I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me A tattoo to remind me A tattoo to remind me Apologies for the way I've been I couldn't wash you off my skin No I, I couldn't live without you Mmm, tears and eyes can dry But I know I'm burning like the wire in light bulbs It could be in the way you bleed me And I knowYou act like you don't know me When you see me on the street You're actin' like I turn you off When I know you think I'm sweet It don't have to be like that I guess you're insecure If you say what's on your mind I might answer, "Sure"So I walk a little slower And I try to catch your eye Sometimes it's so hard to see The good things passing by There may never be a sign No flashing neon light Telling you to make your move Or when the time is right why not  take a crazy chance Why not  do a crazy dance If you lose the moment, you might lose a lot So, why not Why not Moment of clarity You're leading me where I'll follow In all my insanity You're real, for now So I keep telling me You take the weight off my shoulders You're every missing piece You're real, for now I let my walls come down And I will let you waste my time I don't care if it's all a lie I'm with you for the night You're taking me, taking me high You're loving me, loving me right Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my kind And so for now Don't want you, don't want you to stop I promise, I won't get enough Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my kind Oh woah, think you're one of my kind You're one of my, one of my Oh woah, think you're one of my kind You're one of my, one of myI remember what I wore on our first date I remember how you felt against my face I remember all the songs we used to hate I remember we were sleepless in New York I remember how my avenues were yours I remember when they weren't anymore No more rain or shine Well, I guess this is goodbye, I I made a top ten list of all the things I missed Your lying eyes and lips, they didn't make it And when I'm cold at night, I know that I'll survive Until I feel alright, I'm gonna fake it Breathe in, breathe out Breathe in, breathe out Breathe in, breathe out Breathe in, breathe out Breathe in, breathe out Breathe in, breathe outIn a moment, everything can change Feel the wind on your shoulder For a minute, all the world can wait Let go of your yesterday Can you hear it calling Can you feel it in your soul Can you trust this longing, and take control Fly Open up the part of you that wants to hide away You can shine Forget about the reasons why you can't in life, and start to try'Cause it's your time, time to fly All your worries, leave them somewhere else Find a dream you can follow Reach for something when there's nothing left And the world's feeling hollow Can you hear it calling Can you feel it in your soul Can you trust this longing, and take control
