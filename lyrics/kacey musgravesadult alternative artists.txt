When it rains, it pours But you didn't even notice It ain't rainin' anymore It's hard to breathe when all you know is The struggle of stayin' above the risin' water line Well, the sky has finally opened The rain and wind stopped blowin'But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again You hold tight to your umbrella Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya That there's always been a rainbow Hangin' over your head If you could see what I see You'd be blinded by the colors Yellow, red, and orange, and green And at least a million others So tie up the boat, take off your coat And take a look around'Cause the sky has finally opened The rain and wind stopped blowin'But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again You hold tight to your umbrella Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya That there's always been a rainbow Hangin' over your headI was just coastin', never really goin' anywhere Caught up in a web, I was gettin' kinda used to stayin' there And out of the blue, I fell for you Now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied I didn't know him and I didn't know me Cloud Nine was always out of reach Now, I remember what it feels like to fly You give me butterflies Kiss full of color makes me wonder where you've always been I was hiding in doubt 'til you brought me out of my chrysalis And I came out new All because of you And now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied I didn't know him and I didn't know me Cloud Nine was always out of reach Now, I remember what it feels like to fly You give me butterflies, yeah You give me butterflies Ooh, mmm, mmmBorn in a hurry, always late Haven't been early since '88 Texas is hot, I can be cold Grandma cried when I pierced my nose Good in a glass, good on green Good when you're putting your hands all over me I'm alright with a slow burn Taking my time, let the world turn I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright If we burn it down and it takes all night It's a slow burn, yeah In Tennessee, the sun's goin' down But in Beijing, they're heading out to work You know the bar down the street don't close for an hour We should take a walk and look at all the flowers'Cause I'm alright with a slow burn Taking my time, let the world turn I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright If we burn it down and it takes all night It's a slow burnYou look out the window while I look at you Saying I don't know would be like saying that the sky ain't blue And boots weren't made for sitting by the door Since you don't wanna stay anymore You can have your space, cowboy I ain't gonna fence you in Go on, ride away in your Silverado Guess I'll see you 'round again I know my place, and it ain't with you Well sunsets fade, and love does, too Yeah, we had our day in the sun When a horse wants to run, there ain't no sense in closing the gate You can have your space, cowboy After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away But roads weren't made to not go down And there ain't room for both of us in this town So you can have your space, cowboy I ain't gonna fence you in Go on, ride away in your Silverado I'll see you around again'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you Sunsets fade, and love does, too We had our day in the sun When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate So you can have your spaceAll that I know Is you caught me at the right time Keep me in your glow'Cause I'm having such a good time With you Baby, don't you know That you're my golden hour The color of my sky You've set

on, didn't think of you We lost touch with each other Fall came and I had to move Movin' backwards, hurt comes after Healin' doesn't happen in a straight line If I cry just a little and then laugh in the middle If I hate you and I love you, and then I change my mind If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact That you shoulda treated me right Then I'm more than just a little justified Mm, mm I'm more than just a little justified To touch somebody You know I tried to make that you And when you lied, said you didn't want me Tell me, what was I supposed to do Movin' onwards, feelin' strong, but Healin' doesn't happen in a straight lineOh, I bet you think you're John Wayne Showing up and shooting down everybody You're classic in the wrong way And we all know the end of the story'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz Every time they open up their mouth Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else And I think we've seen enough, seen enough To know that you ain't ever gonna come down So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up And ride straight out of this town You and your high horse, mmm-mmm You and your high horse,

party The way that you've got me lit up inside It's the song that they're playin', the words that you're sayin'It's never felt so right And I'm the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous When I'm having the time of my life Is there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight Happy and sad at the same time You got me smiling with tears in my eyes I never felt so high No, I've never been this far off of the ground And they say everything that goes up must come down But I don't wanna come down So is there a way to stop all this thinkin', just keep on drinkin'?'Cause I don't wanna wake up When they're turnin' the lights on and it turns out the joke's on me'Cause it feels so right And I'm the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous When I'm having the time of my life
