Lying in my bed and I'm thinking Who's to say what's good and sacred Stuck in patterns, some are faking Unwritten laws we just can't bring ourselves to ditch Well, karma is a bitch Oh yeah What if I wanna get down, I wanna get dirty To save my boy from constantly flirting What if I wanna be painfully honest Would I be reborn unfairly cause I wanna be an itch Well, karma is a bitch I wanna believe in you The devil in me's loudly protesting That we'll make a mess of things I wanna believe I do I know that I might fall It's not perfect You get what you see That's just me Sitting down, I'm having my coffee Watching people on their way Looking closely at their faces Trying to see who's honest and who's a snitch Well, karma is a bitchWhen I'm walking down the street I call your name Inside my head I go insane Don't you know that it's really making me crazy There were days when I went completely blind No time to think and I lost time Won't believe what's happened to me lately'Cause every day is the same day Different faces with no name Places I've never been before And every day is the same thing Different faces with no name Places I've never been before And I begin to wonder Don't you know that it's really making me crazy And I begin to wonder Won't believe what's happened to me lately'Cause every day is the same day Different faces with no name Places I've never been before And every day is the same thing Different faces with no name Places I've never been beforePut the needle on it Put the needle on it Put the needle on it Put the needle on it Put the needle on it Put the needle on it Put the needle on it Put the needle on it Take the bait, bite the line, I got the place, you got the time I'm lickin' my lips, did I make you blush I let you in, the sweat you're in, the temperature is risin'So hot, I may wanna take my clothes off Come inside, your drippin' desire Let the music make you rise up Dirty hands is what I demand Let the music make you rise up Put the

that It feels so good, makes me feel alive When you touch me like that In and out, up and down on the far inside When I sit by myself I'm day dreaming about the two of us And I think to myself I can't

All I wanna do is touch you All I wanna do, all I wanna do All I wanna do, all I wanna do Take a look inside my heart Tell me what you think you need You may not see the innocent girl That you keep inside your dreamsI'm back for more and I got the cure I know where I'm going for sure What we threw away, we should've saved Come and make my day I said some things that did not ring true And I said some things I did not mean to Now I'm back for more 'Cause I don't wanna lose this feeling That you're giving me every time I need it Ain't lookin' for more I need what you're givin' me more, and more I don't wanna lose this feelin'That you're givin' me every time I need it I ain't lookin' for more I need what you're givin' me, more Why can't we blow Why don't we go with our imperfections We know what we threw away, we should've saved Come and make my dayOur first and last summer together We shared the passion till the end I found a friend I will remember I'll never feel the same again Living the dream I'm breathing in deep Let it go It's good to know, yeah it's good to know that You won't forget about me As long as you live, as long as you live You won't forget about me I promise you this As long you live You won't forget about me As long as you live, as long as you live You won't forget about me I promise you this As long you live I hear the music over and over The memories play on and on I'm living this dream I'm breathing in deep Then I hear you say As you drift away That it's good to know, it's good to know thatI'm not good at being lonely I'm sorry if you saw too much But baby, I got too near I'm open to the slightest touch When I don't have you here What can I do  What can I say How could I make the same mistake Can't give it up, can't let it go Ooh, I gotta make you see, it's you for me'Cause I, I can't sleep at night It just don't feel right'Cause, baby, I'm lonely And I want you here to hold me'Cause I, I can't sleep at night It just don't feel right'Cause, baby, I'm lonely I'm not good at being lonely I know you'll give me one more chance I know I crossed the line I'm guessing it's too much to ask That you give me some timeOooh Oooh Oooh Lonesome light years Tethered tears Pull me near And I will have no fear And in the darkness I fall in love And in your arms I'm safe from harm Your current sets me free Iâ€™m feeling your electricity You are my galaxy A star struck heart beat I'm bound by your gravity You are my galaxy You are my galaxy Powers up And we are one Can you feel the love And the midnight sun Feel no g force Weightless our Web is spun Thy will be doneThere was a time you made me smile Made me feel so good inside I never thought you were doing wrong In my heart you were the only one But as time passed us by You seem to change right before my eyes Red lipstick found on your clothes Just another reason to let you know that It's time to move on I have to leave and there's no better way It's time to move on Don't waste your sweet talk It's time to move on I have to leave and there's no better way It's time to move on There is no reason I should stay with you There is no reason, there is no reason There was a time when it was one-on-one And our love life was so much fun Just a touch from your loving hand Would turn me on and my heart would start to dance Just a little bit of loving that we shared Just a little bit of your heart and romance Just a little bit  will never be enough'Cause I need a man that can give me everlasting love
