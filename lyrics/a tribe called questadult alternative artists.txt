they want us there  All us niggas not going Reputation ain’t glowing, reparations ain’t flowing If you find yourself stuck in a creek, you better start rowing Used to see the T V screen as the place to land my dream in And the car stereo where they would promote the show Optimistic little brother with a hope you know
