Hey, hey, you Tell me how have you been You could have a steam train If you just lay down your tracks You could have an aeroplane flying If you bring your blue sky back All you do is call me I'll be anything you need You could have a big dipper Going up and down, all around the bends You could have a bumper car, bumping This amusement never ends I wanna be your sledgehammer Why don't you call my name Oh, let me be your sledgehammer This will be my testimony Show me 'round your fruit cage'Cause I will be your honey bee Open up your fruit cage Where the fruit is as sweet as can beLove, I get so lost sometimes Days pass and this emptiness fills my heart When I want to run away, I drive off in my car But whichever way I go I come back to the place you are All my instincts, they return The grand façade, so soon will burn Without a noise, without my pride I reach out from the inside In your eyes The light, the heat I am complete I see the doorway To a thousand churches The resolution Of all the fruitless searches Oh, I see the light and the heat Oh, I wanna be that complete I wanna touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes Love, I don't like to see so much pain So much wasted and this moment keeps slipping away I get so tired working so hard for our survival I look to the time with you to keep me awake and aliveClimbing up on Solsbury Hill I could see the city light Wind was blowing, time stood still Eagle flew out of the night He was something to observe Came in close, I heard a voice Standing stretching every nerve I had to listen, had no choice I did not believe the information Just had to trust imagination My heart going boom boom boom"Son," he said"Grab your things, I've come to take you home"Ay, back home To keep in silence I resigned My friends would think I was a nut Turning water into wine Open doors would soon be shut So I went from day to day Though my life was in a rut'Til I thought of what I'd say Which connection I should cutIn this proud land we grew up strong We were wanted all along I was taught to fight, taught to win I never thought I could fail No fight left or so it seems I am a man whose dreams have all deserted I've changed my face, I've changed my name But no one wants you when you lose Don't give up 'cause you have friends Don't give up, you're not beaten yet Don't give up, I know you can make it good Though I saw it all around Never thought that I could be affected Thought that we'd be last to go It is so strange the way things turn Drove the night toward my home The place that I was born, on the lakeside As daylight broke, I saw the earth The trees had burned down to the ground Don't give up, you still have us Don't give up, we don't need much of anything Don't give up, 'cause somewhere there's a place where we belong“A

Biko, Biko, because Biko Oh Biko, Biko, because Biko Yihla moja, yihla moja The man is dead The man is deadI, I wish I could swim Like dolphins, like dolphins can swim Though nothing will keep us

watch it growing The place where I come from is a small town They think so small, they use small words But not me – I'm smarter than that, I worked it out I've been stretching my mouth To let those big words come right out I've had enough, I'm getting out To the city, the big, big city I'll be a big noise with all the big boys So much stuff I will own And I will pray to a big god As I kneel in the big church I'm on my way, I'm making it  I've got to make it show, yeah  So much larger than life I'm going to watch it growing The book of love is long and boring No one can lift the damn thing It's full of charts and facts and figures And instructions for dancing But I I love it when you read to me And you You can read me anything The book of love has music in it In fact that's where music comes from Some of it is just transcendental Some of it is just really dumb But I I love it when you sing to me And you You can sing me anything The book of love is long and boring And written very long ago It's full of flowers and heart-shaped boxes And things we're all too young to knowCover me when I run Cover me through the fire Something knocked me out the trees, now I'm on my knees Cover
