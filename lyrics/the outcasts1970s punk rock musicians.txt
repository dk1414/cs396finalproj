spit They say, “it’s best you don’t try, son It’s better than going home crying”They can’t see the story we’re writing But when they do They better tell the world we’re coming They better tell the world we’re alive They better tell the world we’re coming You better be prepared when we arrive They better tell the world to Step up, step up Who’s gonna stop us now  Step up, step up Who’s gonna stop us now  Step up, step up Who’s gonna stop us now  Step up, step up Who’s gonna stop us now  Whoa, wish I never knew What I fell into Ugh, I never would've come through Whoa, a foot I'd never set Gave what I'd never get How did they end up inside my head Ain't no such thing as love for free Trying's only ever made 'em leave Ain't no such thing as love for free I hear their devils talk Every time they breathe Look around, we're the only ones alive We're thе only ones alive Ask the skеletons that lie here You and me, we're the only ones who bleed We're the only ones who bleed The land of make believe The land of make believe The land of make believe Whoa, wish I could bid adieu To the dirty truth They left too many little clues Whoa, now I recollect What we never said How did I end up inside their net Is this a dream come alive Can't read your lips or your eyes Please tell me that we went back in time'Cause every shade of the blue Makes for a mirror of you But I know you can never see what I do Now, listen as the sun goes down Before this night runs out I have to know what we could be Stay with me now Let's say we rip out every page Let's say our hearts could never break Would the words still bе the same Or would we do it ovеr Let's say we tear the book apart Pages scattered in the dark Would the feelings never change Would we do it over The fire burning it all As we shatter the walls Don't tell me this is how we're supposed to fall But if you just look inside You'd find out where you reside But won't you give me just one honest lie Whoa-oh-oh-oh Whoa-oh-oh-oh
