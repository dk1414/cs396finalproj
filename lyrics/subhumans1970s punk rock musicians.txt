Mickey Mouse is dead Got kicked in the head Cos people got too serious They planned out what they said They couldn't take the fantasy They tried to accept reality Analyzed the laughs Cos pleasure comes in halves The purity of comedy They had to take it seriously Changed the words around Tried to make it look profound The comedian is on stage Pisstaking for a wage The critics think he's great But the laughter turns to hate Mickey Mouse is on T.V And the kids stare at the screen But the pictures are all black and white And the words don't mean a thing Cos Mummy's got no money And Daddy is in jail He couldn't afford the license She couldn't afford the bailNo I don't believe in Jesus Christ My mother died of cancer when I was 5 No I don't believe in religion I was forced to go to church, I wasn't told why No I don't believe in the police force Police brutality isn't a dream No I don't believe in the system cos Nothing it does makes sense to me Don't worry you'll get over it You'll grow up, you'll calm down Another youth, another fashion You'll get over it, you'll calm down You don't really mean what you say You've had too much to drink Don't be so full of hatred It's not as bad as you think No I don't believe in what you say You're just part of what I despise Yes you're part of the fucking system I ain't blind, I can see your lies Cos the system thrives on ignorance What the public don't know, they can't reject In the face of you all I stand defiant The rest of the people, they wanna forgetAll is quiet all is dead The city has melted The sound has penetrated Through our heads The world has ended the gas is gone It killed the people now the mutants live on!So long to the world That's what they said It's 1984 and it's all gone dead It's all gone dead!There is no England Anarchy is right But don't contradict Or try to fight It's always dark, there is no light!And 77 has rose to its height!So long to the world That's what they said It's 1984 and it's all gone dead It's all gone dead Do you believe in the afterlife Termination with a rusty knife Religious wars no reason why What a glorious way to die!In the name of God they left you to die!Religious wars there's no reason why!They left you to die!The ultimate excuse is here Die for a cause, religion is fear!Fear of the threat of something unreal Abdicate the way you really feel!In the name of God they left you to die!Religious wars there's no reason why!They left you to die!In the darkness of death There's no light in your eyes A cross in your grave Your time has arrived Drink, sex, Cigarettes Ford Cortina household pets Bombs  War  Famine  Death An apathetic public couldn't care less The Public watches I TV Reads The Sun drinks cups of tea Two-star family stay content Their lives controlled by parliament Well daddy's lost his job again Because he never had no brain He only lives to watch T VHis life controlled by apathy The Russians seem so far away The government seems to be ok The papers never mention war'cause the people that they cater for have got Drink, sex, Cigarettes Ford Cortina household pets Bombs  War  Famine  Death An apathetic public couldn't care less The things that you never knew were there Or was it that you didn't care The biggest problem face to face An apathetic human raceHere we are in a new age!Wishing we were dead There's a tv in my front room And it's screwing up my head!There's a scanner in the toilet To watch you take a bath!And there's a picture of Hiroshima To make sure you never laugh  And somebody told me"Big Brother's watching you"And somebody else said"You know it's not true"Who do you believe !Well the police have all gone crazy You never had it so bad They take away the dignity That you never really had!They know all about you They even know what you drink And if they thought you were worth it They could sus out what you think And think you crazy Oh my god, it's rainin' again And a 7-year-old anarchist is blowin' up Berlin My Subs L P is still brand-new But what does it matter  There's nothin' I can do Great big hole in my back door And everyone expects a nuclear war I've been on the beer, I think I'm gonna spew But what does it matter  There's nothin' I can do The dust in the road gets in my eyes And the system tells such fuckin' lies Why should I believe what they say is true But what does it matter  There's nothin' I can do, no There's nothing I can do I wouldn't do it for you But you wouldn't do it for me Well, that's the facts, you see My 10-year-old sister is on the pill Ronnie Bigg's got a flat in Brazil Third generation ain't got a clue Why does it matter  Ain't nothin' I can do Nothing I can do Nothing I can do, oh yeahDon't ask the people what the people think They've got no opinions but they still think we stink The great British public, the great majority The safe foundation of our society!But we're the minority and we're ok We're the minority, won't go away We're the minority and we're ok We're the minority, got something to say!We're the minority the ones with the brains Putting the country on a nervous strain They can't stand the truth-the truth never lies The great British public got bricks in their eyes!But we're the minority and we're ok We're the minority, won't go away We're the minority and we're ok We're the minority, got something to fucking say When the people of the country have forgotten how to disagree The national economy is said to be ok The wages that you get, will help you to forget Will you keep your ideologies or throw them all away When the system has you beaten Even now you haven't eaten Bevause you can't afford to eat or drink to keep your brain alive Blame the system for the weather Carry on as ever You go to work at half past eight and come back home at five!You can go blue in the face Talking about the human race How they got to outer space, but it never stopped the wars The whole of this humanity is based on greed and vanity The ones who make decisions are the ones who make the laws!But you're still in this society So what's your main priority Remain in the majority who never really cared Or cultivate the hate to annihilate the state Are you prepared to die for your beliefs or just to dye your hair I put on my clothes They make me look dull I dont think about it I dont think at all I dress high class It makes me look high
