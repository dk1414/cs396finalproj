{Instrumental Intro 00:00-00:29}I like to dream Yes, yes, right between the sound machine On a cloud of sound, I drift in the night Any place it goes is right Goes far, flies near to the stars away from here Well, you don't know what we can find Why don't you come with me, little girl On a magic carpet ride You don't know what we can see Why don't you tell your dreams to me Fantasy will set you free Close your eyes, girl Look inside, girl Let the sound take you away Last night I held Aladdin's lamp And so I wished that I could stay Before the thing could answer me Well, someone came and took the lamp away I looked around, a lousy candle's all I foundGet your motor runnin'Head out on the highway Looking for adventure In whatever comes our way Yeah, darlin', go and make it happen Take the world in a love embrace Fire all of your guns at once And explode into space I like smoke and lightnin'Heavy metal thunder Racing with the wind And the feeling that I'm under Yeah, darlin', go and make it happen Take the world in a love embrace Fire all of your guns at once And explode into space Like a true nature's child We were born, born to be wild We can climb so high I never wanna die Born to be wild Born to be wildYou know I've smoked a lot of grass O' Lord, I've popped a lot of pills But I never touched nothin'That my spirit could kill You know, I've seen a lot of people walkin' 'round With tombstones in their eyes But the pusher don't care Ah, if you live or if you die God damn, the pusher God damn, I say the pusher I said God damn God damn the pusher man You know the dealer, the dealer is a man With the love grass in his hand Oh but the pusher is a monster Good God, he's not a natural man The dealer for a nickel Lord, will sell you lots of sweet dreams Ah, but the pusher ruin your body Lord, he'll leave your He'll leave your mind to screamStarin' at the boob tube, turnin' on the big knob Tryin' to find some life in the waste land Fin'ly found a program, gonna deal with Mary Jane Ready for a trip into hate land Obnoxious Joe comes on the screen Along with his guest self-righteous Sam And one more guy who doesn't count His hair and clothes are too far out While pushin' back his glasses Sam is sayin' casually"I was elected by the masses"And with that in mind he starts to unwind A vicious attack on the finest of grasses Well it's evil, wicked, mean and nasty And it will ruin our fair country Well, it will hook your Sue and Johnny All will pay that disagree with me Misinformation Sam and Joe Are feeding to the nation But the one who didn't count counted them out By exposing all their false quotations Faced by a very awkward situation This is all he'd say to save the dayWhen rain drops fall and you feel low Ah, do you ever think it's useless Do you feel like letting go Do you ever sit and do you wonder Will the world ever change And just how long will it take To have it all rearranged Tell me why these things are still the same Tell me why no one can seem to learn from mistakes Take my hand if you don't know where you're goin'I'll understand, I've lost the way myself Oh, don't take that old road it leads to nowhere We must return before the clock strikes twelve It's so easy to do nothin'When you're busy night and day Take a step in one direction And take a step the other way So don't quit tryin' when you stumble Don't give up should you fall Keep on searchin' for the passway That will lead you through the wall Don't look back or you'll be left behind Don't look back or you will never find peace of mindYour eyes are moist, you scream and shout As though you were a man possessed From deep inside comes rushing forth All the anguish you suppressed Up on your wall hangs your degree Your parents craved so much for you And though you're trained to make your mark You still don't quite know what to do It's never too late to start all over again To love the people you caused the pain And help them learn your name Oh, no, not too late It's never too late to start all over again Well, it's much too late to start again To try and find a little bliss So on your woman and your child You release your bitterness You drift apart some more each day You feel the guilt and loneliness And the God of your childhood you can't find To save you from your emptiness It's never too late to start all over again To love the people you caused the pain And help them learn your name Oh, no, not too late It's never too late to start all over againOnce the religious, the hunted, and weary Chasing the promise of freedom and hope Came to this country to build a new vision Far from the reaches of kingdom and pope Like good Christians, some would burn the witches Later some got slaves to gather riches But still from near and far to seek America They came by thousands, to court the wild But she just patiently smiled and bore them a child To be their spirit and guiding light And once the ties with the crown had been broken Westward in saddle and wagon, they went And 'til the railroad linked ocean to ocean Many the lives which had come to an end While we bullied, stole, and bought our homeland We began the slaughter of the red manYou say it was this morning when you last saw your good friend Lying on the pavement with a misery on his brain Stoned on some new potion he found upon the wall Of some unholy bathroom in some ungodly hall He only had a dollar to live on till next Monday But he spent it all on comfort for his mind Did you say you think he's blind Someone should call his parents, a sister or a brother And they'll come to take him back home on a bus But he'll always be a problem to his poor and puzzled mother Yeah he'll always be another one of us He said he wanted heaven but prayin' was too slow So he bought a one-way ticket on an airline made of snow Did you say you saw your good friend flyin' low Flyin' low, dyin' slow You say it was this morning when you last saw your good friend Lying on the pavement with a misery on his brain Stoned on some new potion he found upon the wall Of some unholy bathroom in some ungodly hall He only had a dollar to live on till next Monday He said he wanted heaven but prayin' was too slow So he bought a one-way ticket on an airline made of snow Did you say you saw your good friend flyin' low Dyin' slow, flyin' low Did you say you saw your good friend flyin' low Dyin' slow, flyin' low Blinded by snowWe'll call you when you're six years old And drag you to the factory To train your brain for eighteen years With promise of security But then you're free And forty years you waste to chase the dollar sign So you may die in Florida At the pleasant age of sixty nine The water's getting hard to drink We've mangled up the country side The air will choke you when you breathe We're all committing suicide But it's alright It's progress folks keep pushin' till your body rots Will strip the earth of all its green And then divide her into parking lots But there's nothing you and I can do You and I are only two What's right and wrong is hard to say Forget about it for today We'll stick our heads into the sand Just pretend that all is grand Then hope that everything turns out okShe asked me maybe I could share her sorrow For all the men that tried to treat her wrong Though just a baby, awaiting her tomorrow It's rock me baby, rock me baby, all night long She needs an answer to her confusion Someone to guide her with tenderness But when she's askin' for a solution All that she gets, you know, is something like this I don't know where we come from Don't know where we're goin' to But if all this should have a reason We would be the last to know So let's just hope there is a promised land Hang on 'til then As best as you can Ev'rybody's ills, you know it fills her with compassion That's why she tries to save the world alone She helps the needy in her own fashion And tries to give them all her own She needs an answer to her confusion Someone to guide her with tenderness But when she's askin' for a solution All that she gets, you know, is Something like this
