enough And start heading for the door There's a very strange vibration Piercing me right to the core It says "turn around you fool You know you'll love him more and more"Tell me why  is it so Don't want to let you go No, I never can say goodbye boy, ooh, no no I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, no no no, ooh, ooh Hey, I never can say goodbye boy, ooh, baby I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, no no no, ooh, ooh I never can say goodbye, no no no, I I never can say goodbye I keep thinking that our problems Soon are all gonna work out But there's that same unhappy feeling There's that anguish, there's that doubt It's that same old dizzy hang up I can't get by without youThere is nothing, boy, that can stop my course I will hold you tight, never let you go Tomorrow's party will never end Like a bud in spring, our love will bloom and grow Your eyes to me are precious stones On a face that's made of solid gold When I hold your hand I want to cry And your loving arms to protect me from the cold You are my world You are my world You are my world You are my world The soul inside now belongs to you I'm drowing in a love so deep We will overcome those ups and downs So happiness is forever ours to keep I will follow you to the end of time I will be the blood flowing through your veins I will ride with you till the end of the line You will be my everything, my world My worldI never cried the way I cried over you As I put down the telephone and the world it carried on Somewhere else, someone else is crying too Another man has lost a friend, I bet he feels the way I do And now I'm left without, but you're here within As I watch the sun go down, watching the world fade away All the memories of you come rushing back to me As I watch the sun go down, watching the world fade away All I want to do is kiss you once goodbye Summer comes, I remember how we'd march We'd march for love and pride, together arm in arm Tears have turned, turned to anger and contempt I'll never let you down, a battle I have found And all the dreams we had, I will carry on As I watch the sun go down, watching the world fade away All the memories of you come rushing back to me As I watch the sun go down, watching the world fade away All I want to do is kiss you once goodbye, goodbye Goodbye, goodbyeI watch your window I shake so scared Spying from my room With nervous unrest Night after night your fingers caressing The skin that is so fair You slowly undress Soon we will be together Until then, so cold the night Soon we will be together Until then, so cold the night I know that you know That I'm here each night Watching and praying The time is now right For me to undress and caress you Until then I'll just sit here and dream Soon we will be together Until then, so cold the night Soon we will be together Until then, so cold the night Cold the night Cold the nightTime will say nothing but I told you so Time only knows the price we have to pay If I could tell you, I would let you know If we should weep when clowns put on their show If we should stumble when musicians play Time will say nothing but I told you so There are no fortunes to be told, although Because I love you more than I can say If I could tell you, I would let you know The winds must come from somewhere when they blow There must be reasons why the leaves decay Time will say nothing but I told you so Perhaps the roses really want to grow The vision seriously intends to stay If I could tell you, I would let you know Suppose the lions all get up and go And all the brooks and soldiers run away Will time say nothing but I told you so If I could tell you, I would let you know If I could tell you If I could tell you If I could tell you If I could tell you If I could tell youSo, boy where you go, what you do Hey there boy, what is wrong with you No future, no hope, just broken dreams You spend your days wondering why I'll be your friend, I'll be around I'll be everything you need I'll be your friend, I'll be around I'll be everything you need Hey young man, why you cry Don't you know You've got to try a little bit harder You've got to stand on your own two feet Never let them drag you down Hey there boy This prejudice and ignorance we can overcome I'll be your friend, I'll be around I'll be everything you need I'll be your friend, I'll be around I'll be everything you need I'll be your friend, I'll be around I'll be everything you need I'll be your friend, I'll be around I'll be everything you needLike the knife of a thief that's held close to the throat I'm threatened by you and that cruel way you gloat You once turned me on, now it all seems so remote You broke me in pieces, you cherished each blow The harder you hit me, the stronger I grow I'll leave you tomorrow, take my pride and I'll go You may break the skin but you can't kill the soul I've had all I can take You may break the skin but you can't kill the soul I've had all I can take I'm leaving tomorrow I'm leaving tomorrow I'm leaving I've had all I can take Don't tell me you love me, your tears are too late Your trap was deception, and I took the bait The animal in you, you can't keep at bay I'm not your possession to treat as you wish Your silence will slowly destroy you each day I'm leaving tomorrow, my love for life is great You may break the skin but you can't kill the soul I've had all I can take You may break the skin but you can't kill the soul I've had all I can takeNow I know where you go What you do when you're away from me Who he is, what's his name Where he lives, all your aims But no longer will I play your foolish game You took me heart and you tore it in too many pieces But I glued it all together again There's a fire down in me That burns oh, so bright With a longing, with a yearning to be free I won't cry, I won't cry No, I won't waste my tears I'll get by, I'll survive without you I gave you the stars I gave you the moon and my heart But you took them all and threw them all away I don't want you, I don't need you I will survive I've got strength enough down inside for two When you leave, when you leave Just look the other way I won't waste my breath, my tears There's nothing to sayAll night you'd lay asleep Enfolded in my arms Breathing slow and sweet I never understood How it would prove to be Such a luxury to feel Your hand, warm in my hand Your kiss on my cheek Lovers and friends Are all that matter You'll never know how much it Came to mean to me To have you by my side In battles lost and won And now I understand These things can never be Guaranteed I wish I could recall Each mundane tenderness Remember every look, each word Preserve every breath Each kiss, each caress Lovers and friends Are all that matter I never thought that I would Watch you drowning Far from any sea, on crumpled sheets White sand in your eyes
