hurts, love scars Love wounds and mars Any heart, not tough Nor strong enough To take a lot of pain Take a lot of pain Love is like a cloud Holds a lot of rain Love hurts Love hurts I'm young, I know But even so I know a thing or two I've learned from you I've really learned a lot Really learned a lot Love is like a stove It burns you when it's hot Love hurts Love hurtsBye bye love Bye bye happiness Hello loneliness I think I'm gonna cry Bye bye love Bye bye sweet caress Hello emptiness I feel like I could die Bye bye my love goodbye There goes my baby with someone new She sure looks happy, I sure am blue She was my baby 'till he stepped in Goodbye to romance that might've been Bye bye love Bye bye happiness Hello loneliness I think I'm gonna cry Bye bye love Bye bye sweet caress Hello emptiness I feel like I could die Bye bye my love goodbyeI'll never let you see The way my broken heart is hurtin' me I've got my pride and I know how to hide All my sorrow and pain I'll do my cryin' in the rain If I wait for cloudy skies You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes You'll never know that I still love you so Though the heartaches remain I'll do my cryin' in the rain Rain drops fallin' from heaven Could never wash away my misery But since we're not together I look for stormy weather To hide these tears I hope you'll never see Some day when my cryin's done I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun I may be a fool but till then darling you'll Never see me complain I'll do my cryin' in the rain I'll do my cryin' in the rain I'll do my cryin' in the rainWake

But don't say I'm in a jam You can tell her I had to see the world Or tell her that my ship set sail You can say she better not wait for me But don't tell her I'm in jail Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail Take a message to Mary But don't tell her what I've done Please don't mention the stagecoach And the shot from a careless gun You can tell her I had to change my plans And cancel out the wedding day But please don't mention my lonely cell Where I'm gonna pine away Until my dying day Take a message to Mary But don't tell her all you know My heart's aching for Mary Lord knows I miss her so Just tell her I went to Timbuktu Tell her I'm searching for gold You can say she better find someone new To cherish and to hold Oh, Lord, this cell is coldI want you to tell me why you walked out on me I'm so lonesome every day I want you to know that since you walked out on me Nothin' seems to be the same old way Think about the love that burns within my heart for you The good times we had before you went away, oh me Walk right back to me this minute Bring your love to me, don't send it I'm so lonesome every day I want you to tell me why you walked out on me I'm so lonesome every day I want you to know that since you walked out on me Nothin' seems to be the same old way Think about the love that burns within my heart for you The good times we had before you went away, oh me Walk right back to me this minute Bring your love to me, don't send it I'm so lonesome every dayOn a weekend pass I wouldn't have had time To get home and marry, that baby of mine So I went to the Chaplain and he authorized Me to send for my Ebony Eyes My Ebony Eyes was coming to me From out of the skies on Flight 1203 In an hour or two, I would whisper "I do"To my beautiful Ebony Eyes Spoken:The plane was way overdue So I went inside to the airline's desk and I said:"Sir, I wonder why 1203 is so late"He said: "Oh they probably took off late Or they may have run into some turbulent weather and had to alter the course"I went back outside and waited at the gate And I watched the beacon light from the control tower As it whipped through the dark ebony skies if it were searching for â€“My Ebony Eyes And then came the announcement over the loudspeaker"Would those having relatives or friends on Flight number 1203 Please report to the chapel across the street at once"
