You keep calling it a crash and burn Just wait your turn You might have time to speak There barely was a lesson learned Cause in return No favors back to me I'm sure it tasted oh so sweet But it was never good enough for me I bit the tongue behind my teeth It was never good enough for me You said you'd always keep your word Show me what you're after I thought you promised me the world Tell me what you're after Go on and take it way too far Cause here we are, waiting once again You said you'd always keep your word Show me what you're after Just a little faster Are mine the only eyes that see, so steadily This cut and dry routine Even when you're by my side I still need time to feel the companyIt's gonna get harder from here We've gotta get smarter to make it out alive'cause you say stop and we say go Don't wanna be your tenth caller on the radio So don't bother cutting me off short tonight We let our words speak for themselves Don't take it all so far Don't make it that much harder Than it already is for you to stand alone For you To wake up knowing you've got the day To take on without feeling okay To make yourself unwilling to sleep away Don't take off running without my say Don't pay that price you thought you'd pay You've got the choice, you've got the time of day Just don't sleep away the pain Hold on tight to the things you're given The camera caught it all Aren't we all forgiven now 'cause you say stop and we say go The world outside is calling on the telephone They need answers so we'll let them know tonight We let our words speak for themselves But maybe I'm not right We're so damaged by the sunlight Can we make it through together'cause honey, I don't like this kind of weather When I'm with youIt's 3 in the morning And I'm still not sleeping Cause I am finally running your race The mountains you've been climbing Seem like they have steepened Since I decided to pick up the pace If the whole world told me I should disappear Could I fall right next to you Just let me burn the night away Oh, baby let me burn the night away By thinking of the simple things you say to me That get me through the day You keep me wide awake So don't look back The hourglass is running empty You've got me buried with your every move Your fine line have me at a loss of memory I'm right beside you in an empty roomA cold night wasn't trouble enough for him Another swallow never seemed like enough for him They say, "The past is the past"But it never treated me like this He couldn't ask for A better understanding of how What goes around comes back around twice as fast He's got no hope for a cure So he'll put himself to sleep Now we just sit back, we sit back While we watch all of them react So tell me what to tell you When the world won't listen The start to the finish Come on and let me hear it Speak out and use up All the time you're given The start to the finish Come on and let me hear it Go on, go ahead and tell your storyCold afternoon I sleep in some Back of the room Avoid the sun You turned off the light And I lost a lung You called it a night You had me won Who told you to leave me all alone Leave me in the dark, leave me in the cold Who told you to leave before I could show You half of the man you wanted to know But I had to face your last goodbye The look on my face, my bloodshot eyes So who won the war Deep down inside I can't decide Only the dark can feel my touch No kind of remark could burn this much'cause I'm as cold as December And I won't surrender Until you give me back my lifeYou can't find a reason Why the world keeps passing by Occupy these changing seasons With the flooded streets of night'cause this youthful advantage Fades while the sand is Dripping from the hour glass Want a taste of the fast life But nobody sleeps tight When the after hours pass Don't hang your head so low There's no turning back, no turning back You put on quite a show There's no turning back, lady in black Hit the scene, something's missing Where's the sparkle in your eye You're up so high, everybody's listening To the static of the nightI'd hate to break it to you now But that reoccurring sound In your ear makes it perfect Was it clear, my whole purpose I'm just fine with or without Having this inner selfish doubt I'll fall hard, you'll fall harder I'm along, you're so startled Break a sweat Desperate lover, do you feel all alone I fell asleep on your deathbed In a hole where your head rests I'm facing truth so unfamiliar I just close my eyes and Fall asleep on your deathbed Can we be resurrected I'm facing truth so unfamiliar I'm your saint Will you be my savior I always hoped to bring this down Words exchanging all around You spoke quick, I spoke faster Take your pick, take mine after But the time went ticking And hearts went missing It's not what I waited onI walk, you run Feel so outdone You always wanted it to be one on one I cost, you're free Make me believe That you've been innocent 'til proven guilty So, scrape my hands and knees Softer now, I plead for your forgiveness Cause the world can't stand to witness You keep tearing me down Looks like I met my match today Play me in everything Make me a rival But you still don't see that you're Sore winner, a sore winner Losing is not your thing You can't hold the title But you still don't see that you're Sore winner, a sore winner I want, you feed Pick up your speed There can't be saving if it's already been won I play for keeps but you don't listen Remember me  I'm what you're missing Missing out on Stuck in this competitionFussing and fighting, we, back at it again I know that its my fault you don't understand I got memories, this is crazy You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know Good with ma, good with pa, cool with all my friends I should try, to decide, want to let you in, but  that means memories, and it's crazy You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know Girl I really wanna work this out cause I'm tired of fighting And I really hope you still want me the way I want you I said I really wanna work this out, but girl I'm trying, its no excuse, no excuse I got this Icebox where my heart used to be Icebox where my heart used to be  I'm so Cold I'm So Cold I'm So Cold I'm So Cold  I'm so Cold I'm So Cold I'm So Cold I'm So Cold I got this Icebox where my heart used to be Icebox where my heart used to be I'm so Cold I'm So Cold I'm So Cold I'm So Cold I'm so Cold I'm So Cold I'm So Cold I'm So Cold Why can't I get it right  Just can't let it go I open up she let me down I won't feel that no more I got memories this is crazy You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know I don't mean to take it out on you baby but I can't help it Cause my heart is in the same old condition that baby left it I apologize for making you cry Look me in my eyes and promise you won't do me the sameYou've got to know by now That stepping in and out won't bring you down Until you make it definite6:15 - sacrifice your rest I thought you said you're different From those who believe in it They believe in universities Oh, not another mind made up For doing nothing more than all you see They've got no more room to breathe Until we just get them to Say, we'll make them say That we've been down and out all day If your education brings you home Why are you still away So give it up if you're not still trying to Hold it up in your four-time windowed room I've got the feeling that you're not Using up all of your best bets On plans that you still don't have set For those who believe in it They believe Until we just get them to
