No I won't..  No I won't..  No it don't come easy And no it don't come fast Lock me up inside your garden Take me to the riverside Fire, burning me up Desire, taking me so much higher And leaving me whole There you were In your black dress Moving slow, to the sadness I could watch you dance for hours I could take you by my side Fire, burning me up Desire, taking me so much higher And leaving me...Fire, turning me on Desire, taking me so much higher And leaving me wholeWell, I've been running from something Twenty years in the car Down a road that's leading me nowhere And we drive through the farmland No one knows where we're from Could I kiss you and make you a queen Or something in between Do you want to see it The place where I was freed Cause in my mind, I need it But you're nowhere near to me...Move to New York City Take your woman by hand Leave her there with her things on the doorstep And there's no way around it Could this be our last dance Just fall asleep with the T.V  darling I'll be back again Do you want to see it The place where I am free Cause in my mind, I've been there And there's no one here but meBreaking up with your breakdowns Standing tall in your white gown You're going nowhere, you're going fast You're slowing down but you'll never last Take your time honey Take your time It's the wrong dream, with the wrong man With a cold gun, in your wrong hand Get it right this time, get it off your mind Let the summer rain bring you rest And shame and love Carve your name in a black stone Swear to God we won't let go If you can't love babe, then you can't hurt We take the good times, with the worst Take your time honey Take your time It's the wrong dream, with the wrong man With a cold gun, in your wrong hand Get it right this time, get it off your mind Let the summer rain bring you rest And shame and loveThe day is done, and now we're older The feeling's gone, so now you'll show her Where love went wrong, on your shoulder You're all alone, and you can't take it You're just too tired to suffocate it And all along we'll just fake it But I tried I tried, goodbye You try to breathe, you try to save it But it marks your skin, until they break it Well could you call when They're taking all that you left for meYou need a reason for the things I do I need a miracle to see me through I give you everything I've got inside If you just stay here tonight My hands are tired and I'm rolling the dice My legs are broken, I ain't up for a fight I make it rain from an empty sky If you just stay here tonight You'll be the last one picking up the pieces You'll be the last one standing up strong You'll be the last one making all the right things wrong You need a lover in the first degree I need a woman who believes in me I shine the way through the darkest light If you just stay here tonight My heart is aching and I'm down on the ?My will is weak and I'm falling again I get back up and try to make things right If you just stay here tonight You'll be the last one picking up the pieces You'll be the last one standing up strong You'll be the last one making all the right things wrong As the days go by, the days go by, the days go by
