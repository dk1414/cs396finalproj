Been travelling these wide roads For so long My heart's been far from you Ten thousand miles gone Oh, I wanna come near and give Every part of me But there's blood on my hands And my lips are unclean In my darkness I remember Momma's words reoccur to me"Surrender to the good Lord And he'll wipe your slate clean"Take me to your river I wanna go Oh, go, take me to your river I wanna know Dip me in your smooth water As I go in As a man with many crimes, come up for air As my sins flow down the JordanBaby, baby, baby I'm coming home To your tender sweet loving You're my one and only woman The world leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, girl You're the only one that I want I wanna be around I wanna be around, girl I wanna be around, girl You, I wanna be around Baby, how I'd be grieving If you wanted to leave me all alone now By myself, I don't want nobody else The world leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, girl You're the only one that I want I wanna be around I wanna be around, girl I wanna be around, girl You, I wanna be aroundDon't wanna get ahead of myself Feeling things I've never felt It's kinda hard for me to explain Her personality and everything Brings me to my knees, oh She shines me up like gold on my arm I wanna take it slow but it's so hard I love to see her face in daylight It's more than just our bodies at night But she's really tempting me, oh ooo Do you think I'm being foolish if I don't rush in I-I-I-I I'm scared to death that she might be it That the love is real, that the shoe might fit She might just be my everything and beyond Space and time in the afterlife Will she have my kids  Will she be my wife She might just be my everything and beyond I wanna bring her 'round to meet ya I think you'd like her kind demeanor I know that Grandma would've loved her, like she was her own She makes me feel at home, ooh Do you think I'm being foolish if I don't rush in I-I-I-II've been holding my breath I've been counting to ten over something you said I've been holding back tears while you're throwing back beers I'm alone in my bed You know I, I'm afraid of change Guess that's why we stay the same So tell me to leave I'll pack my bags, get on the road Find someone that loves you better than I do, darling, I know'Cause you remind me every day I'm not enough, but I still stay Feels like a lifetime Just tryna get by while we're dying inside I've done a lot of things wrong Loving you being one, but I can't move on You know I, I'm afraid of change Guess that's why we stay the sameI don't want much I just wanna be a better man To my baby Meet me off for good luck I was singing with them Jezebels Under perfume sheets Got a golden smile, heart overflowing But got us in love, but it wasn't enough What can I do  What can I do To get back to your heart I'd swim the Mississippi river If you would give me another start, girl All night long I was out Out till the morning But baby, you're tender Lost when I'm longing Baby please, I'm down on my knees begging I thirst for you, girl Baby, I'm running to your well What can I do  What can I do To get back to your heart I'd swim the Mississippi river If you would give me another start, girlYou
