I've been reading books of old The legends and the myths Achilles and his gold Hercules and his gifts Spider-Man's control And Batman with his fists And clearly I don't see myself upon that list But she said, where d'you wanna go How much you wanna risk I'm not looking for somebody With some superhuman gifts Some superhero Some fairytale bliss Just something I can turn to Somebody I can kiss I want something just like this Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo Oh, I want something just like this Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo Oh, I want something just like this I want something just like thisI used to rule the world Seas would rise when I gave the word Now in the morning, I sleep alone Sweep the streets I used to own I used to roll the dice Feel the fear in my enemies' eyes Listen as the crowd would sing"Now the old king is dead, long live the king"One minute, I held the key Next, the walls were closed on me And I discovered that my castles stand Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'Roman cavalry choirs are singin'Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain Once you'd gone, there was never Never an honest word And that was when I ruled the worldCome up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry You don't know how lovely you are I had to find you, tell you I need you And tell you I set you apart Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions No, let's go back to the start Runnin' in circles, comin' up tails Heads on a science apart Nobody said it was easy It's such a shame for us to part Nobody said it was easy No one ever said it would be this hard Oh, take me back to the start I was just guessin' at numbers and figures Pullin' the puzzles apart Questions of science, science and progress Do not speak as loud as my heart And tell me you love me, and come back and haunt me Oh, and I rush to the start Runnin' in circles, chasin' our tails Comin' back as we areLook at the stars, look how they shine for you And everything you do Yeah, they were all yellow I came along, I wrote a song for you And all the things you do And it was called "Yellow"So then I took my turn Oh, what a thing to have done And it was all yellow Your skin, oh, yeah, your skin and bones Turn into something beautiful You know, you know I love you so You know I love you so I swam across, I jumped across for you Oh, what a thing to do'Cause you were all yellow I drew a line, I drew a line for you Oh, what a thing to do And it was all yellow Your skin, oh, yeah, your skin and bones Turn into something beautiful And you know, for you, I'd bleed myself dry For you, I'd bleed myself dryWhen you try your best, but you don't succeed When you get what you want, but not what you need When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep Stuck in reverse And the tears come streamin' down your face When you lose somethin' you can't replace When you love someone, but it goes to waste Could it be worse Lights will guide you home And ignite your bones And I will try to fix you And high up above or down below When you're too in love to let it go But if you never try, you'll never know Just what you're worth Lights will guide you home And ignite your bones And I will try to fix youAnd said drink from me, drink from me That we shoot across the sky Symphony That we shoot across the sky Pour on a...Drink from me, drink from me That we shoot across the sky Symphony That we shoot across the sky Oh, angel sent from up above You know you make my world light up When I was down, when I was hurt You came to lift me up Life is a drink and love's a drug Oh now I think I must be miles up When I was a river dried up You came to rain a flood You said drink from me, drink from me When I was so thirsty Poured on a symphony Now I just can't get enough Put your wings on me, wings on me When I was so heavy Poured on a symphony
