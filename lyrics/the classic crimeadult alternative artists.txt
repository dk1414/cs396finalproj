Life Life can be Life can be senseless Life can be Life can be senseless I try to make sense of it Flashing fake smiles at my friends Beats defenselessness I cannot clean up the mess without making more It's time to settle the score I can't be charming if you can't be charmed If you gave me everything I want I will disarm You are the only one who can stop me from giving up And just my luck I'm not done with you yet I'm not done with you yet You always have the fall before the lift Whether you drink to remember or drink to forget what you did I am the closest thing to a modern-day poet fraud But I met God in a velvet Elvis painting that I painted myself In a bar where I was pulling off the bottom shelf When I had to quit before I killed myself I met him there And I was scared And so I asked God if He could fix my flaws And He said I gave them to you I know they are killing youI wish I could play the violin I'd play 'til tears rolled down your cheek and chin And if you sang along We could write the saddest song Sometimes, I indulge my every whim And piece by piece, I build the cell I'm in But, I only stay here long enough To write the saddest song I dreamt I stood on a hill that I wished was a mountain To look back on all my accomplishments Well, they must have been small Because I couldn't seem to find them So, I took a leap off of the precipice I wish I could play piano well Iâ€™d hit the keys that make your spirit swell And if you sang along We could write the saddest song I dreamt I stood on a hill that I wished was a mountain To look back on all my accomplishments Well, they must have been small Because I couldn't seem to find them So, I took a leap off of the precipiceEvery whisper is a gunshot in a crowded terminal Every cry for help so quiet it is barely audible Every callous numbing feeling gets invited to the bar Instead of salt on all your wounds You pour well whiskey on your scars But you're not hard No one sees who you are You ward off the drunken stares at last call But you've got what I want You've got what I want Driftwood Call me a name if it feels good I'll be the break where your ache has stood All of your failures are widowers But I'm still right here And you're not hard I can see who you are And I'll work hard To bring you back to the startA young man lacking sense Sells his soul to circumstance His movements indecise He does not know that it will cost his life She's a harlot Boisterous and rebellious Her husband gone, this father's daughter Leads the young man to the slaughter In shadows you sleep Too careless to see The things that matter most  So much that when you are faced with the truth You look like you've seen a ghost  A young man lacking sense Pushes on to consequence He lives to feed his flesh The scavengers will clean up what is left She's a harlot Simple and persuasive With seduction she always gets her way Her bed will be his early grave"Purpose is everything"A hopeless romantic sings Give me my chemicals I've fallen in love with one'Cause it never does me wrong Except when it's gone Why don't you wake me up from my sleep tonight And in the morning light, I will face you Why don't you wake me up from this wasted life And in the morning light, I will face you Hindsight is everything In the darkness that morning brings The shadows from sunrise The contrast is deafening From the blur of the midnight street To the morning of black and white Why don't you wake me up from my sleep tonight And in the morning light, I will face you Why don't you wake me up from this wasted life And in the morning light, I will face youJenny left from Idaho and made her home in Capitol Hill In a 300 square foot studio above a coffee shop near the Broadway Grill And every night she walks the block to trade in her time for cheap thrills And everyone she meets is cool, but just out of reach and it kills She used to spend her nights by firelight, and singing to the stars Now she's ours Now she's ours Kevin left from Denver where the air is thin and people are nice And he traded in for sea level, for misty rain, what a bitter compromise For now he felt like he belonged to those who understood him But he sold his soul to fight right in and he watched his friends desert him He used to spend his nights by candlelight and drinking wine to vinyl Now he's ours Now he's ours It's a city of orphans Who had nowhere to go So they cashed in their dreams Headed northwest to the sea and they called it their home But most don't belong here We're all running away And we'll drain you dry of all semblance of life We don't give we just take, take, takeYou clutch the cross around your neck And hope to God there's still time left You turn back down the path to find your way But in the dusty summer breeze Of this ghost town you hear the sea It's salted crashing melody still haunts you to this day And it says where where you when I Called you to be the wild And now your ships set sail And you're stuck in a prison If you are trying to dance alone in this life Then do it right But if you are dying to live somewhere on the other side There's no such thing as spare time You bought all your philosophies And carved out your philanthropy It didn't take you much to do your part But you closed off opportunity With narrow cold hypocrisy And in the end you traded petty comforts for your heartMaybe I'm the bastard romantic who will watch you sleep I never had anybody before you to teach me anything of love Maybe you're the constant reminder of what I've gained Before you came around I was a kid in the crowd without a name But now I have everything And I still want more Until I hear the trumpet sound Until my body is in the ground Until I finally find the source I want more I want more I want more Maybe I'm the bastard romantic who will watch you dream As a kid my father could never admit to loving me So now I pour my heart out despite losing all control And I'm afraid to speak Cause it goes deeper than my words can go All I know Is I want more Until I hear the trumpet sound Until my body is in the ground Until I finally find the source I want more I want more I want moreMidnight stop on the street Red light feet on the ground And it feels right Quiet besides the engine I Escape into paradise It goes green And I'm back at top speed Not another body in sight I am this perspective I'm the witness tonight I am alone But I'm alive Every drop of holy water Comes from the ocean From the ocean Every atom in my body Comes from exploding stars Billions of years ago Outside craning your neck Blue sky stretching your back with your arms wide Taking deep breaths to purify Pretty sure that you could be certified There is no God damned thing in sight It's all deemed good in his eyes You are this perspective Here to witness the lightTossed by the tempest of life A victim to storms I contrive It feels like the best is behind And I can't go back The eye of the storm satisfies I watch the chaos from inside But the wind turns and I realize That I can't go back That I can't go back So I go Pressing on through the wind and the waves If I drown let me go so that you can be saved It don't matter if people remember my name I have lived I have lived So let me die I fight against what lies beneath It's just my will against the sea I've never been one to give in Of all the virtues I have lacked The need to fight has been my anchor
