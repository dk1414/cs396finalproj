The wind's whistling My mind's twisting I was making myself the usual cup of tea When the doorbell strangely rang Because I've been up here for a while I'm starting to feel the monotony of the tower block I'm not so manic now I can uphold the weight of those neighbours And she's lifting and throwing to the wall The post-natal harmonies of youth When this younger man, twenty-five Advantageously took away her pride The wind's whistling My mind's twisting I was making myself the usual cup of tea When the doorbell strangely rang I staggered shaking slowly to the door Through the frosted panel I could see you Your intentions as a salesman truly cush You endeavoured as a psycho just to push And whilst lifting and throwing to the wall My puny structure of an ageing O AP No reason why you chose my flat Breathing deeply in a tranceShe's taking up the room in my head Like all your rooms hook up with a bed If you're happy with me and believe what I say Be strong enough to let her walk away Do you kiss her lips when you say goodbye And all of the people you've been with before And the keys on the end of her ring fit your door So I smile and I chat when I see her in town Expect me to be her when the lights are turned down Do you kiss her lips when you say goodbye Do you miss her hips when you hear me sigh Are you in her car when I take the bus home Is she in your arms when I walk alone Do you miss her hips when you hear me sigh Do you kiss her lips when you say goodbye And after all this i'm expect to like her You lie to my face when you say you don't see her To get my revenge I wanted to spike her And laugh in her face when she's tripping with fearIs it asking too much to be given time To know these songs and to sing them Is it asking too much of my vacant smile And my laugh and lies that bring them But as the stars are going out And this stage is full of nothing And the friends have all but gone For my life, my God, I'm singing We'll take our hearts outside, leave our lives behind And watch the stars go out We'll take our hearts outside, leave our lives behind And watch the stars go out Is it asking too much of my favourite friends To take these songs for real Is it asking too much of my partner's hands To take these songs for real But as the stars are going out And this stage is full of nothing And the friends have all but gone For my life, my God, I'm singingTalking is useless When your cards have all been shown I'll make you feel bitter And I'll never use the phone'Cause I'm not the kind of person Soft enough to cry I'm not the kind of person To hide when I can fight So breakout now let the feelings out And take the blame away And leave the past for another day Please no more talk today breakout now Let the feelings out and take the blame away And leave the past for another day Please no more talk today'Cause I'm not the kind of person Who likes to hang around I'm not the kind of person To sympathize with self indulgenceIt's all right, I'm just a girl, she said Talk down to me and take me to bed I don't feel, I don't think And I don't really matter at all Kiss me in darkness and turn out the light Pretend you're with someone else tonight You don't feel, you don't think And I don't really understand why I'm a person who speaks, I'm a person who thinks But you hope I'll forget 'cause you ply me with drinks And you cannot buy me and you cannot use me But I know that you want to try It's all right, I'm just a girl, she said You can't buy me and take me to bed'Cause I think, 'cause I feel And you don't really matter at all I'm a person who speaks, I'm a person who thinks But you hope I'll forget 'cause you ply me with drinks And you cannot buy me and you cannot use me But I know that you want to tryIf you need somebody around you Well then I'll be the one who's there If you need somebody to listen Well then I'll be the one who's there But you seem to think you'll manage alone I'll be around and I'll be waiting for your call If you need somebody to love you Well, then I'll be the one who's there Yes, I'll be the one who's there...But you seem to think you'll manage alone I'll be around and I'll be waiting for your call If you need somebody to love you Well, then I'll be the one who's there Yes, I'll be the one who's there...I'll be the one who's there Yes, I'll be the one who's thereWalking home from work tonight Your letter warm, I'm holding tight Said you want to see me soon I phoned you late this afternoon The bar we first met seems alive I'll see you there at eight tonight Shouldn't think like this But is there something in us meeting now All this time, I've waited knowing Though I've changed my heart's still showing I'll wear a new dress, wash my clothes I'll wear the earrings that you chose If the man you've grown to be Is more Morrison than Morrisey I'll tell you straight as we undress That things got better when you left And though I've banned your name since then I'll call it with my dying breath No-one else would have me So I've made this day of all days The day I see you againLet me tell of a time When the world was in rhyme with the sound of our laughter Montmartre shone above For forbidden hours of hunger and of love Unaware in our youth of the sobering truth Of the years that came after We laughed at other men for we were heroes then And heaven smiled above La boheme, la boheme Oh hungry you, oh hungry me La boheme, la boheme See the old world that could not see All those innocent hearts Who imagined their arts could be casually mastered I miss them every one For the sands of time have run away for each and all But it seems that our schemes were impossible dreams That could never have lasted For when we walked at last the great parade had passed And spring had lost its wayAnd when you laugh I'm home And know that when you laugh I feel like I'm a better man Listening to every word Forgetting every lie I've heard Only when you laugh I belong And when you smile I play along To every weak joke And mind game that you choose to play And don't believe abandoning Or warring every girl may bring When every time you smile I'm yours smiling too These are the days when wars are won These are the days when the world has begun To live together Through gritted teeth forever And when you cry I am wrong Every time you cry I end up making other plans And when all the stick I take She brings every claim I make It's every time you cry it's crazy I'm still yoursI'll be around anywhere Any place you want me I'll be around anywhere Any time I'm free In time the stakes will change Even predestination couldn't stay I don't mind I don't mind'Cause I'll be around anywhere Any place you want me I'll be around anywhere Any time I'm free In time this place is mine You know the inspiration in my smile I don't mind I don't mind'Cause I'll be around anywhere Any place you want me I'll be around anywhere Any time I'm free
