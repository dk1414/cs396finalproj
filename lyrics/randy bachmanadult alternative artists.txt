Somebody hurts, somebody cries Somebody breaks, and somebody lies Scared me half to death, we need to talk, she said I brace myself for the worst Whenever you hear those words You know something don't fit Something went wrong Some things don't work And something gone wrong That's just the  way it is We need to talk, she said We need to talk, talk all about it We need to talk, no doubt about it Cross all the T’s, connect all the dots Baby we need to talk Whatever I said or did, we can get over it You see nothing is impossible, Nothing is too hard Nothing in between that can tear us apart That's just the way it is We need to talk, she said Baby just take my hand, and the tell me that you understand Let's talk about yesterdays, remembering when We still had that flame and we want it again That's just the way it is We need to talk, she saidWon't you please come to Paris , it's so beautiful in the Spring I'll bring you a wild flower and promise you everything I'll meet you on the Left Bank, where the street musicians sing Won't you please come to Paris , it's so beautiful in the spring Won't you please come to Paris, when it’s Summer nights are warm The sky's deep blue, and there's never a storm Whiskey colony of artist, we can Paint up until the morning Won't you please come to Paris, when it’s Summer nights are warm C'est la vie, c'est l'amour Voilà les femmes, c'est la geh That’s life, that’s love That’s women, that’s the way it goes Won't you please come to Paris, when the Autumn leaves are turning The colors are so beautiful, it's like the rainbow’s been burn There is a house in the countryside,  where The fate of love returns Won't you please come to Paris, when the Autumn leaves are turning Won't you please come to Paris, when the snow is on the ground There is children singing carols, and there is love all around Anytime is the right time, when the magic can be found Won't you please come to Paris, when the snow is on the groundToo many miles, in between us And two large stretch of bad roads Since you've been gone, I can't go on My life is out of control The days have no sunshine, or there be no rain I reach for you at night, and I call out your name I go ride out to Texas And when I find you in Texas It'll be you and me, in overdrive Having a wild Texas ride Wild Texas ride I'm crossing over, to your side baby I knew you were right all along Can't find nobody, wise like you baby I find it hard to go on The nights have no magic, without you by my side Can't see if you get started, and nothing goes right You and me side by side Wild Texas Ride You and me side by side Having a wild Texas Ride Wild Texas ride
