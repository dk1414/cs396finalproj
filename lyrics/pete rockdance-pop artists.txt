Thousands of years before Christ Tyrant Nimrod, Gilgamesh of Shinar, enslaved the first empire One world language, one world religion, one world order We have learned nothing Making the keys to heaven a gift to the devil Those who desire to supplant God Illuminati who tempt and horrify us as the most perfect angel Lucifer Seek to rebirth a new world order upon the flesh, blood, and bones of all humanity Again, towers rose skyward to challenge his divine glory To conquer his serene domain As in ancient Babylon, the one true Lord brought them down In 2001, three became naught, conspiracy is reality Fear is the weapon of thine enemy Acts of terror a lie, told to convince the meek to surrender to their rulers Atmospheric variances melt the polar ice caps and drown the rats who walk on two legs An incurable virus to decimate the dark, nuclear rain to set us aflame Obscured by a curtain of venom from space in the name of science Fall to your knees, pray to a last choking breath A new
