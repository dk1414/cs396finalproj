I don't want to wait anymore I'm tired of looking for answers Take me some place where there's music and there's laughter I don't know if I'm scared of dying But I'm scared of living too fast, too slow Regret, remorse, hold on, oh no I've got to go Thereâ€™s no starting over No new beginnings time races on And you've just gotta keep on keeping on Gotta keep on going Looking straight out on the road Can't worry 'bout what's behind you Or what's coming for you further up the road I try not to hold on to what is gone I try to do right what is wrong I try to keep on keeping on Yeah, I just keep on keeping on I hear a voice calling Calling out for me These shackles I've made in an attempt to be free Be it for reason, be it for love I won't take the easy road Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo Oh-oh Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo Oh-ohOh the bitter winds are coming in And I'm already missing the summer Stockholm's cold, but I've been told I was born to endure this kind of weather When it's you I find, like a ghost in my mind I am defeated and I gladly wear the crown I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June If you'll be my Gram and my Johnny too No, I'm not asking much of you Just sing, little darling, sing with me Now so much I know that things just don't grow If you don't bless them with your patience And I've been there before, I held up the door For every stranger with a promise But, I'm holding back, that's the strength that I lack Every morning keeps returning up my window And it brings me to you, and I won't just pass through But I'm not asking for a storm I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June If you'll be my Gram and my Johnny too No, I'm not asking much of you Just sing, little darling, sing with meI could've sworn I saw fireworks From your house last night As the lights flickered and they failed I had it all figured out Why do I do this to myself every time I know the way it ends before it's even begun I am the only one at the finish line I took a trip out to the frozen lake And you felt so far away But I could feel it washing over me There's no escaping the harsh light of day Why do I do this to myself every time I know the way it ends before it's even begun I am the only one at the finish line Stood out on that beach in Chicago Woke up next to you on Silver Lake Avenue Wherever I went I always knew, always knew Till I didn't knowLately I've been thinking about the past How there is no holding back No point in wasting sorrow On things that won't be here tomorrow But you and I well we don't need to speak It's the secret that we keep Out of view and out of sight Just say when and we'll say goodnight Tell me it's okay To live life this way Sometimes I want you to stay I know it's a shame Shame Shame Now I have spent so much of my time Going out of my mind Trying so hard to be of use But what you cannot gain you lose In L A, the sun's almost too bright I cannot get it right The emptiness I feel And now none of it seems realThe sun shone high those few summer days Left us in a soft, wide-eyed haze It shone like gold It shone like gold But just as the moon it shall stray So dawn goes down today No gold can stay No gold can stay What if our hard work ends in despair What if the road won't take me there Oh, I wish, for once We could stay gold What if to love and be loved's not enough What if I fall and can't bear to get up Oh, I wish, for once We could stay gold We could stay gold We're on our way through rugged land Top of that mountain we wanted to stand With hearts of gold With hearts of gold But there is only forward, no other way Tomorrow's your hope at the end of the day And gold turns grey And gold turns greyWolf mother, where you been You look so worn, so thin You're a taker, devil's maker Let me hear you sing, hey-ya, hey-ya Wolf father, at the door You don't smile anymore You're a drifter, a shapeshifter Let me see you run, hey-ya, hey-ya Holy light, oh, burn the night Oh, keep the spirits strong Watch it grow, child of woe, oh Keep holding on When I run through the deep dark forest long after this begun Where the sun would set, the trees were dead and the rivers were none And I hope for a trace to lead me back home from this place But there was no sound, there was only me and my disgrace Hey, hey-hey, hey, hey Hey, hey-hey, hey, hey Hey, hey-hey, hey, hey Hey, hey-hey, hey-yaYou told me once I have a rebel heart I don't know if that's true But I believe you saw something in me That lives inside you too Now all I hear is the wind There's a storm coming through Did I misplace or forsake my love Now that I gave it to you I don't know what it is That makes me run That makes me wanna shatter Everything that I've done Why do I keep dreaming of you Why do I keep dreaming of you Is it all because of my rebel heart Tell me what do you do I keep trying To be someone I'd never be I keep seeing her in everyone Everyone but me But I know you truly saw me Even if just for a while Maybe that's why it hurts now To leave it all behindI am so sick and tired of this world All these women with their dreams shattered From some man's sweaty, desperate touch God damn it, I've had enough When did you come to think refusal was sexy Can't you see the tears in her eyes How did you ever think you had the right to Put your entitled hands up her thighs You are the problem here You are the problem here No one made you do anything You are the problem here You are the problem here No one made you do anything And I And I hope you fucking suffer Do you really expect anyone to feel sorry That you ruined your own life You did it when you thought you had the right to Put your entitled hands up her thighs And we don't need to be diminished To sisters or daughters or mothers I am a human being, that is how you relate to meI wrote you a letter To make myself feel better To redeem some part of me I thought I had lost And we were a lost cause Long before we fell apart'Cause honey, I was too eager And you were too smart Yet I look for you In these empty rooms You're a phone call away I'm on the interstate And I've been drinking cheap wine Just to pass the time I'm falling behind And it doesn't matter Who you are to me Well I'm just like my mother We both love to run Chase impossible things Oh unreachable dreams I lie awake in the night Thinking this can't be right But there is no other way To live a life Alone I'm alone nowToday, I climb the highest mountain I have ever climbed And I turned to look at ruins I had left behind And you, where were you so far removed from any truth I lost you, didn't I First I think I lost myself Children, then and forever locked in a memory Holdin' that mirror searching for some kind of certainty That you were just the same as everyone But you were wrong And it hurt you, didn't it All you couldn't be Ruins Ooh Ruins Ooh I tried to hold on to some kind of dignity Too long I waded through a vast and endless sea Thinking I could find the secret there within But I gave up, didn't I It seemed the only way
