Oh I, I believe in magic and I believe in dreams Until I heard the thunder rumble I saw the mountains crumble Then came the circus so I followed its parade With all the fancy lion-tamers High-wire, fiery flamers Ravers of every kind I saw those high-steppin', sexy witches Sons of satin, sons of bitches All were there, in my dreams All in my dreams Sodom & Gomorrah, I see you're back in town And though you build a wall around you The multitude still found you Just like the circus to start with a parade Oh, but a parade of the fancy lion-tamers High-wire, fiery flamers Ravers of every kind With all those high-steppin', sexy witches Sons of satin, sons of bitches All were there, in my dreams All in my dreamsSometimes it's easy to believe it Sound may be the warmest thing he's found He just starts playing, then he says to me:"Ready your body for love, there is no gravity here Look up - the roof is gone and the long hand moves Right on by the hour Look up - the roof is gone The roof is gone, the roof is gone La musica de espana es para mi como Ia libertad Canta como si la libertad es suiyo Convenir resuena para escapar Escuche viento norte escuche Como corneta nevada corneta cantar Alrededor vient oriente vient oriente Enroyar disenroyar Querdas que gritan Querdas que cantan Spanish wind keeps telling me How it feels to sing free It keeps blowing on me, and it s showing me Another way, another way to listen And if you hear, if you hear the wind singing like Someone singing for your love The more it sings the more you know Horns and strings and time will show you Show - show you, show you freedomGegan El Diablo I can feel your power in my soul Dancing like your puppet though I try to break your hold Half succeeding still I find I'm healing quickly You'll not trick me one more time El Diablo you are like a fountain blowing dust Peddler of delusion, dire confusion and disgust As you hook your mark with joyous heart you up the price Take your pleasure elsewhere cast your gaze not on my life El Diablo I can feel your power in my soul Dancing like your puppet though I try to break your hold Half succeeding still I find I'm healing quickly You'll not trick me one more time El Diablo I can hear you calling in the night Pass me by in silence I'll not follow you tonight Beat your breast like thunder vent your anger with a howl You'll not pull me under I'll not tremble at your growlShe's been living too high trying to get to heaven at night They all knew she was bound to go down 'way before she fell They all know how it feels to try and hold on to the light They know the darkness of the night sky so well But there's just no way to tell her She'll do it the hard way She's gonna break right through the sign that says This is the end of the ride She'll do it the hard way She's gonna shake the hands of time and try to Turn back the tide She'll do it the hard way She's gonna take whatever she can find until there's No one by her side And there's no place left to hide She said I'm gonna get more out of living every day She said I know how to get more out of life if I just had more time If I can just keep on taking when someone else is giving it away That way the sweet life - That'll be all mine in no time But there's just no more time for herToo much of life has fallen through my hands I pray the lord I get another chance To face the raging storm and test it's hands Face to the wind Too many hours making future plans Afraid to gaze upon the dealer's hand But you know he's due to call so make your stand Face to the wind, Face to the wind Like a boat upon the river swept drifting out to sea I cast my fate to the wind And the storm hangs like a dagger to cut me in the heart But still I stand Face to the wind Face to the wind Face to the wind Face to the wind There's a guiding light, a lantern burning bright To light my way And a demon daring me to look him in the eye Straight in the eye Straight in the eye Like a boat upon the river swept drifting out to sea I cast my fate to the wind And the storm hangs like a dagger to cut me in the heart But still I stand Face to the wind Face to the wind Face to the windCheaters -

Don't look too far, you can find it everywhere You can lose it without a warning If you grab on too tight Try to read too much into it You know it's only music That song - the one your hear inside late at night It can set you reeling That song, that song is just your own Heart beating, but it can sound like a symphony You hear a voice so clear you can't tell what its saying Well maybe you now that tune you hear Might never end I thought that I heard you singing at night You know I had the feeling That I, I have known that song Way beyond this life without beginning Who knows the name of that song Go broke and come back singing Since the world appeared Get write it down Cos it doesn't spell It doesn't end In the still, the still of the night When the wind is quiet Quiet and still I sit inside, the empty room Waiting hear the tune that Comes stealing through the mazes - writ on empty pages
