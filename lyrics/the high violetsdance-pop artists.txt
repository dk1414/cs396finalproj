I can't afford to let you get away I never seem to decide Two by four you watch as I parade Another batch of clowns Patiently holding on Bitter sweet you and I We can't say our goodbyes Cause our old love never dies And others pay with hearts broken wide And we try really try But free's a word that terrifies Cause our old love never dies Every time we try to say goodbye It's just goodnight Kids we stayed that day back when We met and you were only 24 There's no reward for our get away Strung up by guilt til dawn Holding on Holding on and onLove you in the sun In the ocean Our time there Went too fast Wish it would never end But all things do All good things Love in your car We'll listen to some B-sides Besides we have no place Place to be When you're next to me My heart sighs brightly La la la la la la. Reason falls away With my Sun Baby And you do know, you know, you do know You do know, you know, you do know My love never strays They all want to lay With my Sun Baby And you do know, you know, you do know You do know, you know, you do know My love completes me Barely breathing Will you take me oh so highJulia your eyes have seen the darker side of life But smile a while before you say goodbye Your eyes have seen the darker side of life But laugh a while before you say...Julia you look like the ocean way So stay a while and look at the sun Your eyes seem an ocean away But come back and stay a while101 curves Nothing particular There's no design Run to the white There's no design White lines crash Stay..  look at me fast There's no design Run to the white There's no designHold me all night Safe here all night I dream away, I dream away I dream away, I dream away Hold me all night Safe here all night I dream away, I dream away I dream away, I dream away Hold me all night Safe here all night To be right here beside you That what's it takes for you to get to my soul Oh dream away, oh dream away Hold me all night Safe here all nightCan you feel that love it is blinding He can't see anyone but her She flew away long ago with the band and a model Still he thinks he can win back her love Too high, you are too blind You don't have to hold my hand I understand he said then added this thought Her life is stormy and fame's left her lonely Without me it's all shallow and dark Too high You are too blind Keep that soul alive Where there's truth you'll hide Too high You are too blind You are...You are to blindLove Wake up Do the stuff we make up Love We lay for weeks Hands clasped grasping Love, ante up Love, raise your hand Hearts are our cards Drunk with our luck Realise, one day ?? You have the stormiest eyes to break The hearts, of all who’d fall Won’t you call But don’t you break my heart There was calm before my fall He’s going to break another heart These days, I ache, until my body shakes Alone, waiting by the phone Won’t you call But don’t you break my heart There is calm before a storm Before he breaks another heart This can’t be happening A promise made to nothing As if he’s half asleep It’s day to night He’s gone to break another heart Somehow, I Have to mend This heart of mineI’ll be there I'll be home Won’t be scared to sleep or think I’ll die alone When you look for me Playing hide and seek I took the stairs Lion Hearted Look I’m under cement To be your darling Hiding under the stairs Find oh find me Can I look the same to you darling Fools in love don’t care Fool for your company Two of us will fall asleep Fools in love don’t care Lion Hearted Look I’m under cement To be your kingdom Hiding under the stairs Find  oh find me
