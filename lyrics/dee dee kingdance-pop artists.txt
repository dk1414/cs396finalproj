serenade About a Brooklyn babe How can I describe the chick Let's do some arithmetic She's a 34-23-34 A killer on the dance floor Skin-tight jeans, and at fourteen She was seeing a Marine Don't underestimate her She's as hot as a pepper She don't do the wash Don't do the cookin'She don't have to'Cause she's good lookin'She don't like To go steady'Cause she knows She ain't ready To get married and settle down'Cause it's so much fun to run aroundDon't take away her whiskey Don't take away her rye She'll show her fangs And spit in your eye Poor little rich girl A hopeless case Everything she does Is in bad taste You can find her On your favorite bar stool Drinkin' with the guys An old drunken fool She goes to the local Five and dime To buy her makeup And drink her wine Oh She's a poor little rich girl She's a poor little rich girl She's a poor little rich girl A run in her stocking A lopsided wig She laughs to herself As she takes another swig The story goes on She couldn't get worse This, chick Keeps a bottle in her purseToo much to drink Too much to drink For a minute there I thought I had writers' block And I'd be taking my jewelry To the pawn shop I was so distressed My life was a mess I needed a new rap Baby Doll was in the nest Max was being Oh so quiet There was tension in the house He couldn't hide it I was sitting there Thinking of a caper But no new rhymes Appeared on the paper I was get-tin' real ed-gy Then the Devil said"Yo, Dee Dee Why don't you Have a little drink It might help You to think It might make a new rap Come into your head Baby
