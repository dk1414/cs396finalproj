If you like to gamble, I tell you I'm your man You win some, lose some, it's all the same to me The pleasure is to play, it makes no difference what you say I don't share your greed, the only card I need is The Ace of Spades The Ace of Spades Playing for the high one, dancing with the devil Going with the flow, it's all a game to me Seven or Eleven, snake eyes watching you Double up or quit, double stake or split The Ace of Spades The Ace of Spades You know I'm born to lose, and gambling's for fools But that's the way I like it, baby, I don't wanna live forever And don't forget the joker I, I will be king And you, shall be my queen Though nothing, will never drive them away But we can beat them, forever and ever Cause we can be heroes, just for one day And you, you are insane And I, I am the same Cause we're lovers, and that is the truth Yes we're lovers, and we are the proof Though nothing, will keep us together We could stop time, forever and ever We can be heroes What d'you say I, I can remember Standing, by the wall And the guns, were all ready to fire And we kissed, as though we never can fall And the shame, was on another city Oh we can beat them, forever and ever Then we could be heroes, just for one day We can be heroes, we can be heroes We can be heroes, just for one day We can be heroesOnly way to feel the noise Is when it's good and loud So good I can't believe it

fun Have another stick of gum Man, you look better alreadyIf the stars fall down on me And the sun refused to shine Then may the shackles be undone May all the old words cease to rhyme If the sky turned into stone It will matter not at all For there is no heaven in the sky Hell does not wait for our downfall Let the voice of reason chime Let the pious vanish for all time God's face is hidden, all unseen You can't ask Him what it all means He was never on your side God was never on your side Let right or wrong alone decide God was never on your side See ten thousand ministries See the holy, righteous dogs They claim to heal, but all they do is steal Abuse your faith, cheat, and rob If God is wise, why is He still When these false prophets call Him friend Why is He silent  Is He blind Are

your lips No fooling, I can see you drooling Feel the hunger grow16 years old when I went to the war To fight for a land fit for heroes God on my side, and a gun in my hand Chasing my days down to zero And I marched and I fought and I bled And I died & I never did get any older But I knew at the time, That a year in the line Was a long enough life for a soldier We all volunteered And we wrote down our names And we added two years to our ages Eager for life and ahead of the game Ready for history's pages And we brawled and we fought And we whored 'til we stood Ten thousand shoulder to shoulder A thirst for the Hun We were food for the gun And that's what you are when you're soldiers I heard my friend cry And he sank to his knees, coughing blood As he screamed for his mother And I fell by his side And that's how he died Clinging like kids to each other And I lay in the mud And the guts and the blood And I wept as his body grew colder And I called for my mother And she never came Though it wasn't my fault And I wasn't to blame The day not half over And ten thousand slain, and now There's nobody remembers our names And that's how it is for a soldierWell here babe, look at you In love with someone else Turned out like all the others Leave me by myself That's how it works I guess And you like all the rest Guess I can handle it If that's the way it is I'm in love with rock 'n' roll It satisfies my soul That's how it has to be, I won't get mad I got rock 'n' roll to save me from the cold And if that's all there is, it ain't so bad Rock 'n' roll I never been the one to have no steady girl I love the way I live, running around the world I like to fool around, I love to tear 'em down And when I leave, you love to miss me When I'm gone I got rock 'n' roll It satisfies my soul That's how it has to be, I won't get mad I got rock 'n' roll to save me from the cold And if that's all there is, it ain't so bad Rock 'n' rollLove me forever or not at all End of our tether, backs to the wall Give me your hand, don't you ever ask why Promise me nothing, live 'till we die Everything changes, it all stays the same Everyone guilty, no-one to blame Every way out brings you back to the start Everyone dies to break somebody's heart We are the system, we are the law We are corruption, worm in the core One of another, laugh 'till you cry Faith unto death or a knife in your eye Everything changes, it all stays the same Everyone guilty, no-one to blame Every way out takes you back to the start Everyone dies to break somebody's heart Oh, my lost love, come on back to me
