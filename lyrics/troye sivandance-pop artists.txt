I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs Tired of love songs, tired of love Just wanna go home, wanna go home Wanna go home, woah So tired of love songs, tired of love songs Tired of love songs, tired of love Just wanna go home, wanna go home Wanna go home, woah Party, trying my best to meet somebody But everybody around me is falling in love to our song I, I, oh I, yeah Hate it, taking a shot 'cause I can't take it But I don't think that they make anything that strong, so I hold on I, I, oh I, yeah I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs Tired of love songs, tired of love Just wanna go home, wanna go home Wanna go home, woah So tired of love songs, tired of love songs Tired of love songs, tired of love Just wanna go home, wanna go home Wanna go home, woahWhat if, what if we run away What if, what if we left today What if we said goodbye to safe and sound And what if, what if we're hard to find What if, what if we lost our minds What if we let them fall behind and they're never found And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth And the stars exploding, we’ll be fireproof My youth, my youth is yours Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls My youth, my youth is yours Runaway now and forevermore My youth, my youth is yours A truth so loud you can't ignore My youth, my youth, my youth My youth is yours What if, what if we start to drive What if, what if we close our eyes What if we're speeding through red lights into paradise Cause we've no time for getting old Mortal body; timeless souls Cross your fingers, here we goI woke up pissed off today And lately, everyone feels fake Somewhere, I lost a piece of me Smoking cigarettes on balconies But I can't do this alone Sometimes I just need a light If I call you on the phone Need you on the other side So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river I'll be there for you I'll be there for you When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper I'll be loud for you But you gotta be there for me too But you gotta be there for me too Last year took a toll on me But I made it with you next to me Around the world and back again I hope you're waiting at the endTake a trip into my garden I've got so much to show ya The fountains and the waters Are begging just to know ya And it's true, baby I've been saving this for you, baby I guess it's something like a fun fair Put gas into the motor And boy I'll meet you right there We'll ride the rollercoaster'Cause it's true, baby I've been saving this for you, baby I need you to Tell me right before it goes down Promise me you'll Hold my hand if I get scared now Might tell you to Take a second, baby, slow it down You should know I, you should know IShine on, diamond Don't make me wait another day'Cause passion is passion You know it just as well as me Now, let's stop running from love Running from love Let's stop, my baby Let's stop running from us Running from us Let's stop, my baby Oh my, my, my I die every night with you Oh my, my, my Living for your every move Spark up, buzz cut I got my tongue between your teeth Go slow, no, no, go fast You like it just as much as meI am tired of this place, I hope people change I need time to replace what I gave away And my hopes, they are high, I must keep them small Though I try to resist I still want it all I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes I see a little house on the hill and children’s names I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray But everything is shattering and it’s my mistake Only fools fall for you, only fools Only fools do what I do, only fools fall Only fools fall for you, only fools Only fools do what I do, only fools fall Oh, our lives don’t collide, I’m aware of this We've got differences and impulses and your obsession with The little things you like stick, and I like aerosol I don’t give a fuck, I'm not giving up, I still want it all Only fools fall for you, only fools Only fools do what I do, only fools fall Only fools fall for you, only fools Only fools do what I do, only fools fallI got the good side of things Left you with both of the rings My fingers danced and swayed in the breeze The change in the wind took you down to your knees I got the good side of you Send it out into the blue The people danced to the sound of your heart The world sang along to it falling apart But I sympathize, and I recognize And baby, I apologize That I got the good side The good side of things I got the good side of life Travelled the universe twice So many thoughts I wanted to share But I didn't call because it wouldn't be fair Then I got the good side of new Found arms to fall right into I know how it looked, it wasn't the plan And some day I hope that you'll understandYoung ambition Say we'll go slow, but we never do Premonition See me spendin’ every night with you Oh, yeah, under the kitchen lights You still look like dynamite And I wanna end up on you Oh, don't need no place to go Just put on the radio You know what I wanna do We can just dance to this Don't take much to start me We can just dance to this Push up on my body, yeah You know we’ve already seen all of the parties We can just dance to this We can just, we can just Dance to this Dance to this We can just dance to thisYou ran away to find something to say I went astray to make it okay And he made it easy, darlin'I'm still in love, and I say that because I know how it seems between you and me It hasn't been easy, darlin'I can't even look at you Would you look at the space just next to your feet The wood is warping The lines distorting This house is on fire, woo!Burning the tears right off my face What the hell did we do Tell me we'll make it through'Cause he made it easy, easy Please, don't leave me, leave me What's left of the dance The smell on my hands The rock in my throat, a hair on my coat The stranger at home, my darling Now I'm vulnerable, so sad and alone But don't cry for me, 'cause everyone knows You reap what you sow, my darling Yeah, yeah, yeahRemember when we first met You said, "Light my cigarette"So I lied to my mum and dad I jumped the fence and I ran But we couldn't go very far'Cause you locked your keys in your car So you sat and stared at my lips And I could already feel your kiss Long nights, daydreams Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you Headlights on me Racing to 60, I've been a fool Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like Blue eyes, black jeans Lighters and candy, I've been a fool But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you Remember when you taught me fate Said it'd all be worth the wait Like that night in the back of the cab When your fingers walked in my hand Next day, nothin' on my phone But I can still smell you on my clothes Always hoping that things would change But we went right back to your games
