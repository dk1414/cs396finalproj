Song about a sunbeam Song about a girl Your voice still rings and echoes in my mind So many words unspoken So many worlds apart Your memory is all you left behind Somewhere it all got crazy And now it's like a dream And I knew that I blew it from the start Too freaked out to deal with it all And too fucked up to care I stood right there and watched it fall apart Now L SD and Ecstasy don't help me And my dance with Mr  Brownstone got too rough Will you wake me without warning Some jingle-jangle morning We'll fly away to heaven on a star'Cause I love to watch you walk And I love to hear you talk But there's nothing I can say To make you feel the same wayI’ve seen you watching Her every time she crosses the floor So won’t you just go and talk to The one you really adore I’m getting pretty used to being The one that you always ignore When somebody wants you I’ve seen it before You’re every kind of collar There ain’t nothing that you won’t claim Your ambition and promise And your addiction to fame And everyone’s got a dollar Sign after their name When somebody wants you You treat ’em just the same So go on and pick up You don’t care what poison you choose And what person you lose It should’ve been me, yeah Shouldn’t it be I don’t think I fit into his indie world Guided By Voices and Velocity Girl Eric’s Trip and Rocketship Rancid and Rocket from The Crypt Bikini Kill and Built to Spill, it’s plain to see that I don’t fit He says my songs are too deep and gloomy He wishes that I could be more like Jenny Toomey Just give me my Joni, my Nick, Neil, and Bob You can keep your Tsunami, your Slant 6 and Smog What’s the story He says Butterglory I say: what’s the news He says the Silver Jews His Heavenly hang-up is getting me down And it’s making me wonder why he’s hanging around'Cause I don’t fit into his indie scene Huggy Bear and Helium and Half Japanese Sebadoh and Sentridoh and Superchunk and I don’t know Doug and Lou and Calvin too and Kim and Kim and Kim and Kim Yeah I’m stuck in the past and he’s stuck on his four-track But I can’t get through to his one-track mind I push play and record and a major chord Maybe I’ll win his heart this time Maybe I’ll win his heart this timeThe knees are bent and the hands are clasped The painted head is bowed A sudden glimpse through heaven’s gate Is all that I'm allowed My hair is black and my eyes are green But Marie is not my name Na, na, na-na, na, na, na-na, na His lamest flame His lamest flame will be Too brief and burn too pale And all attempts to fire it up again will fail I run around behind his friends And play the waiting game Na, na, na-na, na, na, na-na, na His lamest flame I tell myself a million times there’s nothing I can do So why do I keep holding on I only wish I knew I was born too weak and I feel like a fool But he's out of my domainMhm, okay This song is called Look, I'm out of breath Now, this one's called "Camden Town Rain"She's pretty on the inside She's pretty on the outside I hope she's got the heart to back it up She's got a whole, whole lot of style She's got everything I lack She stole my dawn before my day began Let her keep it, I don't want it back She's your sister, you're her brother Couldn't ask for any other She's your best friend and your lover She don't fade She's got your smile in her locket As she's walking through the Camden Town rain She's easy to look at But still so hard to see Snow-white tan, she'll bitch at her fans In a dress from Agnes B And I was sleeping on some bus While she was sleeping in your arms She got Four Seasons and Hyatts While I got a daybreak view from a Greyhound Oh, but if east is east and west is west I double dare you, don't confess The Heaven's shoe he promised you Is often less than what you get And what you might have expectedDisappearing out of sight Along the open road Into interstate horizons I had no time to be loved Like a silver bullet from a gun An arrow from a bow Like an equine star You hear about me everywhere you go All through nebula I was racing in my mind I tripped on the light fantastic And I've never looked behind You slow down You slow down My lights are changing You slow down You slow down Our lights are changing You fly so high, yeah, and you move so fast You're running blindly from the past Slow down You slow down Green lights are changingThere was a corner It was the place to go We used to meet there Doing our whiz and blow I had a friend there She was a waste of space She tried to match me She couldn't stay the pace She was a no one She was a loser She had you She had you She had you She had you I couldn't stand it Seeing you there with her I never told you How much it really hurt I went to college I got a fancy car Drop dead apartment Now I'm a shining star But she never made it She's selling AvonLook at me laughing Look at me joking I'm having such fun, oh And look at me screaming Look at me choking I've been overcome And look at me hang from your windowsill And look at me stand on the top of your hill My voice rang out like a dentist's drill And the wind blew all around me Look at me dancing Look at me dying My muscles have shook me Look at me sleeping Look at me flying Way out of my body Look at my plane Should we go for a spin And look at the kids asking where we've been You took the controls and I stood on the wing And the wind blew all around me All around All around All around All around YeahI felt a little uneasy on easy street Out of place and incomplete call it guilt Call it what you will Kissed good-bye the summer sky Hollywood and Malibu tides Through thick and thin you got a Good friend in me Just give me a beer and give me a bed Chase the demons out of my head Play me a song and sing me to sleep And meet me in the middle of my dreams Well I’ve seen the sun rise from the cliffs at Point Reyes And I’ve see it set upon Thunder Bay But I always keep my compass set on you When the night comes in and the stars come out And the highway lines start to wear me out It’ll be ok cause I’m coming back home to you Distant salutations and silly souvenirs Can’t help your twilight loneliness So brush away your tears I’ll wire you some love today There’s so much more I want to say But I’m Western Union desperate In a pay phone in the rain And it’s so insane I’m Rimbaud and you’re VerlaineWith your sunspot stopwatch, renegade savior stances You said take your chances Or else you break your branches as you climb To that top-shelf tuna melt buckle up your seat belt, Rickie Lee Jones And everything you think you own Is fools gold and ancient fossils stones You got more than you need but you need a lot more than some do Look at your cigarette burn, friend The things that you can't undo if you tried Well that's tough luck, chicken butt, Daffy Duck never got old babe They'll bury you with gold yay If that's enough to hold you for today And I've gotta hand it to you Why you do what you do It's times like this I'm glad that I ain't you You think you've got the devil on retreat But he's back up on his feet and he's lookin' for you With your monkey wrench and dig a trench And don't you see the lights are very shinin'Shut up and quit your whinin'Four-star restaurants, dinin' in the shade Well then your miniskirt'll hit the dirt And baby you'll be crying and bleeding You'll bite the hand that's feedin'And you'll be back and you'll be pleadin' for your soul
