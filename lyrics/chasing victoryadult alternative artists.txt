It would take an army of angels To restore her health back to herself Her heart belongs to another A boy whose mystery exaggerates She won't be hard to save So where's the show somebody's gotta know We're coming out tonight When her car goes up in flames We'll find a way to take away her pain Don't kill the fire, just kill the girl We'll sort this out when you get back Don't let her go Who picked her up in the ambulance Who picked her upLate into the drinks I toss back All the colors fade to black and she comes into view I'm standing still My back's against the cage But don't you be afraid I'm not here against me will And she haunts me She taunts my soul She's everywhere I go, calling me home She wants me to want control She sings in foreign tongues only I would know Inside my head, I can't shake this vision of familiar face And she comes into view Ball and chain It's magnetizing, so inviting I don't ever want to be cut loose And she haunts me She taunts my soul She's everywhere I go, calling me home She wants me to want control She sings in foreign tongues only I would knowI've been writing words that mean a bit of nothing Just to sing it loud and cash in deeds for fame I won't put a finger out the door Until I've spilled my guts on paper And feel it so meaningful So sing with me if you know the words I've got a feeling I've used this phrase before When it goes into the verse Then I throw hands over to the crowds Not a single word is moving But tonight I'm breaking ground I'm looking for an open door when it's over You know it's over I've gotta find a sign or a way to pull myself together Before I walk up there tonight Or I'll be sitting up so late with my face in My hands and tears in my eyes screaming is it over I've been plotting this escape Not thinking of the consequences of my mistakes I just want to be found, then get lost in you I'm walking through the city of the dead I'm thinking of the words that I should have said The world has chewed me up and spit me out the end of it's tongue When the wolves licked their lips I could've swore they were falling in love I've got the remedy for you Throw out those medicines you normally consume I've got the remedy for you No needles and blood and swallowing tongues Oh, brother, we're falling in love So brace yourself We're cleaning you out of all your sickly addictions So pace yourself The clock is freaking you out and tearing you downWeighed down like vultures circling the dead Pulling apart and embracing the life in the depths of this man Pulling teeth with sharpened beaks from the stones Raise your glass for the end is near Raise your glass to a life of fear The ghost is closing in on me What's the price of admission  No Gimmicks for one minute The ghost is closing in on me What's the price of admission  No Gimmicks for one minute You're building a circus, a haven To shelter your deepest secrets and your darkest demons You're feeding a monster, but enough is enough You've taken this too far and I don't know who you are The ghost is closing in on me What's the price of admission  No gimmicks for one minute The ghost is closing in on me What's the price of admission  No gimmicks for one minute You fall in love to feel part of the crowd You fall asleep to dream about yourself away from help All we have is who we are to someone else All we are is what we have when we're away from helpAnd I gave my tongue The way to want to see These may be buried alive Oh brothers and sisters Don't cast out your nets so thin To choke the lies Be careful of the damage you cause Oh brothers and sisters Don't you know That to live by fear Is to grow to disbelief And love will always be the greatest of these It could change the world's Opinion of us If we could love We could take the worst Opinion of us And change it with love So just close your eyes Know that their lives Missed the love of lifeI've been feeling kind of sick to my stomach It's just a gimmick but the kids seem to love it And if you're patient you can witness the sell-out I'm not a killer but Hollywood's gonna drown And if you're feeling original Don't let it go to your head It's all been done before You're not the first one You're not the first one And there's a rumor creeping into my ears That we've been changing how our image appears And I'll be the first one, not the last one To tell you images in mirrors aren't as big as you hear Until those who doubt A bitter taste lingering in my mouth I'm not a trophy, I'm just a show fiend Hold out your hand now baby close your eyes I'm gonna take you on a journey tonight They say I'm addicted to the spotlight I've got a feeling they may be right Hold out your hand now baby close your eyes I'll take you on a journey if the feeling's right They say I'm addicted to the spotlight I've got a feeling they may be rightSeparated, I cut myself clean From a past that comes back in my darkest of dreams Been apprehended by a spiritual force And a grace that replaced all the me I've divorced I saw a man with tat on his big fat belly It wiggled around like marmalade jelly It took me a while to catch what it said Cause I had to match the rhythm of his belly with my head'Jesus Saves' is what it raved in a typical tattoo green He stood on a box in the middle of the city And claimed he had a dream What will people think When they hear that I'm a Jesus freak What will people do when they find that it's true I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak There ain't no disguising the truth Kamikaze, my death is gain I've been marked by my Maker A peculiar display The high and lofty, they see me as weak Cause I won't live and die for the power they seek There was a man from the desert with naps in his head The sand that he walked was also his bed The words that he spoke made the people assume There wasn't too much left in the upper room With skins on his back and hair on his face They thought he was strange by the locusts he ate The Pharisees tripped when they heard him speak Until the king took the head of this Jesus freakI don't really understand Why I'm feeling so disappointed With the images inside my head They enter so undetected But I'd never hurt a single soul My pulse is beating even faster When your words speak so bold I am learning not to speak, yet to listen I am learning that if I Choose to speak at all, speak easy I'm coming to the conclusion That healing works best Through silent bruising So just be patient for all you're losing Love is patient, love is kindThere's blood on my hands and there's blood on the ground and we're dying just to see who the next victim of our disaster will  If only you would just accept him  We'll never be alive until we open up our eyes  Step into the light  Your burning my eyes and I'm paralyzed by you  Step into the light  And it's goodnight to you and the accused  The sky up above is burning with red  Everyone can plainly see we were never dead we were searching for a contagious disease  I guess we'll never understand it  We'll never be alive until open up our eyes  How could this happen to me  I never burned this city down  It's always been somebody else's fault, but I know this much .  you won't last it through the night  I know this much .  you won't last me through the night
