glamour, just want to put these lyrics on camera, listen I'm like the council estates that I lived in I got stories, running from the top floor straight to the ground floor To the bus stop then I hopped out the bus to the Morley's Parents call me, well I air them calls cause I didn't wanna hear them war me I was in a ignorant state of mind, behaving poor, all night poorly I was in a middle class school but I know for a fact that my parents didn't vote Tory Came on straight and bounce, fuck that way man I wanna get pounds Never gave weed any of my attention, never even gave it an ounce I put my hand in one or two baskets, then I went and got a slam dunk in the council When I say grimy, I don't mean skates and boards, I don't mean weights and doors Everybody break some laws, yeah I should have been staying indoors Instead of me playing with fraud But I could have been worse, it could have been worse I could've cared 'bout hood status Kept that grime from funky house, I should really have a migraine now Good gracious Hood famous, now I wanna get paid though No questions no I smoke for the radio I just wanna get to the top like Kano I don't care if that thot's got a halo Man ain't gonna wife that, or get sidetracked Cause they send 100 emojis I just sent them a 100 emoji Cause they only give a fuck when they lonely, fuck 'em They weren't there on my nights in black Hope that song has a right impact Fans want grime so I might detract regardless I'm gonna put my life in tracks I'm writing, so I'm not writing back Go take time for your writing cats If it's H-A-R-D then
