Livin' my life in a slow hell Different girl every night at the hotel I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whiskey Wish I had a good girl to miss me Lord, I wonder if I'll ever change my ways I put your picture away Sat down and cried today I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her I put your picture away Sat down and cried today I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her I called you last night in the hotel Everyone knows, but they won't tell But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right I've been waitin' on you for a long time Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine I ain't heard from you in three damn nights I put your picture away I wonder where you've been I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him I put your picture away I wonder where you've been I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long Caught somewhere between a boy and man She was seventeen and she was far from in-between It was summertime in Northern Michigan Ah ah ah Ah ah ah Splashing through the sand bar Talking by the campfire It's the simple things in life, like when and where We didn't have no internet But man, I never will forget The way the moonlight shined upon her hair And we were trying different things We were smoking funny things Making love out by the lake to our favorite song Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long Catching walleye from the dock Watching the waves roll off the rocks She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul We'd blister in the sun We couldn't wait for night to come To hit that sand and play some rock and rollCowboy Cowboy Well I'm packin' up my game and I'ma head out west Where real women come equipped with scripts and fake breasts Find a nest in the Hills, chill like Flynt Buy an old drop-top find a spot to pimp And I'ma Kid Rock it up and down ya' block With a bottle of scotch and watch lots a crotch Buy a yacht with a flag sayin' "Chillin' the Most"Then rock that bitch up and down the coast Give a toast to the sun, drink with the stars Get thrown in the mix and tossed outta bars Sip the Tiajuana, I want to roam Find Motown, tell them fools to come back home Start an escort service for all the right reasons And set up shop at the top of Four Seasons Kid Rock and I'm the real Mc Coy And I'm headed out west sucker because I wanna be a Cowboy, baby!With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'Cowboy, baby!West Coast chillin' with the Boone's wine I wanna be a Cowboy, baby!Ridein' at night 'cause I sleep all day!Cowboy, baby!I can smell a pig from a mile away{Fading in}Bawitdaba, da bang, da dang
