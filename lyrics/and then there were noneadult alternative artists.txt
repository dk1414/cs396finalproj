Closing doorways as you're building a fire Watching lies received as you silently conspire"This is a heart attack and I want my life back"We can take this, if we fake this, if we try Oh, everybody wants you and you know That they won't be alive to take you home They found me now And I don't think you understand That I was lost I was lost And I had no place to go But I don't think you'd understand Taking chances or just breathing in vain The four lives lost at cost were Twenty times less worth your name This is a heart attack and you want your life back I can take this, if I fake this, if they die And you want what you can't change But your selfish pride will take The lives of others you could saveIf both our lives pulled us apart and we were stuck on both coasts I would still find you Every night you’d fall asleep and I would meet you in your dreams Three thousand miles away It’s not perfection but we’ve come so far Tell me now, tell me you believe again Well, I can see you when I close my eyes It’s complicated, but I’ll make it that simple Your pictures are the paper that lines my wall I’m waiting for the moment you come back I’m tearing out the pages of my heart What you need is what you’ll get from me Your pictures are the paper that lines my wall I’m waiting for the moment you come back I’m tearing out the pages of my heart What you need is what you’ll get from me Not at the end of the road, I’ll be with you each day Every step of the way I know it’s late, this took too long, but I would write you this song Now could you listen to me If not for moments, what’s this life we lead Tell me now, Jamie, tell me you believe Three thousand miles is not that far It’s complicated but I’ll make it that simpleLike a thunderstorm that pulls you deep into the night She speaks to me in numbers and is gone when I open my eyes You know I’ll just forget it if you give me a chance I can’t desire something if it just isn’t there She’s in my blood like a fire inside me Consumes the air then leads me blindly She has my hopes and dreams And she’s the one I see who screams "go on, go on"She doesn’t know who I am I really want to tell her that this can’t go on tonight She’s in my blood, in like a broken glass Take one last breath and she’ll leave you bruised tonight She was calling, I kept waiting by the phone She looked at me with her left eye closed and said"You don’t know"You know I’ll just forget it if you give me a chance You can’t desire something if it just isn’t thereControlled by fear we see the light, the pain Desire brings as your heart subsides Brake away these five promises of love We are torn apart in sorrow No stopping now Will you shape the broken pieces No stopping now No stopping now Your heart subsides Is love worth dying for View this life unending emotion Brake away these five promises Promises of loveClosing doorways as you're building a fire Watching lies received as you silently conspire"This is a heart attack and I
