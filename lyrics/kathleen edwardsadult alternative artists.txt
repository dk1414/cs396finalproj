You know what I wish It was just you and me Sitting in this corner bar You can tell me how you are I'm not going to lie or anything You don't even have to speak If you keep looking at me I could go all night But they're turning up the lights It would be so easy To do or say anything And I'm not going to lie I'm not looking for love I won't let you in my heart But you are always on my mindBlazing a trail to the southern cities From the streets of our hometown Basement bars we played from the heart In the company of our friends If I write down these memories That I have saved away Photographs of the years that passed Inside my little brain You're cool and cred like Fogerty I'm Elvis Presley in the '70s You're Chateauneuf, I'm Yellow Label You're the buffet, I'm just the table I'm a Ford Tempo, you're a Maserati You're the Great One, I'm Marty Mc Sorley You're the Concorde, I'm economy I make the dough, but you get the glory Big fish small pond and some cover songs That we sang along the way We used to midnight run to the Vesta Lunch Cheeseburgers and chocolate shakes Once I got drunk with Jeff I told him I was in love with you But I love you like a brother So I guess half of it was trueEverything in this house breaks What wouldn't under the weight Everything in this house goes away You're going to fix it, or so you say Everything in this house wants to breathe The words that get twisted up when you speak There's something to be said about being strong Well there's something to be said about never being wrong And you're so hard on me Why would you want to be Am I not the one you love You're so hard on everyone You're so hard on me Why would I let you be Am I not the one you love You're so hard on everyone Everything in this house is afraid What wouldn't be, under your weight I believed all the things you claim to know And then you treat me like a lie that you use when you lose control And everything in this house goes away A storyline that was bound to break'Cause you can't wrap it up with a pretty bow And then take your gifts back when all the cracks start to showCalling it quits, you think this is easy I swear I heard you calling the jury Call it a catch without any strings attached Well, I'm looking for a soft place to land The forest floor, the palms of your hands I'm looking for a soft place to land I call it an ace, you've gotta believe me But you're calling me names and not to my face But you're calling my spade a bluff without calling it love I'm looking for a soft place to land The forest floor, the palms of your hands I'm looking for a soft place to land Call me in the night, I don't mind I don't care, I can't sleep Call me in the day, in my car on my way Call me by name, all I want is to hear you say I'm looking for a soft place to land The forest floor, the palms of your hands I'm looking for a soft place to land The forest floor, the palms of your hands Palms of your handsMy love took a ride on a red-eye plane Going home and we're never going to feel the same Change this feeling under my feet Change the sheets and then change me My love is a stockpile of broken wills Like Santa Fe, margaritas, and sleeping pills I want to lie in the cracks of this lonely road I can fill in the blanks every time you don't phone Here is the truth, I swear it used to be fun Go ahead run, run, run, run Change this feeling under my feet Change the sheets and then change me Won't you change this feeling under my feet I want to lie in the cracks of this lonely road I can fill in the blanks every time you don't phone Here is the truth, I swear it was fun Go ahead run, run, run, run, run, run, run Change this feeling under my feet Would you change the sheets and then change me Change this feeling under my feet'Cause here is the truth, I swear it was fun Go ahead run, run, run, run, run, run, ooh Go ahead run, run, run, run, run, run, oohIt's complicated, technically I'm certified A walking declaration of everything I couldn't get right Time is just an anchor, but seven years I think I'm right And now you've changed your number It's like a noose around my life Every pill I took in vain Every meal for you I made Every penny I put away Asking for flowers is like asking you to be nice Don't tell me you're too tired Ten years I've been working nights My life is like a picture left out too long in the sun Now I'm trying to remember all the faces of the names I've loved And all that's left of me now is a cigarette burning bright And a fading memory of all the things I tried to get right Every pill I took in vain Every meal for you I made Every plan I tried to make Asking for flowers is like asking you to be nice Don't tell me you're too tired Ten years I've been working nightsCopper on the corner and he loaded two rounds And I can't even cross the line to talk you down And Peter, sweet baby, where'd you get that gun You spent half your life trying to turn the other half around And I tried to come clean, but I guess it's no use Your face is all over the six o'clock news They cleared the streets, and, then they closed the schools I can't even get inside Did you lose your head when the farm went down Or was it when your daddy died after he moved to town And I know your mama calls you good-for-nothing She says her baby is a failer and she don't want you calling And I tried to come clean, but I guess it's no use Your face is all over the six o'clock news They cleared the streets, and then, they closed the schools I can't even get insideI've got ways to make you sorry Start my life with someone else I've got ways to make you fall Tell you all the things that I lied about I've got ways to make you mad Just laughing at the girl sittin' on your lap I've got ways to make you sing my songs The ones I ain't written yet I've got plots you've never seen I've got moves I've never used I've got ways to make you come back to me I've got ways to make you strange Drug you up and drag you home I've got ways to track you down In all of the places you like to go I've got ways to make you crazy Wear all the things you always wanted me to I've got ways to make you run And my daddy is coming for you I've got plots you've never seen I've got moves I've never used I've got ways to make you come back to meI know your heart It is a sacred thing You're a comedian You hide behind your funny face Every time Every time Out of the shadows Out of the cameras and the lights You're a chameleon And you hide behind your darker side Every time Every time I don't need a punchline I don't need a punchline Everybody's watching The way that I see you could not change I'll be your medium For everything you wanted to say'Cause out of the shadows Out of the cameras and the lights I'm a chameleon I just hide behind the songs that I writeWanna go get high Mercury is parked outside Under the light Wanna take me to The parking lot of the old high school And it's like you said Would've turned up dead in the car And it's like you said Would've turned up dead in the car Wanna go get high Mercury is parked outside Under the light Wanna take me to The parking lot of the old high school And it's like you said Would've turned up dead in the car And it's like you said Would've turned up dead in the car
