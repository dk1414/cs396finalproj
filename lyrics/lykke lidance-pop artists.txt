love with you But only if you're a little bit, little bit Little bit in love with me And for you, I keep my legs apart And forget about my tainted heart And I will never ever be the first to say it But still I, you know I I would do it Push a button, pull the trigger, climb a mountain, jump off a cliff'Cause you know baby, I love you, love you a little bit You would do it, you would say it You would mean it and we could do it It was you and I, not only I I think I'm a little bit, little bit A little bit in love with you But only if you're a little bit, little bit Little bit in love with me I think I'm a little bit, little bit A little bit in love with you But only if you're a little bit, little bit Little bit in love with meLate night Call you in the late night Trade love for one night Two pills and a red wine Talk offline, no, I don't mind The words that you don't say No love when you hold me No callin' the next day, it's a one-way, no And now the sun is up, I'm comin' down We just blow it up, blow it out Baby, don't you cry Baby, don't you cry Ladies on my rightWait up, don't wanna wait up for you, baby Still I wait up, lonely in the canyon No love, there's no love reflecting

rain falling I have a seafull, I can give you an ocean If you like the feeling of a hard rain falling I have a seafull, I can give you an ocean We shouldn't have to work so hard to break this wave in our way Shouldn't wanna walk away so you won't see the fear I face Every time I look at you standing still, I wanna wait But you never tell me no, baby wait, baby stay We shouldn't have to work so hard to break this wave in our way Shouldn't wanna walk away so you won't see the fear I face Every time I look at you standing still, I wanna wait But you never tell me no, baby wait, baby stay So I'm trying to get us back together Though we never been apart Tryna find a shelter from the weather Before a rain came down on us You say it like it's easy but it's not easy, baby Do you see me  Do you want me Do you need me to be near you So you got somebody next to your body Somebody next to your body Keeping me up, keeping me down, keeping me up Keeping me down, keeping me up, down, up, down Keeping me up, keeping me downOpen your eyes, I'm right in front of you Open your eyes Open your eyes, I'm walking out on you for the last time I keep my heart achin'Why do we keep fakin'?I was only lyin' when I looked in your eyes I'm cryin' diamonds like a river inside And it's so sad, so sexy So sad, so sexy I was only lyin' when I looked in your eyes Now I'm lyin' with you one last time And it's so sad, so sexy So sad, so sexy Don't turn around I'm not the one for you Don't turn around I keep my heart vacant Why, donâ€™t have the guts to break itMy one heart hurt another So only one life can't be enough Can you give me just another For that one who got away Lonely I, I'm so alone now There'll be no rest for the wicked There's no song for the choir There's no hope for the weary If you let them win without a fight If one heart can mend another Only then can we begin So won't you hold on a little longer Don't let them get away Lonely I, I'm so alone now There'll be no rest for the wicked There's no song for the choir There's no hope for the weary If you let them win without a fight I let my good one down I let my true love die I had his heart, but I broke it every timeYou love me too much Don't let me do much She love me too much, at least she use to Then I used her, I abused her Never thought I'd ever lose her I confused her, but I refuse to Be so wicked, hallelujah My one heart hurt another So only one life can't be enough Can you give me just another For that one who got away Lonely I, I'm so alone now There'll be no rest for the wicked There's no song for the choir There's no hope for the weary You let them win without a fight If one heart can mend another Only then can we begin So won't you hold on a little longer Don't let them get awayThere's a possibility There's a possibility All that I had was all I gon' get Mm There's a possibility There's a possibility All I gon' get is gone with your stare All I gon' get is gone with your stare So tell me when you hear my heart stop You're the only one who knows Tell me when you hear my silence There's a possibility I wouldn't know Mm Mm Know that when you leave Know that when you leave By blood and by me, you walk like a thief By blood and by me, I fall when you leaveWhere the blue moon shines Where the tears melt ice In a sea of guilt By the fallen stars Lonely chimes sing of pain There's a storm; only love remains I been stung by a star seed, honey He shone love like lightning, honey I been hit by a star seed, honey His love burns like a lightning, honey I'm right here I'm your star crossed lover I lie here like a starless lover I'll die here as your phantom lover I never learn, I never learn
