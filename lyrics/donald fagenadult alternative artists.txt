Standing tough under stars and stripes We can tell This dream's in sight You've got to admit it At this point in time that it's clear The future looks bright On that train all graphite and glitter Undersea by rail Ninety minutes from New York to Paris Well by seventy-six we'll be A-O KWhat a beautiful world this will be What a glorious time to be free Get your ticket to that wheel in space While there's time The fix is in You'll be a witness to that game of chance in the sky You know we've got to win Here at home we'll play in the city Powered by the sun Perfect weather for a streamlined world There'll be spandex jackets one for everyone What a beautiful world this will be What a glorious time to be freeI'm Lester the Nightfly Hello Baton Rouge Won't you turn your radio down Respect the seven second delay we use So you say there's a race Of men in the trees You're for tough legislation Thanks for calling I wait all night for calls like these An independent station WJ AZ With jazz and conversation From the foot of Mt  Belzoni Sweet music Tonight the night is mine Late line 'til the sun  comes through the skyline I've got plenty of java And Chesterfield Kings But I feel like crying I wish I had a heart of ice A heart like iceYes we're gonna have a wingding A summer smoker underground It's just a dugout that my dad built In case the reds decide to push the button down We've got provisions and lots of beer The keyword is survival on the new frontier Introduce me to that big blonde She's got a touch of Tuesday Weld She's wearing Ambush and a French twist She's got us wild and she can tell She loves to limbo, that much is clear She's got the right dynamic for the new frontier Well I can't wait 'til I move to the city'Til I finally make up my mind To learn design and study overseas Do you have a steady boyfriend Cause honey I've been watching you I hear you're mad about Brubeck I like your eyes, I like him too He's an artist, a pioneer We've got to have some music on the new frontierSome say that we're reckless They say we're much too young Tell us to stop before we've begun We've got to hold out till graduation Try to hang on Maxine While the world is sleeping We meet at Lincoln Mall Talk about life, the meaning of it all Try to make sense of the suburban sprawl Try to hang on Maxine Mexico City is like another world Nice this year they say You'll be my senorita In jeans and pearls But first let's get off this highway We'll move up to Manhattan And fill the place with friends Drive to the coast and drive right back again One day we'll wake up, make love but 'til then Try to hang on MaxineThe surf was easy on the day I came to stay On this quiet island in the bay I remember a line of women all in white The laughter and the steel bands at night All the Americans are gone except for two The embassy's been hard to reach There's been talk and lately a bit of action after dark Behind the big casino on the beach The rules are changed, it's not the same It's all new players in a whole new ball game Last night, I dreamed of an old lover dressed in gray I've had this fever now since yesterday Wake up, darling, they're knocking The Colonel's standing in the sun With his stupid face the glasses and the gun I know what happens, I read the book I believe I just got the goodbye look I believe I just got the goodbye...Won't you pour me a Cuban breeze, Gretchen A shadow crossed the blue Miami sky As we hit the causeway by the big hotels We fought Now I can't remember why After all the words were said and tears were gone We vowed we'd never say goodbye When we kissed we could hear the sound of thunder As we watched the regulars rush the big hotels We kissed again as the showers swept the Florida shore You opened your umbrella But we walked between the raindrops back to your door Oh Miami!In my dreams I can hear the sound of thunder I can see the causeway by the big hotels That happy day we'll find each other on that Florida shore You'll open your umbrella And we'll walk between the raindrops back to your door We'll walk between the raindrops Between the raindrops Walk between the raindrops back to your doorUptown It's murder out in the street Uptown It's murder out in the street That's where I found my mandarin plum That's where you'd be if you found one Where the nights are bright And joy is complete Keep my squeeze on Green Flower Street Since May There's trouble most every night Since May There's trouble most every night Where once we danced our sweet routine It reeks of wine and kerosene Where the nights are bright And joy is complete Keep my squeeze on Green Flower StreetSnowbound Let's sleep in today Wake me up When the wolves come out to play Heat up These white nights We're gonna turn this town Into a city of lights At Nervous Time We roll downtown We've got scenes to crash We're gonna trick and trash We're gonna find some fun We hit the street With visors down With our thermasuits Sealed up tight We can beat the freeze And get saved tonight Let's stop off at the Metroplex That little dancer's got some style Yes she's the one I'll be waiting for At the stage door Snowbound Let's sleep in today Wake me up When the wolves come out to play Heat up These white nights We're gonna turn this town Into a city of lightsOur town is just like any other Good citizens at work and play Normal folks doin' business in the normal way This morning was like any other Mommies kissing daddies goodbye Then the milkman screamed And pointed up at the sky From Sheilus to the reefs of Kizmar From Stargate and the outer worlds They're speeding towards our sun On a party run Here come tomorrow's girls Tomorrow's girls You see them on the grass at lunch hour Soaking up the vertical rays In their summer dresses A little smile can really make your day Their kisses feel like real kisses And when they cry they cry real tears But what's left in your arms When the static clears They're landing on the Jersey beaches Their engines make the white sand swirl The heat is so intense Earth men have no defense Against tomorrow's girls Tomorrow's girlsI've got a girl and Ruby is her name She don't love me, but I love her just the same Ruby Ruby how I want you Like a ghost I'm gonna haunt you Ruby Ruby when will you be mine Each time I see you baby my heart cries I'm gonna steal you away from all those guys From the sunny day I met you Made a bet that I would get you Ruby Ruby when will you be mine I got a girl and Ruby is her name I'd give the world just to set her heart aflame Got some lovin' money too Gonna give it all to you Ruby Ruby when will you be mine
