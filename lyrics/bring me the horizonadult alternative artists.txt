What doesn't kill you makes you wish you were dead Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper, and I can't take One more moment of this silence, the loneliness is haunting me And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up It comes in waves, I close my eyes Hold my breath and let it bury me I'm not okay and it's not alright Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again Who will fix me now  Dive in when I'm down Save me from myself, don't let me drown Who will make me fight  Drag me out alive Save me from myself, don't let me drown What doesn't destroy you, leaves you broken instead Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper, and I can't take One more moment of this silence, the loneliness is haunting me And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up It comes in waves, I close my eyes Hold my breath and let it bury me I'm not okay and it's not alright Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again Do you wanna start a cult with me I'm not vibrating like I oughta be I need a purpose, I can't keep surfing Through this existential misery Now, we're gonna need some real estate But if I choose my words carefully Think I could fool you that I'm the guru Wait, how do you spell "epiphany"?Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra Yeah!Could I have your attention, please It's time to tap into your tragedy Think you could use a new abuser Close your eyes and listen carefully Imagine you're stood on a beach Water gently lapping at your feet But now you're sinking, what were you thinking That's all the time we have this weekCan you hear the silence Can you see the dark Can you fix the broken Can you feel, can you feel my heart Can you help the hopeless  Well, I'm begging on my knees Can you save my bastard soul, will you wait for me I'm sorry, brothers, so sorry, lover Forgive me, father, I love you, mother Can you hear the silence  Can you see the dark Can you fix the broken  Can you feel my heart Can you feel my heart I'm scared to get close and I hate being alone I long for that feeling to not feel at all The higher I get, the lower I'll sink I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim I'm scared to get close and I hate being alone I long for that feeling to not feel at all The higher I get, the lower I'll sink I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim I'm scared to get close and I hate being alone I long for that feeling to not feel at all The higher I get, the lower I'll sink I can't drown my demons, they know how to swimНакривил е калпачето ей така, па такаНанагоре-нанадоле, ей така, па такаНакривил е калпачето ей така, па такаНанагоре-нанадоле, ей така, па така I've got a fever, don't breathe on me I'm a believer in nobody Won't let me leave 'cause I've seen something Hope I don't sneeze, I don't *sneeze*Really we just need to fear something Only pretending to feel something I know you're dying to run I wanna turn you around Please remain calm The end has arrived We cannot save you Enjoy the ride This is the moment You've been waiting for Don't call it a warning This is a warSome resist the future, some refuse the past Either way, it's messed up if we can't unplug the fact That a world covered in cables was never wired to last So don't act so surprised when the program starts to crash Form a connection when we can't even shake hands You're like a phantom greeting me We plot in the shadows, hang out in the gallows Stuck in a loop for eternity Do you know why the flowers never bloom Will you retry or let the pain resume I need a new leader, we need a new Luden So come outside, it's time to see the tide It's out of sight, but never out of mind I need a new leader, we need a new Luden Sticks and stones may break my bones but soon the sting will pass But names can dig so many graves, you won't know where to stand And I don't feel secure no more unless I'm being followed And the only way to hide myself is to give 'em one hell of a showMy head is haunting me and my heart feels like a ghost I need to feel something, 'cause I'm still so far from home Cross your heart and hope to die Promise me you'll never leave my side Show me what I can't see when the spark in my eyes is gone You got me on my knees, I'm your one-man cult Cross my heart and hope to die Promise you I'll never leave your side'Cause I'm telling you, you're all I need I promise you, you're all I see'Cause I'm telling you, you're all I need I'll never leave So, you can drag me through hell If it meant I could hold your hand I will follow you, 'cause I'm under your spell And you can throw me to the flames I will follow you, I will follow you Come sink into me and let me breathe you in I'll be your gravity, you be my oxygen So dig two graves, 'cause when you die I swear I'll be leaving by your sideS-P-I-R-I-T, spirit Let's hear it S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit Let's hear it, let's go!I've had enough There's a voice in my head, says I'm better off dead But if I sing along a little fucking louder To a happy song, I'll be alright You want to give up Gave it all that you've got and it still doesn't cut But if you sing along a little fucking louder To a happy song, you'll be just fine, 'cause…Every now and again we get that feeling And the great big void inside us opens up And I really wish that you could help, but my head is like a carousel And I'm going 'round in circles, I'm going 'round in circles S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit Let's hear it S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit Let's hear itSometimes I wonder why are we all here Call me a nihilist, I guess I'm just unclear To why I bother, why I try Death is on my mind so much, it makes me wanna die I lost my wife this year, we've lost our friend Always fighting battles, but it never seem to end Are we just ladders in the world of snakes 'Cause if life's one big fuckin' game, well, I don't wanna play So come and sing me, sing me to sleep I dealt with too much fuckin' shit and now I'm in too deep Cut off my wings, my flowers bloomed You want salvation  Well, I'm sorry, we're all doomed Cut off my wings and come lock me up Just pull the plug, yeah, I've had enough Tear me to pieces, sell me for parts You're all vampires, so here You can have my heart You can have my heart You can have my heart You can have my heart You can have myRemember the moment you left me alone and Broke every promise you ever made I was an ocean, lost in the open Nothin' could take the pain away So you can throw me to the wolves Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack Beat me black and blue Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne The sticks and the stones that you used to throw have Built me an empire, so don't even try To cry me a river, 'cause I forgive you You are the reason I still fight So you can throw me to the wolves Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack Beat me black and blue Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne So you can throw me to the wolves Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack Beat me black and blue Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throneBlegh Hi, are you looking for the other side Feel like nothing ever seems quite right Are you circling the drainpipe, getting off on pain like You're corrupted I need to know where your loyalties lie Tell me, are you gonna bark or bite Do you really wanna twist a knife in the belly Of the monster Get the fuck up, wake the fuck up Wipe the system and back the fuck up You're a puppet, when they cut your strings off Don't comе crawling back Kingslayer, destroying castles in thе sky Kingslayer, forevermore the apple of my eye I'd sacrifice my life to find you, angel of the blade Kingslayer, come and collect us from the night暗い、この見えない世界まだ消えない未来ただ手に入れたい another world System failure Life is encrypted, you are modified Like a virus in a lullaby Artificial 'til the day you die, silly programme You're corrupted
