I picture you in the sun wondering what went wrong And falling down on your knees asking for sympathy And being caught in between all you wish for and all you seen And trying to find anything you can feel that you can believe in Always May gods love be with you Always, always May gods love be with you I know I would apologize if I could see your eyes Cause when you showed me myself, you know, I became someone else But I was caught in between all you wish for and all you need I picture you fast asleep A nightmare comes But you can't keep awake May gods love be with you Always, always May gods love be with you May gods love be with you Always, always May gods love be with youI'm strange And you're strange Don't want you to change No way Ah ha ha ah Why can't I explain Flying to the sun Without a plane When you're here Ah ha ha ah And don't you worry'bout me babe Cuz I'm right here For you to say Hope you know You inspire me You're a flower And I'm a bee I need you Ah ha ha ah All this You do for free Give me hope And I can see You're so true Ah ha ha ahDon't know why I'm still afraid If you weren't real I would make you up now I wish that I could follow through I know that your love is true, and deep, as the sea But right now, everything you want is wrong And right now, all your dreams are waking up And right now, I wish I could follow you To the shores, of freedom, where no one lives Remember when we first met And everything was still a bet In love's game You would call, I'd call you back And then I'd leave A message On your answering machine But right now, everything is turning blue And right now, the sun is trying to kill the moon And right now, I wish I could follow you To the shores, of freedom, where no one livesThere were two lofty ships From old England came Blow high, blow low And so sail we One was the Prince of Luther And the other Prince of Wales Cruisin' down the coast of High Barbary"Aloft there, aloft "Our jolly bosun cried Blow high, blow low And so sail we"Look ahead, look astern Look the weather look a-lee"Look down the coast of High Barbary"There's naught upon the stern There's naught upon our lee Blow high, blow low And so sail we But there's a lofty ship to wind'ard An' she's sailin' fast and free"Down along the coast of High Barbary"Oh hail her, oh hail her"Our gallant captain cried Blow high, blow low And so sail we"Are you a man-o-war A privateer, a merchant ship " cried he Cruisin' down the coast of High BarbaryToo young to fall For a light I think I see Can't say for sure The plants have died My hair has grown From the thought of you Coming home Cuz it ain't easier Waking up at dawn To find I lost my crown If I found you there With flowers in your hair I'd hold you in my arms Till we came back down A smile that explodes I could never understand My room too small To get by without the help of alcohol Pin my arm to the wall Now I'm too gone to fight Not afraid to fall Cuz it ain't easier Waking up at dawn To find I lost my crown If I found you there With flowers in your hairYou're the shaded sun You're daddy's broken gun You're the loneliest moon You are a butterfly dreaming about your cocoon You're the only sound when I am blind So I label you mine You're the house you grew up in You're always just arriving at your end You're your mama's shit eatin' grin and your daddy's double chin You're the first pair of shoes you ever went to school in And you're the kid pretending she's in prison Behind the bars of a jungle gym Someone's gonna give you wings And you'll think it's what you need And you'll fly You'll be so high But you're history acts as your gravity Your history acts as your gravity Acts as your history acts as your gravity You're the only one you ever believe in You're the solution and you are the problem You're a rapist and your only victim You are fact and you are fiction You're the only one you've considered a friend And now you're alive Waiting for your life to begin AgainI don't know where we've been Could you tell me where we are again And Jesus is my only friend No one else knows who I am I know I'll never make it on the cross Spent my days looking for what my daddy lost He was too proud to have a boss Sold himself out then he couldn't afford the cost No one knows how he felt Hung himself in the county jail There were those who said he would burn in hell I don't think they knew him very well Angel of love Shine a light on us I was born to be Redemption's son Angel of love Shine a light on us I was born to be Redemption's sonThere are things we cannot know Invisible hands which guide the show from up above Sometimes you are forced to go Fall away and shut the door on the one you love Well I don't know now where you are Your photograph sits like a scar up against my wall Such a pretty face The sunshine in your eyes Taken on that day When all we had was love Shut the light on me Shut the light on me Now Jesus, he came down here just to die for all my sins I need him to come back here and die for me again Cause I cannot forgive myself for what it is I've done Avoiding your memory like a vampire does the sun And all I want's your love And all I want's your love Shut the light on me Shut the light on meI don't wanna hold you hostage I wanna set you free If I could I'd pay your ransom And give your eyes to see You know my love, it will follow If you only follow me Your eyes will open up so easily I don't wanna make you suffer Or fill you up with shame What I want is to protect you Give you shelter from the rain If you take my hand and maybe Even take my name We won't have anyone else left to blame See how the horses run Round the track Until the winner come Wait for the sound of his gun And then the horses run I guess I was only dreaming I'm here all on my own I remember how you left me Homeless in my home But you said I had it coming'Cause I've always done you wrong But I was finding out where I belongI'll be silent in my solitude Can't fight my smile Or my gratitude I'm afraid of what I might do'Cuz there's no me if there's no me and you I wish that I could open up your eyes To feel the sun that burns in your mind I can't deal with what you have done Reincarnate I wonder who I might become With the potential of a loaded gun I could be as fresh as hard bubblegum I don't have nothing now I want me some First some of you Then some of everyone Oh darling since you've been away from me I know how the pins feel In the bowling alley They say love is something you feel but never see When I see you I firmly disagree I'm just trying to be all that I can be Without destroying you now Or joining the army
