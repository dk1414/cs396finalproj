If you were falling Then I would catch you You need a light I'd find a match'Cause I love the way you say good morning And you take me the way I am If you are chilly Here, take my sweater Your head is aching I'll make it better'Cause I love the way you call me baby And you take me the way I am I'd buy you Rogaine When you start losing all your hair Sew on patches To all you tearDon't you worry there, my honey We might not have any money But we've got our love to pay the bills Maybe I think you're cute and funny Maybe I wanna do what bunnies do with you If you know what I mean Oh, let's get rich And buy our parents homes in the South of France Let's get rich And give everybody nice sweaters and teach them how to dance Let's get rich And build a house on a mountain, making everybody look like ants From way up there You and I, you and I Well, you might be a bit confused And you might be a little bit bruised But, baby, how we spoon like no one else So I will help you read those books If you will soothe my worried looks And we will put the lonesome on the shelfWhen the world was ending, I'd hold you in my arms And we talked about the places we'd never been When the world was ending, we'd hold on to the past'Cause it's all we thought that we would ever see But then the sun came right back And the birds sang as if nothing had happened And it's alright, it's okay We will get another day To begin again, to begin again, to begin again I don't know how, I don't know why But I know that I will try To begin again, to begin again, to begin To live and love and breathe again When the world was ending, wе looked up at the sky And we talkеd about the last song that we'd play So far from comprehending, they'd lift us to the stars Never seen each other from so far away But then the sun came right back And the kids played as if nothing had happenedAll the broken hearts in the world still beat Let's not make it harder than it has to be Ooh, it's all the same thing Girls chase boys chase girls All the broken hearts in the world still beat Let's not make it harder than it has to be Ooh, it's all the same thing Girls chase boys chase girls I'm a little let down, but I'm not dead There's a little bit more that has to be said You play me, now I play you too Let's just call it over All the broken hearts in the world still beat Let's not make it harder than it has to be Ooh, it's all the same thing Girls chase boys chase girls All the broken hearts in the world still beat Let's not make it harder than it has to be Ooh, it's all the same thing Girls chase boys chase girlsI should've known better I saw her wearing your sweater Nice glasses, fake red hair, just like me Stop crying, stop crawling Can't you see that I have stopped falling We were good at faking forever I get it, whatever Am I gonna miss you Hell no Baby watch me up and go Mama said that the boys like you never work out any way My girlfriends say "are you gonna be sad If you calls you up you're gonna take him back " I say Hell no, oh, hell no I get it, whatever Straight up, don't blame you You’re not the Cash and I’m not the June Never be the one to make you better WhateverBum bum bum bum bum bum

cannot holdOver, I'm so over you The way that you look In a three-piece suit Over, I'm so over you The way that you held me Like nobody else would Maybe if I tell myself enough Maybe if I do I'll get over you Maybe if I tell myself enough Maybe if I do I'll get all over You You oh Over you You Over, I'm so over you The way that you laugh At everything that I do Over, I'm so over youI just wanna be
