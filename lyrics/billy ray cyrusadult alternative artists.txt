You tucked me in, turned out the light Kept me safe and sound at night Little girls depend on things like that Brushed my teeth and combed my hair Had to drive me everywhere You were always there when I looked back You had to do it all alone Make a living, make a home Must have been as hard as it could be And when I couldn't sleep at night Scared things wouldn't turn out right You would hold my hand and sing to me Caterpillar in the tree How you wonder who you'll be Can't go far, but you can always dream Wish you may and wish you might Don't you worry, hold on tight I promise you there will come a day Butterfly fly away Butterfly fly away Got your wings, now you can't stay Take those dreams and make them all come true Butterfly fly away You've been waiting for this day All along you've known just what to doYou can tell the world you never was my girl You can burn my clothes when I'm gone Or you can tell your friends just what a fool I've been And laugh and joke about me on the phone You can tell my arms go back to the farm You can tell my feet to hit the floor Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips They won't be reaching out for you no more But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart I just don't think he'd understand And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart He might blow up and kill this man, ooh You can tell your ma I moved to Arkansas You can tell your dog to bite my leg Or tell your brother Cliff whose fist can tell my lip He never really liked me anyway Or tell your Aunt Louise, tell anything you please Myself already knows I'm not okay Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind It might be walking out on me todayOh, oh-oh Oh Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more I got the horses in the back Horse tack is attached Hat is matte black Got the boots that's black to match Ridin' on a horse, ha You can whip your Porsche I been in the valley You ain't been up off that porch, now Can't nobody tell me nothin'You can't tell me nothin'Can't nobody tell me nothin'You can't tell me nothin'Oh, oh-oh Oh Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more I got the horses in the back Horse tack is attached Hat is matte black Got the boots that's black to match Ridin' on a horse, ha You can whip your Porsche I been in the valley You ain't been up off that porch, now Can't nobody tell me nothin'You can't tell me nothin'Can't nobody tell me nothin'You can't tell me nothin'There's a gold frame that sits by the window And my heart breaks a little more each time I try To picture the memory inside There's a notebook, it's too hard to read it But if you look You'd see how you look through my eye's But now one more chapter's gone by, and I know It's time to move on Even though I'm not ready I've got to be strong And trust where you're heading Even though it's not easy Right now the right kind of love is the love that lets go, go There's an old dance that we've done forever You give me your hand But let me decide when to reach You always let me be me But now's my time to take chances and find my own wings And whatever happens, I know you'll be there waiting for me It's time to move on Even though I'm not ready I've got to be strong And trust where you're heading Even though it's not easy Right now the right kind of love is the love that lets go Doesn't want to miss the future by staying in the past It will always hold on, but never hold you back And even though it's not easy Right now the right kind of love is the love that lets goOoh, oh, yeah I didn't wanna listen to what you were sayin'I thought that I knew all I need to know I didn't realize that, somewhere inside me I knew you were right, but I couldn't say so I can take care of myself, yeah You taught me well I learned from you that I do not crumble I learned that strength is something you choose All of the reasons to keep on believing There's no question, that's a lesson that I learned from you We always don't agree on what is the best way To get to the place that we're going from here But I can really trust you and give you the distance To make your decisions without any fear I'm grateful for all of the times You opened my eyesShe's gotta do what she's gotta do And I've gotta like it or not She's got dreams too big for this town And she needs to give 'em a shot Whatever they are Looks like she's all ready to leave Nothing left to pack There ain't no room for me in that car Even if she asked me to tag along God I gotta be strong She's at the starting line of the rest of her life As ready as she's ever been Got the hunger and the stars in her eyes The prize is hers to win She's waiting on my blessings Before she hits that open road Baby, get ready Get set Don't go She says things are fallin' into place Feels like they're fallin' apart I painted this big old smile on my face To hide my broken heart If only she knew This is where I don't say what I want so bad to say This is where I want to but I won't get in the way Of her and her dreams And spreading her wingsFancy cars and diamond rings I seen all kinds of shiny things I should be feeling like a king But lord I don't Great big towns, so full of users Make a million, still a loser Some may bet on you to win Most hope you won't Living wild, ain't no mercy being free When it brings you to your knees Can't keep lying I've seen the road now I know just what I need To find my way back to Tennessee I'm going home now To Southern, is so sweet And find my way back to Tennessee I was only seventeen I lived behind my beauty queen I turned my back on everything And everyone Rooms with lots of pretty faces Still don't fill the empty spaces Wandering where Amazing Grace is There is none, no Now I know, there's no comfort in this world God I miss that hometown girl Want to hold herYou tucked me in, turned out the light Kept me safe and sound at night Little girls depend on things like that Brushed my teeth and combed my hair Had to drive me everywhere You were always there when I looked back You had to do it all alone Make a living, make a home Must have been as hard as it could be And when I couldn't sleep at night

Don't you worry, hold on tight I promise you there will come a day Butterfly fly away Butterfly fly away Got your wings, now you can't stay Take those dreams and make them all come true Butterfly fly
