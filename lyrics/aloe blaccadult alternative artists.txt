awake for so long Gotta forget that feeling, give into something real I've got, I've gotta let you go Gotta let you go This morning I walked to the train, just like you did every day Everyone else is the same, I wonder if you're the same And do you lay your head in someone else's bed To help you bury it  Just like you always did And now you're in all of my words, only way I can return Memories

for the love This is sweatin' through my shirt before the sun's up Thought that I was shook, thought that I would stop And now, I got 'em waitin' for the other shoe to drop Oh, I'm a flame, burning bold in a world that's so cold I'm just gettin' started I been makin' moves before the dawn Cuttin' through the darkness Pray nobody say it don't be long I'll be the first shot heard, then you run for cover Take my word, ain't no other Now, I'm just gettin' started And I can go on, and on, and on, and on, and on I'ma drink from a winner cup, mixin' hard work with beginner's luck If I fall first, then lift me up, never call curtains, common courtesy Curiosity, it killed the kitty, but he got to work for me Inadvertently, I manifested something great, but it's still to determine the fate I'ma turn the tables, from the cradle to the grave Heavyweight leg day, steady pray Heavy head, wear his crown way down every day Here now, make a way, clear foul, lane change Breakin' out the crazy house, or whatever them people was sayin' 'bout me Hit the leverage, you're not on my level, the engine is revvin'I'm ready, I'm ready, I swear, you gon' hear about meHurt people hurt people's how it begins And I don’t wanna cause you pain This ain't the way that I thought we would live When I start to feel I'm in trouble again I just keep it as friends ’cause I know how it ends When I feel like I'll be the devil again I'll sit back and pretend like we both never met I found courage at 16, but lost it at 23 I'm not okay, I'm not okay And I lost my self-esteem believing in a dream I lost my faith, I lost my faith, oh-oh Hurt people hurt people's how it begins And I don't wanna cause you pain This ain't the way that I thought we would live You might think that I’m crazy You might think you can save me I wish it was that easy, oh-oh-oh Hurt people hurt people, that’s how it ends And I don't wanna cause you pain, eh, ehThought I was good, I was good on my own I was alright Thought I was grown and the strangers I'd known They were all right Thought that I knew everything, never wrong I was all right Oh, I was good, I was good on my own I was alright Oh, I lived a whole life Thinkin' I knew how my Heart could handle love A love I thought I knew Everything before us Was stretchin' out my heart just So it could be big enough to beat for two Never understood why People always say "Love chooses you"Now I do, now I do Didn't ever think that I could ever say "I promise you"And now I do, now I do Now I doYou make me smile You make me smile I think its safe to say Things just haven’t been going my way No work coming in, so my money is thin And I still got bills to pay But all in all you been right here with me When I’m sinking low you come through and lift me It’s nothing more than the love that you give me Keeps me from drowning in tears You make me smile You make me smile You make me smile You make me smile Everywhere I go people seem to ask me Where I get my joy, why am I so happy In these trying times when a frown is the fashion I’m beaming like the sun, now how can that be See the answer to the query is very simple I’m always grinning from dimple to dimple Because you love me unconditionally My happiness is heart-shaped, can’t you seeIf then was now And I had you back somehow I would hold you more I should have told you more If now was then And we were together again I would listen more But now I miss you more And never, I've been to a dark place Stared loneliness in the face At the lowest of my lows There ain't nothin' so broken Love can't heal, I feel Every day I grow older Time reveals, reveals That nothing's really gone We bring the past along And love goes on That nothing's really gone We bring the past along And love goes on
