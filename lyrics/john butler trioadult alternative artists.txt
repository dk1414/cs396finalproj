but Trace it back to the start When that big ol' fire came towards the Nannup town Well that greedy thing burnt more than the bush down You can bury that head and try to forget He's still waking up with Coffee, Methadone & Cigarettes In the summer of fifty-eight When innocence, shattered and broke The tree, the egg, the nest, the breast, the yolk When those thieving flames took my Granddad from my Pa And ever since then we've been mending all those scars But the bandages and ointments ain't done it He's still waking up with Coffee, Methadone & Cigarettes That broken bird somehow grew With the seven brothers and sisters moved From the country to the zoo Between the legacy visits and the boarding schools Yes he learned to dodge the books And he learned to dodge the foolsLost my love, lost my light I can't find them anymore If there's something I could give I would have given it before now, because I came back a little broken Things don't fit anymore And I wait for spring to come But how long Tell me how long'Cause I wither at my post I'm walking like a ghost, alone How long Tell me how long How long Somewhere out there on the horizon Maybe there's a glimmer of hope Maybe it's just a mirage'Cause you never knowBen got a job at the Mine along the way He said everything was fine until that fateful day That's when his luck started to change The day he went to help and go blow up that Mountain Range Ben moved to Town a year ago or maybe more Straight out of Highschool, the whole he had in store Wanted to travel, needed some dough Everybody worked the Mines Why should he say no Don't ask him why, he can't explain Why now things for him have changed It's not his land, they're not his songs He can't work out why he don't belong{Chorus}He part of Company, part of Company, part of Company Sin Won't someone please tell the lad when Humbug did begin Part of Company, part of Company, part of Company Sin Won't someone please tell the lad when Humbug did begin Now legend has it, or so they say The Bones of an Ancient People, yeah that's where they lay And their Descendants hold close to heart Oh, that Mountain Range Ben was helping blow apart And so I said for Ben things weren't quite right Now he's waking up screaming every single night Hearing voices in a different tongue The screaming of the Old, yeah, the screaming of the Young
