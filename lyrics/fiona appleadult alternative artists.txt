I was staring at the sky, just looking for a star To pray on, or wish on, or something like that I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy Whose reality I knew, was a-hopeless to be had But then the dove of hope began its downward slope And I believed for a moment that my chances Were approaching to be grabbed But as it came down near, so did a weary tear I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag Hunger hurts and I want him so bad, oh, it kills'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up I got to fold cause these hands are too shaky to hold Hunger hurts, but starving works When it costs too much to love And I went crazy again today Looking for a strand to climb, looking for a little hope Baby said he couldn't stay Wouldn't put his lips to mine and a fail to kiss is a fail to cope I said, "Honey, I don't feel so good, don't feel justified Come on put a little love here in my void,"He said "It's all in your head,"And I said, "So's everything" but he didn't get it I thought he was a man but he was just a little boyI've been thinking about when I was trying to be your friend I thought it was then, but it wasn't, it wasn't genuine I was just so furious, but I couldn't show you'Cause I know you and I know what you can do And I don't want a war with you, I won't afford it You get sore, even when you win And you maim when you're on offense But you kill when you're on defense And you've got them all convinced That you're the means and the end All the V IPs and P YTs and wannabes Afraid of not being your friend And I've always been too smart for that But you know what  My heart was not I took it like a kid, you see The cool kids voted to get rid of me I'm ashamed of what it did to me What I let get done It stole my fun, it stole my fun Fetch the bolt cutters, I've been in here too long Fetch the bolt cutters, I've been in here too long Fetch the bolt cutters, I've been in here too long Fetch the bolt cuttersI've been a bad, bad girl I've been careless with a delicate man And it's a sad, sad world When a girl will break a boy just because she can Don't you tell me to deny it I've done wrong and I want to suffer for my sins I've come to you 'cause I need guidance to be true And I just don't know where I can begin Ooh What I need is a good defense'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal And I need to be redeemed To the one I've sinned against Because he's all I ever knew of love Heaven, help me for the way I am Save me from these evil deeds before I get them done I know tomorrow brings the consequence at hand But I keep livin' this day like the next will never comeI've waited many years Every print I left upon the track Has led me here And next year, it'll be clear This was only leading me to that And by that time, I hope that You love me You love me I move with the trees in the breeze I know that time is elastic And I know when I go All my particles disband and disperse And I'll be back in the pulse And I know none of this will matter in the long run But I know a sound is still a sound around no one And while I'm in this body I want somebody to want And I want what I want and I want You to love me YouI used to walk down the streets On my way to school Grinding my teeth to a rhythm invisible I used my feet to crush dead leaves like they had fallen from trees Just for me, just to be crash cymbals In class, I'd pass the time Drawing a slash for every time The second hand went by a group of five Done twelve times was a minute But Shameika said I had potential Shameika said I had potential Shameika said I had potential Shameika said I had potential I used to march down the windy, windy sidewalks Slapping my leg with a riding crop Thinking it made me come off so tough I didn't smile, because a smile always seemed rehearsed I wasn't afraid of the bullies, and that just made the bullies worseYou didn't see my valentine I sent it via pantomime While you were watching someone else I stared at you and cut myself That's all I'll do cause I'm not free A fugitive too dull to flee I'm amorous but out of reach A still life drawing of a peach I'm a tulip in a cup I stand no chance of growing up I've made my peace, I'm dead, I'm done I watch you live to have my fun I root for you, I love you You you you you I root for you, I love you You you you you I made it to a dinner date My teardrops seasoned every plate I tried to dance but lost my nerve I cramped up in the learning curveLook at how feathered his cocks are See how seamless his frocks are Look at his paper-beating over that rockstar Look at how long she walks and how far Was she lost  Or Maybe she was not for Traveling in the stock car anymore Maybe she spent her formative years Dealing with his contentious fears And endless jeers at her endless tears Or maybe she just got tired of watching him Sniff white off a starlet's breast Treating his wife like less than a guest Getting his girl to clean up his mess Never showing weakness unless it's a ward's season It's the season of the ward And she's trying to cut the cord She's tired of planting her knees on the cold, hard floor of facts Trying to act like the other girl acts And your strike may have been exact But you know that you never really go to the mat You tie everything all pretty in the second act When you know that it didn't go exactly like thatLadies, ladies, ladies, ladies Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies Ruminations on the looming effect and the parallax view And the figure and the form and the revolving door that keeps Turning out more and more good women like you Yet another woman to whom I won't get through Ruminations on the looming effect and the parallax view And the figure and the form and the revolving door that keeps Turning out more and more good women like you Yet another woman to whom I won't get through Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies, take it easy When he leaves me, please be my guest To whatever I might've left in his kitchen cupboards In the back of his bathroom cabinets And oh yes, oh yes, oh yes There's a dress in the closet Don't get rid of it, you'd look good in it I didn't fit in it, it was never mine It belonged to the ex-wife of another ex of mine She left it behind with a note, one line, it said"I don't know if I'm coming across, but I'm really trying"She was very kindEvery single night, I endure the flight Of little wings of white-flamed butterflies in my brain These ideas of mine percolate the mind Trickle down the spine, swarm the belly, swellin' to a blaze That's where the pain comes in like a second skeleton Tryin' to fit beneath the skin, I can't fit the feelings in, oh Every single night's alight with my brain, brain I say to her, why'd I say it to her What does she think of me  That I'm not what I ought to be That I'm what I try not to be, it's got to be somebody else's fault I can't get caught If what I am is what I am 'cause I does what I does Then brother get back, 'cause my breast's gonna bust open The rib is the shell, and a heart is the yolk And I just made a meal for us both to choke on Every single night's a fight with my brain, brainI would beg to disagree But begging disagrees with me I would beg to disagree But begging disagrees with me I told you I didn't wanna go to this dinner You know I don't go for those ones that you bother about So when they say something that makes me start to simmer That fancy wine won't put this fire out, oh Kick me under the table all you want I won't shut up, I won't shut up Kick me under the table all you want I won't shut up, I won't shut up I'd like to buy you a pair of pillow-soled hiking boots To help you with your climb Or rather, to help the bodies that you step over along your route So they won't hurt like mine Kick me under the table all you want I won't shut up, I won't shut up Kick me under the table all you want I won't shut up, I won't shut up
