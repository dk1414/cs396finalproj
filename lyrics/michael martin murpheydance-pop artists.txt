She comes down from Yellow Mountain On a dark, flat land she rides On a pony she named Wildfire With a whirlwind by her side On a cold Nebraska night Oh, they say she died one winter When there came a killing frost And the pony she named Wildfire Busted down his stall In a blizzard, she was lost She ran calling Wildfire Calling Wildfire Calling Wildfire So by the dark of the moon, I planted But there came an early snow Been a hoot-owl howling outside my window now'Bout six nights in a row She's coming for me, I know And on Wildfire we're both gonna goTo the town of Agua Fria, rode a stranger one fine day Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip For the stranger there among 'em had a big iron on his hip Big iron on his hip It was early in the mornin' when he rode into town He came ridin' from the south side, slowly lookin' all around"He's an outlaw, loose and runnin'", came a whisper from each lip"He's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip Big iron on his hip"In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty-four And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more One and nineteen more Now the stranger started talkin', made it plain to folks around Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town He came there to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead Said it didn't matter, he was after Texas Red, after Texas Red Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red But the outlaw didn't worry, men that tried before were dead Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip Twenty-one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip Big iron on his hipOh way up high in the Sierra Peaks Where the yellow-jack pines grow tall Sandy Bob and Buster Jiggs Had a round-up camp last fall They’d taken their ponies and their runnin’ irons And maybe a dog or two And they allowed their brand on every long-eared calf That come within their view Now many a long-eared dogie That didn’t push  up by day Had his old ears whittled and his old hide sizzled In a most artistic way Now Sandy Bob, he said one day As he throwed his seegar down“I’m tired of this cow-ography Cowpiography And I allows I’m goin’ to town.”Well they saddled their ponies, and they struck ’em a lope And how them boys did ride And them was the days that an old cowboy Could oil up his old insidesJesse James was a lad that killed many a man He robbed the Danville train But that dirty little coward who shot Mr  Howard Has laid poor Jesse in his grave Poor Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life Three children, they were brave But the dirty little coward, who shot Mr  Howard Has laid poor Jesse in his grave Jesse was a man, a friend to the poor He never would see a man suffer pain;And with his brother, Frank, he robbed the Chicago bank And stopped the Glendale train It was Wednesday night, the moon was shining bright They robbed the Glendale train The people they did say, for many miles away It was robbed by Frank and Jesse James It wa withs his brother Frank they robbed the Gallatin bank And carried the money from the town;It was in this very place that they had a little race For they shot Captain Sheets to the ground They went to the crossing, not very far from there And there they did the same;With the agent on his knees, he delivered up the keys To the outlaws, Frank and Jesse James Saturday night, Jesse was at home Talking with his family brave Robert Ford came along like a thief in the night And laid poor Jesse in his graveThere's a great American hero, we all look up to When the times are hard and the chips are down He knows just what to do Now a cowboy's got a set of rules that he lives by day to day If you ask for his advice, he'll more than likely say If it's a fence, mend it, if it's a dollar bill, spend it Before it burns a hole down in them jeans If it's a load, truck it, if it's a punch, duck it If she's a lady, treat her like a queen That's cowboy logic, every cowboy's got it It's in the way he lives his life and the songs he sings That's cowboy logic, every cowboy's got it He's got a simple solution to just about anything If it's a job, do it, put your back in to it'Cause a little bit of dirt's gonna wash off in the rain If it's a horse, ride it, if it hurts, hide it Dust yourself off and get back on again That's cowboy logic, every cowboy's got it It's in the way he lives his life and the songs he sings That's cowboy logic, every cowboy's got it He's got a simple solution to just about anythingIf you listen close when the hot wind blows Down the dust filled streets of old tombstone You might hear an old rhyme ringin'Of the legends who walked in their long black coats And their high top boots and their .45 colts Right in to this song I'm singing That the ballad mongers made Into the rhymes of the renegades Way up in Dakota by the deadwood moon Wild Bill's ghost haunts number 10 saloon Where a coward came to get him Bill held a dead man's hand of aces and eights With his back to the door he tempted fate Old Bill never knew what hit him Gamblin' his life away To the rhymes of the renegades And in all of the towns too tough to die They're dancin' up on Boot Hill tonight Laughin' at the movies Hollywood made Dancing to the rhymes of the renegades And Billy the Kid is laughing right out loud At how they turned him into a hero somehow Who'll cast a third stone at his well known grave While chanting these rhymes of the renegades Way out in California by a long dark bend And a mask and duster blowing in the wind Black Bart still stands there waitin'And out in El Paso the thunder cloud rolls Like John Wesley Hardin's guns long ago And the west still loves to hate him For his legend will not fade From the rhymes of the renegades And all of the robbers who rode through hell And danced on the rope when the gallows fell Their demons are still with us And the vigilantes do more evil than good When they masquerade around like robin hood And they ride at night to get us From the owl hoot trails the shades Come the rhymes of the renegades And could it be true that some become outlaws Holdin' on to the last to a long lost cause Diggin' their grave with a silver spade Singing rhymes and rhymes to the renegades Some call it a mystery when waco burns From history they refuse to learn They turn their backs 'till the movie deal's made Deaf to the rhymes of the renegades They'll burn down up to heaven and stay...Cause the raid out laws on the churches and banks...They enforce the laws that where tailor made They won't hear the rhymes of the renegades They ignore the dark side of humanity They're living the illusion that were all free They'll never know how many could be saved From the lessons and the rhymes of the renegadesNow, John tells us of a city so high above Where we'll meet in a spirit of love, oh, oh Yes, we'll meet over yonder in that heavenly place There we'll see each other face-to-face Oh, I can almost see the lights of the city And they're shining down on me, ya, ya, yeah Oh, I can almost see the lights of the city Forever more I shall be free Now, John tells us about a time when time itself will be no more In the days when the trumpet shall blow There we'll meet over yonder in that heavenly place There we'll see our brothers face-to-face Oh, I can almost see the lights of the city And they're shining down on me, ya, ya, yeah Oh, I can almost see the lights of the city Forever.. I was hanging round town, just spending my time Being out of a job and not earning a dime A fellow walks up, and he says, "I suppose You're a bronc rider, from the looks of your clothes""Well, you figured me right, and I'm a good one, I claim Would you happen to have any outlaws to tame "He says, "I've got one and a good one to buck At throwing top riders, he's had lots of luck"He says this here's one pony that's never been rode And the man that gets on him is bound to get throwed I got all heat up and I asked what he'd pay To ride this old nag for a couple of days Well, he offered me ten, and I says, "I'm your man For the bronc isn't living that I couldn't fan"He says, "Get your saddle, I'll give you the chance"So we hopped in his buckboard and rode to his ranch Out in the horse corral, standing alone Is an old cavallo, a strawberry roan Little pin ears that touch at the tip A big 44 brand upon his left hip He was spavined all round, and he had pigeon toes Little pig eyes and a big roman nose U-necked and old, with a long lower jaw You could tell at a glance he's a regular outlawAs I walked out in the streets of Laredo As I walked out in Laredo one day I spied a young cowboy wrapped up in white linen Wrapped up in white linen and cold as the clay"I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy."These words he did say as I boldly walked by"Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story;Got shot in the breast and I know I must die!""Oh beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly;Play the Death March as you carry me along Take me to the green valley, andlay the sod o'er me For I'm a young cowboy and I know I´ve done wrong.""It was once in the saddle I used to go dashing:It was once in the saddle I used to go gay First to the dram house and then to the card house Got shot in the breast and I'm dying today.""Go gather around you a group of young cowboys And tell them the story of this my sad fate Tell one and the other before they go further To stop their wild roving before it's too late."We beat the drum slowly and played the fife lowly And bitterly wept as we bore him along For we all loved our comrade, so brave, young, and handsome We all loved our comrade although he'd done wrongSam Bass was born in Indiana, it was his native home And at the age of seventeen, Sam began to roam Sam first came out to Texas a cowboy for to be A kinder-hearted fellow you seldom ever see Sam used to deal in race stock, one called the Denton mare;He matched her in scrub races and took her to the fair I used to coin the money and spent it just as free He always drank good whiskey wherever he might be Sam left the Collins ranch in the merry month of May With a herd of Texas cattle the Black Hills for to see Sold out in Custer City and then got on a spree-A harder set of cowboys you seldom ever see On their way back to Texas they robbed the U.P  train And then split up in couples and started out again Joe Collins and his partner were overtaken soon With all their hard-earned money they had to meet their doom Sam had four companions-four bold and daring lads-They were Richardson, Jackson, Joe Collins, and Old Dad;Four more bold and daring cowboys the rangers never knew They whipped the Texas Rangers and ran the boys in blue Jim Murphy was arrested and then released on bail He jumped his bond at Tyler and then took the train for Terrell;But Mayor Jones had posted Jim and that was all a stall'Twas was only a plan to capture Sam before the coming fall
