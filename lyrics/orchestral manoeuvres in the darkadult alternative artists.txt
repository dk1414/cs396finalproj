Enola Gay You should have stayed at home yesterday Ah-ha, words can't describe The feeling and the way you lied These games you play They're gonna end in more than tears someday Ah-ha, Enola Gay It shouldn't ever have to end this way It's 8:15 And that's the time that it's always been We got your message on the radio Conditions normal and you're coming home Enola Gay Is mother proud of Little Boy today Ah-ha, this kiss you give It's never ever gonna fade awayIf Joan of Arc had a heart Would she give it as a gift To such as me who longs to see How an angel ought to be Her dream is to give her heart away Like an orphan along the way She cared so much, she offered up Her body to the graveIf you leave, don't leave now Please don't take my heart away Promise me, just one more night Then we'll go our separate ways We've always had time on our side Now it's fading fast Every second, every moment We've gotta make it last I touch you once, I touch you twice I won't let go at any price I need you now like I need you then You always said we'd still be friends someday If you leave I won't cry I won't waste one single day But if you leave don't look back I'll be running the other way Seven years went under the bridge Like time was standing still Heaven knows what happens now You've got to, you've gotta say you willIt's my direction, it's my proposal It's so hard it's leading me astray My obsession, it's my creation You'll understand it's not important now All I need is co-ordination I can't imagine my destination My intention ask my opinion But no excuse, my feelings still remain My feelings still remainLittle Catholic girl is falling in love A face on a page, gift from above She should have known better than to give her heart She should have known better than to ever part Without me Without me I gave her everything that I ever owned I think she understood but she never spoke She should have not tried to be that way She shouldn't have to go there ever again Without me Without me Now listen to us good, and listen well Listen to the song, everything we tell We should have known better than to give her away We should have known better to this very day Without me Without me Listen, Joan of Arc, all you got to do Say the right words and I'll be coming through Hold you in my arms and take you right away Now she's on her away to another land We never understood why she gave her hand She shouldn't ought to promise, cause it's just pretend I know she doesn't mean it and she'll leave again Without me Without meTalk to me, don't lie to me Save your breath Don't look at me, don't smile at me Just close your eyes I was so impressed by you I was running blind I would fall for every trick Every twist of mind Heaven is cold Without any soul It's hard to believe I was so in love with you Don't say your prayers, don't build your hopes Just walk away Don't phone me up, don't call around Don't waste your time You were so in awe of me You were so divine You would do just anything To still be mineOur one source of energy The ultimate discovery Electric blue for me Never more to be free Electricity Nuclear and H EP Carbon fuels from the sea Wasted electricity

always knew it would never get out There are things that I cannot tell And there are things that you know damn well This is getting very hard for me I guess you'd better just wait and see This is all This is all, oh Secret You heard a message and the message was clear All the time you wipe away that tear All I want is to hold your hand To see the sun and walk the sand You make me sad and you make me glad And now you see all my secret is, is love Is love, is love My secret is this loveIt worries me this kind of thing How you hope to live alone And occupy your waking hours We're taking sides again I just wept I couldn't understand Why you started this again And every day you send me more It makes it worse is this a plan of yours To ensure I don't forget I'd write and tell you that I've burnt them all But you never send me your address And I've, I've kept them anyway So don't ask me if I think it's true That communication can bring hope to those Who have gone their separate ways It hardly touched me when it should have then But memories are uncertain friends When recalled by messages Coded messages Poison lettersYou say that love will capture me But not unless you give it free We're sailing on the seven seas Sister Ray is on T VThe light of love that shines so bright That the F.B.I  won't sleep tonight Because I'm so in awe of you That I don't know what to do And I'm sailing on the seven seas so blue Sick and tired, and I don't know why Skin and bone won't touch the sky Sex and lies can't bring me down Because I've sold my soul all over town And I'm so in awe of you That I don't know what to do And I'm sailing on the seven seas so blue People try and drag us down So we learn to swim before we drown'Cause I'm so in awe of you That I don't know what to do And I'm sailing on the seven seas so blue And I'm so in awe of you That I don't know what to do And I'm sailing on the seven seas so blue
