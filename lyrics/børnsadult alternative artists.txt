Candy, she's sweet like candy in my veins Baby, I'm dying for another taste And every night my mind is running around her Thunder's getting louder and louder Baby, you're like lightning in a bottle I can't let you go now that I got it And all I need is to be struck By your electric love Baby, your electric love Electric love Drown me , you make my heart beat like the rain Surround me, hold me deep beneath your waves And every night my mind is running around her Thunder's getting louder and louder and louder Baby, you're like lightning in a bottle I can't let you go now that I got it And all I need is to be struck By your electric love Baby, your electric love Electric loveI was there when you fell from the clouds And landed in the desert There was a thunder inside of my heart There was a wonderful pleasure And like a stallion racin' the rain You rode on the back of my bike I knew from the song that you sang You were my lover for life Oh, there's no time to sleep Oh, living in a dream So take me to the paradise In your eyes Green like American money You taste just right Sweet like Tennessee honey And we can run away Swimmin' in the sunlight every day Oh, paradise in your eyes Green like American money So we took to the calico road Running from the weather There was a highway inside of her eyes There was a buried treasure And we got caught in the storm You started flying a kite At the end was the key to my heart You were my lover for lifeDamn, look at the sunrise Glowing finish line, made it in record time Hey, baby, we made it My head's faded, headlights dilated Spinnin', spinnin' and I can't sit still Spinnin', spinnin' and we can't sit still Baptized in blue skies Roll the window down, reach out, feel around for new life Damn, you and those green eyes We can never stop movin', we see nothin' but the green lights Spinnin', spinnin' and we can't sit still Spinnin', spinnin' and we can't sit still God save, God save our young blood God save, God save our young love Hot pavement, hot pavement, hot wheels in the sun God save our young blood God save, God save our young blood God save, God save our young love Warm waves, warm waves, on the coast where we love God save our young bloodI'll dive in deeper, deeper for you Down to the bottom, 10,000 emerald pools Down to the bottom, 10,000 emerald pools Under water Time is standing still You're the treasure Dive down deeper, still All I need is you You're all I need to breathe All I need is you I'll make a living, trying to get away10,000 fathoms, under a tidal wave It can never pull me away No way Under water Time is standing still You're the treasure Dive down deeper, stillPast lives couldn't ever hold me down Lost love is sweeter when it's finally found I've got the strangest feelin'This isn't our first time around Past lives couldn't ever come between us Sometimes the dreamers finally wake up Don't wake me, I'm not dreamin'Don't wake me, I'm not dreamin'All my past lives, they got nothin' on me Golden eagle, you're the one and only flying high Through the cities in the sky I'll take you way back, countless centuries Don't you remember that you were meant to be My Queen of Hearts, meant to be my love Through all of my lives I'd never thought I'd wait so long for you The timin' is right The stars are alignedWanna feel that stream of dopamine Wanna feel that stream of dopamine I mixed up so terribly Your body language talkin' over me And it might not be logical But, baby, my mind just won't let you leave And I crave your taste under my tongue every day Keep the forbidden fruit comin' my way I wanna feel your sugar in my veins Baby, just wanna feel Wanna feel that stream of dopamine Wanna feel that stream of dopamine You sip what the devil's drinkin'Hot as hell and I'm thinkin'Baby, baby, baby, can you take away my pain Baby, baby, baby, can you take away my pain Hearts in a cage Hearts in a cage, hearts in a cage You, you flipped the page and slipped away Never thought that you were Someone to say things that you didn't mean You didn't even call to wish me sweet dreams Really thought we made a sweet team But don't cry Consider this a lullaby Bye and sweet dreams Ticking clocks on the wall waiting for your call But that cuckoo bird won't sing at all Never thought that you would Take everything we had and loved and leaveGalaxy, galaxy Won't you be my consolation I need someone to kiss my hands and my feet And make me feel complete, oh, yeah Mysterious universe I know you're unrehearsed But I see the light in your hands You're the man with the plan, oh, yeah But it feels just like I'm falling all the time High as a pretty star Don't you break my faded heart Don't put me out Show me what it's all about Don't you break my faded heart Don't you break it, no Don't you break it, no Don't you break it, faded heart Fantasy, fantasy You got me howling like a dog in the heat I'm trying not to put up a fight But I can't lose another night, oh, no So call me your Romeo I'll show you the way my Thunderbird sings You and the suede backseat is all I'll ever needAyy, ayy Someone must have sent me to heaven Blue madonna down by the pool Just want to make her feel like a virgin A version of herself that she once knew Ooh But I just wanna watch her Like a candle in the moonlight Hotter than a blueberry flame Whats her name Smoke rising in the distance She glides in a swan dive Cooler than a strawberry shake All the rivers run back into the sea But baby donâ€™t you leave I only want you running back to me Blue madonna in my head now Blue madonna in my bed now Blue madonna cherry red now In this light Blue madonna in my head now Blue madonna in my bed now Blue madonna cherry red now Tonight, tonightBaby, baby, baby I'm scatterbrained and lost in love Ooh, I crave it on the daily That sugar pill that dopes me up Ooh, it's raining it's pourin'I picture you in the mornin'The hot water and the steam Oh, the way that you feel between Both my hands, on your hourglass The minutes, then the hours pass I wanna watch you bloom Gimme that sweet perfume It's makin' my heart beat so fast In my mind, you're the angel on the painted glass Lookin' for high, divine, connection I'm a lover, in need of confession Let me satisfy your soul I'm not a saint, but do I have to be Well, baby, you're my holy ghost And I need you close, come back to me
