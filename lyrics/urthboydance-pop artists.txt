Baby Baby Baby I'm all alone Baby Baby Baby I'm all alone, alone, alone His charms came and took me by surprise The intensity of my love and I ain't denying it We're fenced off but it's not goodbye There's no wall they can put between us that's too high I've never known a rush like that Dragged my whole heart into this plan he hatched And though he's a career crim, I wanna be near him I don't fear a thing when he calls and he sings And he says I got no one else to turn to And I really don't wanna burn you But you're all I have, will you set me free I got no one else to turn to And this old fool, he don't deserve you But you're all I have, you can set me free Baby rescue meYou make me nervous just by being here Maybe I'll disappear, sneak myself away, chin on my chest Just anything, just get me out of here I'm going The problem is the thought of you has got me grinning ear to ear I'm overthinking it, walking out the door And why can't I go through with it You're back inside, where am I going I'll rip the wings off these butterflies They make me say things I don't mean, things I don't mean Being so knotted up inside Something that I don't need, that I don't need but Suddenly you're standing there in front of me, I'm crushing hard What if we dive into a love affair right into each other's arms Oh, not a single person on the planet coulda ever swapped Could've ever swapped Could've ever swapped And I don't know what to say so I say something that I immediately regret And I have no idea what I said And I become momentarily obsessed with what I've eaten, whether that's all up in my breathe Fuck, just be cool, calm, collected If it were that easy if I weren't bound to this harness Immersed in wherever leads me so I'm charging in open-hearted Propelled by the rate it's beating, and I know that I can be charming But there are moments all of it leaves me, then our eyes lock and I ask "How was your evenin'?"See, Granddad Wanted a boy, but he got three girls, huh Found yourself tryna bridge these worlds, Ma That's a childhood guilt that you might've felt, huh But he's a man of his time and in his shell, Ma But is it normal to see mouths move Up and down, no sound alongside You learned to lipread; you learned you had to bluff too Then lit a flame to look up to a light That would guide you back home on the darkest night Robin said "a kid's drowning", you cast aside your safety Swam on out and saved his life At just eleven-years-old, something age defied and the Woman that girl became Worked Kings Cross lanes With the bottom rung and have never really Known of forgotten ones, the hopeless The homeless and on the run, so So when I see you walking with that gangsta limp A 'life lived properly' limp that grandmas get I think about the path taken and the number of steps And how it's shaping you, whatever come next To sing your song, knowing that some things go wrong I'm not loving that it's Peter Paul and Mary you want But like a bridge over trouble, carry on You're like a bridge over trouble, carry on, still singingWe get around, we get around We get around, we get around I prowl, I growl, I scowl I frown and down my brow I pout, how you like me now Yeah, we scout, I pray we out I’m kitted out much better than the next man I’m the damn groom he’s the best man Cut, tailor made ready pressed and I can help you out make you see like a desk lamp It’s suitable, freeze it pause it That’s beautiful I’m really important Don’t let the public inside of the cordon Bodyguards do whatever you need to sort em!Check me on a magazine cover Ask my opinion on something or other Ha, so I say something or other After all motherfuck' gotta sing for his supper, right Trash the room, check out, leave At least that’s the way that they’d have you believe I’m a give you whatever dream you need What you walk away with’s not what you see, no sir, no wayTook a second as he looked over the unmown lawn His hand froze on the handle of the front door Feet felt glued to the floor Driver side opens, here we go once more With the front seat feel safer than whatever lay beyond the yard The weight of disappointment lay upon him like a scar Red brick veneer look the same as the last What's the chance that this won't be the same as the last Someone else's house, someone else's rules Someone else's room, someone else's school He don't fit in anywhere and knows it Hate it when a caseworker try to sugar-coat What the fuck  These people aren't mum and dad So fuck 'em when they try to tell me that my goodness is becoming bad I must be good at it, the way that they keep coming back Kick me out, pick me up, take me to another pad Maybe this time will be different Start from scratch and begin again Maybe this time will be different Rebuild trust, restart that shit again Maybe this time will be different I'd swap it all for somebody who'd listen Maybe this time will be different What if we could trade our positions I kept a little journal from before you were born And wrote about the shape of mama's belly you formed I filled a lot of pages up inside that first six months She noticed every single movement and it's all too much Brought you back to our tiny two bedder in Dulwich Hill Salute to the red brick—to some of us you're still a big deal You see I never thought I'd own my home But here we are as the sun sets, neighbour chats away on his phone They say you grow up so quick, I don't know about that But your clothes sure as hell do And now lunch is getting packed and my diary lost track So I've got something to tell you You ain't daddy's little girl, he's a little girl's dad That's the way it's going to be And I'm sorry you inherited a man's world, baby It's not the way it's got to be You ain't daddy's little girl he's a little girl's dad And it's your world to take back Cause the men are going to try and tell you what you can and can't be And you ain't going to stand for that That's a nice way of saying that *laughs*Right So let's start this one again, huh Roll up your sleeves And face the face it’s looking right back at me It’s easier to leave it It’s easier to fake it, oh oh So I’ll go and I’ll join the free There’s people there, they’re just like me, oh Everything is gonna be alright Everything is gonna be alright January tricked you when it looked you in the eye And said no matter what you've been through with me, you'll be renewed A promise made at midnight, a fire sale that Knew it couldn't drag you into something that You don't wanna do, a heart that's full of nightfall Hanging on dear life for first signs of daylight But what if I refuse  What if it all passes like cycling of news While I'm searching for an ocean I can wade into What if I don't stick around for February's saving grace Maybe I don't know it now, I'll be in a different place What I wouldn't dare to face if I don't find my feet Til March I'll find a way of giving chase, best believe The arms of april may have open hands that hold you up The pages we're reopening from what we'd folded up We're not tryna front with all that 'winter isn't cold enough'But we can handle anything they throw at usThere's nothin' I'm runnin' from Tell you where I'm comin' from I know where I've been I've been with you, you've been with me Leather-bound diary, faded handwriting Great-granddad thought it was a war worth fighting He ended up surviving, had a daughter named Dot That's my grandma, fell in love and married her boss That's my grandpa, had a little hairdressing shop in Lakemba First child ninth of December, in the years following the war ending A baby boom set in, and now we call 'em boomers You were a straight-laced girl, say what Went and got hitched to a chain-smoking guy, say what I've got a bit of both sides no surprised, say what Like you're looking my different coloured eyes, say what I got blue from brown and green songs of Donald Byrd the Trumpets The came from a thirty-three and a third, maybe they got me My memory is a cluster of notes Forming a familiar melody I swear that I know Stress in the mornin', stress in the evenin'Stress is what I'm feelin', it's no wonder I ain't breathin'Music is my life from before I could breath Cause my daddy sang my mommy some melodious keys Melodious G, melodiously In the end it was the birth of melodious me I picked up the tune when I was in the womb And I promise I would pride 'em with the songs that I'm doing I wonder if they thought that I could change the world If I could change the world well I would change myself First-borns seem to always know better The past is in the future so I get to know better Get to breath better, get to dream better You paid for my college so I get to eat better I saw you in the past working long hours daddy I saw mama give dreams so we could be happy It's deep like my African lin'age I bet you're gonna need an African Minute Ode it to the ancestors Cause they answer prayers, cause they answerLadies and gentlemen The Signal We sending it out, bring it in  Ah ha, yeah We coming home now, right Please come home Check it out With me You come along with Urthboy and Count Bounce now Please come home Yeah, yeah, yeah You understand when we got up and on the fast train Express conga line to underline the last name It seems we’re behind and we don’t wanna start late This adrenaline is meddling with the heart rate Some of the list, well, it’s unticked and can’t wait Can’t wait to sit still and can’t break Can’t shake the shit, through it all we still partake in it Facing it like we haven’t lost faith in it Of course you got stakes in it It’s not a matter of you wasting it Like black crude in Kuwait and it, cat ‘o’ nine tails rat-racing it Spend all our days in it Raising it, cut to the paper chase and it gets cold Gets sold like fools gold gets extolled Your absence is felt tenfold And if you don’t know know that you’re welcome home behold..  And all of those thousand thoughts That could be in the back of your mind Looking at the dressing room door Am I good enough to don these whites It’s the S CG But the nerves are bilingual Often settled by a single Just hit the damn ball Yeah the game is that simple Jitter the fear of a cheap dismissal On the walls hung the accolades The names that have been engraved The Bradmans, the Benauds, the giants of the game That rose up like a fig tree out of Saturdays The kid was seeing them like basketballs The summer that he had been recalled Feet moving and a better balance on the shorter ball Scoring freely and barely getting caught at all He was brought up Nambucca River way Town of Macksville young kid begins to play The way he wields the willow outside off No matter what was throw at him well it would bounce right off Runs came in fifties and tons Ever since he was young Save your legs, Phil, it’s four more runs Baggy cap was not a match for the Australian sun Next to noses got burnt but the emblem on the front And the write up in the local paper But this time not in the back of the sports pages A local lad had cracked the Shield side A couple of years after the Ashes of ‘05 Raised his bat that much that he got his baggy green Flying across the Indian Ocean with the Australian team Number 1 ranked opposition, Dale Steyn at the peak of his powers Debuting against him in a nerve wracking hour He failed at first, caught by the keeper But it was the second innings of the match that he featured Second Test of the series a century in both innings The youngest to do it at twenty, no longer a secret And it had all gone to plan but his destiny was Never that simple cause simple is rare A temporary member in and out of the Test But soon enough a permanent threat, but there They’re in the middle that November night Let the groundsman turn on the lights The radio reports saying that the batsmen died So let the groundsman turn on the lights And all of these thousand thoughts That would be in the back of their minds There walking out the dressing room door Solemnly and side by side So let the groundsman turn on the lights Grown men crying at traffic lights And every day there were bats outside So let the groundsman turn on the lights
