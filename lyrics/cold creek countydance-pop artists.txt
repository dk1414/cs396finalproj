Gold, sunset sliding down that horizon, 360 shining slow Splitting through the hills, dripping on a field of gold Hayseed on the wind, summer blowin' in, hand out the car window She lets her hair down It's dirty blonde, but right now It looks like gold, 24 in my pocket Heart racing like a rocket I'm just waiting on the right time, whoah To make her mine for a lifetime It's what you do you do When you know, you know Feels like forever Just trying to hold my breath until the day goes dark And slip it on the hand of a girl with a heart of gold Gold, solid on the dash, speakers in the back Somehow she don't know That song right now is always gonna make her think about Gold, 24 in my pocket Heart racing like a rocket I'm just waiting on the right time, whoah To make her mine for a lifetime It's what you do you do When you know, you know Feels like forever Just trying to hold my breath until the day goes dark And slip it on the hand of a girl with a heart of gold Yeah, with her heart of gold,

finally meet eyes To sit down beside you To offer you a line To break down and buy two Of what you drink in the night That's about the time that it takes To picture you alone in your bed late night just talking on the phone Saying baby come on over I don't wanna be alone Here's the code for the door 'round back That's about the time that it takes One breath in the bar, one shot of tequila going straight to the heart Nothing more then a moment to know you're the one and it's never gonna be the same That's about the time that it takes, yeah To want you on an airplane On the way to the beach To blank on when I am sayin'To picture a ray To wonder where you come from To wish I knew you then To fall more in love than anybody's ever beenUsed to be scraping the bottom of the barrel Stuck in the gutter, dancing down the devil's path Running right into the fire, taking every wrong turn And never turning back Then like a ray of light There she was She saved my life With her loving touch Healed, like a sinner on Sunday morning Without warning, who finds amazing grace And learns to rise again Healed, 'cause she's the only angel Could ever get this mess untangled Living proof that miracles are real She got me healed Oh, she got me healed Her eyes are like looking up into heaven Her lips are like sippin' on some kind of holy wine When she lays down right here beside me She knows how to make it all alrightRound up the boys We're gonna do it right Come on girls Put 'em jeans on Make 'em tight Leave your 9 to 5 behind It's an all night kinda night This town we know How to get it done With the beer in the back And the girls in the front Put on a little Skynyrd Drive it to the middle of nowhere And kick it So live it up right here right now'Til the sun comes up and the lights go out Yeah, it's Friday night, honey let's get lit Round here last call don't mean ShhBrother, it's the last night in town So get on up, we're gonna burn it down Tell your girl grab your coat You know where we're gonna go We've both been through thick and thin Half way to hell, and back again We got one more night to get it all in Cause you'll be gone in the mornin'Those troubles Them problems Leave 'em all behind We're goin' all out, full throttle Right here tonight We got nothin' but trucks in the parking lot, yeah We're going to turn up the country And break the knob off, yeah We're goin' to do it

old party Same old girl, with the back tattoo and the cowboy boots Gon' get it started Same old paycheque, same rowdy friends Same old buying them rounds till the sun goes down Turning it up past ten Then a country song with a D J mixin'If it ain't broke boy, why you gonna fix it I still like leaning on a jukebox, cranking up a drinking song Sippin' on a whiskey, till it hits me and I'm long gone Rollin' down a back road dropping down a tailgate Blanket in my truck bed, loving that girl 'til the day breaks I'll take all that same old same old, I can get I ain't had enough of that yet Ain't had enough of that yet Something to smoke, speakers to blow Same old song keep it on ain't nothing wrong with my radio Then a country song with a D J mixin'If it ain't broke boy, why you gonna fix it There you were with your ponytail swaying Had me hooked, had me good, had me thinking Yeah man what a sight, man what a night First kiss and my heart was racing Got me then, got me now, got me chasing You for the rest of my life Yeah baby I'm still falling for you Like that very first night you and I just feeling it Sky was on fire, so was I Yeah baby it's still that way, still that way Girl I know that I'm never gonna forget how lucky I am Baby know that I'm gonna feel that way, all my days Girl when I see you it's still that way Girl I sure like where this is going Got some wine, got some candlelight flowing These shadows of us can't get enough Take a look at the love that we're making In the morning I know I'll be saying Yeah girl what a night Look at me I'm still falling for you
