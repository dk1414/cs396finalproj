Dimebag Darrell godbless that man Ripped from us by the devils hand Only thing in his plan was love and rock n' roll Cowboy from hell on a twisted trail Swept away where the wild winds wails Sad truth is you can never tell when its your time to go Well, bad news travels faster Than any good new that you hear Just one more dark disaster Makes you wonder why we're here Where were you in '94 when they found him Down there on the floor Guess he couldn't take no more Guess he needed a loaded gun Where did you sleep last night With the angels locked up tight Love was his only life Did she have another one Well, bad news travels faster Than any good new that you hear Just one more dark disaster Makes you wonder why we're hereAin't it true what they say Every dog has his day I never had mine I guess it was time Send me on down the line One piece at a time She got her way I bet it made her day Through me off to the side Took me out for a ride Kicked me down to the curb Now for all that it's worth I'm lookin' to find One that's broken like mine Chorus:Broken like mine Or some piece of mind I'll be happy when I find A love less unkind Broken like mine I wish I was in her shoes With nothin' left to lose Carry myself down To the lonely side of town Tell her just how I feel I need something now that's real Don't you tell me that love is blind A heart ain't got that kind of time Unless it's broken like mineCheck me out in my easy chair Bottle in my hand How it ever got to go far I guess I'll never understand Cause I bend and bend until I break Then I bend some more Sometimes I feel like a piece of dirt down on your floor I bang my head against the wall Bang it until it bleeds To me it makes no difference at all I got to bang it till I' can't see Don't know what you think of me I don't really care I got to bang my head against the wall cause it's there I sit and stare at the telephone Why don't it ring Once upon a time I thought I knew it all Turns out I don't know God Damn thing Pick it up and I throw it down I pick it up again I'm gonna keep slammin' it to the floor till someone's on the other end I don't know why I'm sittin' here Seems like I used to know Knew everything I wanted everywhere I needed to go Friends stop and they smile at me They say you got it all But what they don't know what they don't see Are the holes up and down my hallWell I gotta friend that lives south of town Loves to sit and burn one down Spin some vinyl on his stereo Every now and then he speaks of war One tour of duty on a foreign shore Fightin' for his way home Yeah, fightin' for his way home Returnin' home to his native land Left New York for Texas man Quieter times were in his cards He met a girl she met a man Dropped to his knees and he took her hand A simple life ain't that hard No, a simple life ain't all that hard A new generation on the ground Nothin' in the world could bring him down Flyin' like he had wings Several years came and went Not one of them was poorly spent A good man's life he was chiselin'Yeah, a good man's life he was chiselin'Reflectinâ€™ on the Viet Cong Uncle John's Band and a Dylan song Smellin' like it's supper time You know it brought a tear to his eye The day that Jerry Garcia died He said he was the genius of his time Yeah, A Friend of the Devil is a Friend of MineSirens wail and a flashin' light Nothing better to do on a Tuesday night But give me hell Where you headed, what are you out for We don't see much of you 'round here anymore I guess it's just as well Well once upon a time you had it all You let everybody down You're always seventeen in your hometown Running from your folks, running from the law Running from love, running from your fears, running from it all You keep on running boy You run yourself in the ground You're always seventeen in your hometown Her porch swing still looks the same She probably won't even remember my name Just like she didn't back then Is she married, is she doing fine Does she know about all the nights I lay awake crying Just to know her hand The door opens and I run away, just like the same 'ole clown You're always seventeen in your hometown Running from your folks, running from the law Running from love, running from your fears, running from it all You keep on running boy You run yourself in the ground You're always seventeen in your hometownWell it's late, and you know I've been up drinkin'Talkin' to myself up and down the hall Ain't it great, another fabulous disaster Well I can't wait, for the next hammer fall You may have won this battle baby But it don't mean I won't win the war And you, you don't even know what it is that you're fightin' for Well it's early, I know you've been up waitin'Waitin' for me to finally call Talkin' dirty, it ain't what you really wanted To slam another phone up against the wall You may have won this battle baby But it don't mean I won't win the war And you, you don't even know what it is that you're fightin' for Well think about me when you're out there honey You know sometimes that I will Sometimes I feel like a broken stone rollin' down your hillShe picked up the telephone All she heard was dial tone She really thought she heard it ring this time She said what am I thinking I must be only dreaming Or maybe it's the hundred times he's crossed my mind Just tonight She said maybe I miss your loving Maybe I miss your kiss, just a little bit Maybe I miss your body, lying right next to mine Maybe I miss your touch, a little too much Tossing and turning her skin's still burning From the fire in his hands Running on empty, she needs somebody But somebody wouldn't understand Then the telephone rings She said maybe I miss your loving Maybe I miss your kiss, just a little bit Maybe I miss your body, lying right next to mine Maybe I miss your touch, a little too much They talked about Savannah Sweet home Alabama And how he missed the way she always smiled"Are you coming back soon""By the Harvest moon If I have to walk every mile on my knees"She's got that certain thing about her Sometimes it drops me to my knees Sometimes it makes it hard to love her But I always come around and see Chorus:Hey lady, I'm nothin' without you Hey baby, you're nothin' without me We got it constantly One look from her eyes gets me thinkin'What the hell could I have done this time But it's love that I mistake for anger The woman drives me outta my mind Can't wrap my mind around her leavin'If she did they'd surely find me gone Tons of heartache upon piles of grieving Not a chance in hell I could carry on She's got that certain thing about herWell, I used to be crazy, yeah, they called me a fool Guess I wasn't myself back when I wanted you Now you're comin' round again, the same old look in your eye Yeah I'd have to be crazy to fall again for your lies I'm gonna break these chains around my broken heart You could have had it once, but you tore it all apart I'm gonna throw your lyin' eyes over my left shoulder I'm not gonna let you wear your crown This time around I can't stay any longer I gotta be on my way I've heard a thousand times Everything that you got to say Show myself to the door I'll turn out your light Get back in my car You'll be alone again tonight I'm gonna break these chains around my broken heart You could have had it once, but you tore it all apart I'm gonna throw your lyin' eyes over my left shoulder I'm not gonna let you wear your crown This time aroundI was a wise man I lived my life As if tomorrow wasn't there I loved my people I walked the line Now I'm flyin' through the air Chorus:On a cloud On a cloud On a cloud Lookin' down Tell my brothers that I love 'em Tell my sisters that I'm free Tell my children, oh how I miss 'em But Heaven's waitin' there for me Bridge:And I'm flying like a bird It's everything that you heard Keep your eyes up in the sky You might see me sailing by
