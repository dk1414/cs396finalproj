you can, into the wild blue Set me free, oh, I pray Closer to Heaven above and closer to you Closer to you I wanna walk and not run I wanna skip and not fall I wanna look at the horizon And not see a building standing tall I wanna be the only one For miles and miles Except for maybe you And your simple smile Oh, it sounds good to me Yes, it sounds so good to meOkay I hope you die peacefully in

Wanda were the best of friends All through their high school days Both members of the 4 H Club Both active in the F FA After graduation Mary Anne went out Lookin' for a bright new world Wanda looked all around this town And all she found was Earl Well it wasn't two weeks after she got married That Wanda started gettin' abused She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses And makeup to cover a bruise Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce She let the law take it from there But Earl walked right through that restraining order And put her in intensive care Right away, Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta On a red-eye midnight flight She held Wanda's hand and they worked out a plan And it didn't take 'em long to decideWho doesn't know what I'm talkin' about Who's never left home, who's never struck out To find a dream and a life of their own A place in the clouds, a foundation of stone Many precede and many will follow A young girl's dreams no longer hollow It takes the shape of a place out west But what it holds for her, she hasn't yet guessed She needs, wide open spaces Room to make her big mistakes She needs, new faces She knows the high stakes She traveled this road as a child Wide-eyed and grinning, she never tired But now she won't be coming back with the rest If these are life's lessons, she'll take this test She needs, wide open spaces Room to make her big mistakes She needs, new faces She knows the high stakes She knows the high stakes
