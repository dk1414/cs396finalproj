Of all the torment I've been through I never knew hell 'till I met you Your imperious aura, your needs understood You wouldn't tell me the truth if you could But in the back room, a garden of delight Cut through the bar just like a fist fight For a moment, I thought I saw something in your eyes That's when I was taken by surprise Soul of washrag, show no sadness Face of poker, show no fears Overwhelming, you show no mercy Mediocre, show no tears Now this party's crazy, I gotta go But before I leave, I gotta know That night in that room full of violent screams When you whispered me your secret dreams As we both laid there on the floor You said, "it takes two to start a war"The lie is so real, I almost believe it Conceit flows like sewage How could you conceive it Shake my hand, look me in the eye Smile and think of ways I'll die Plastic bomb, plastic smile Fake commitment, blood soaked style Wrapped in a fur, trapped in a cancer The swansong's over for the littlest dancer Mistrust so explosive, apathetic corrosive When I ask for it straight up False face is compulsive Try to stand tall, falling face down Big fish, Small town, Small fish, Ghost townQuit my job, told my boss to stand aside Grabbed a gun, a fifth of booze, jumped in my ride I got my girl, she's sixteen and she's really special I can't slow down, I've got a date with the devil Two tons of steel, one hundred miles an hour No looking back, grooving on the power Responsibility made me quit I'm sick of this motherfucking goddamn shit There's a road, beyond it lies, I don't know I just gotta run, I just gotta go No looking back, grooving on the power I, I never sang a love song And I never owned a car But I've never met a machine who would drive me this far I'm not gonna listen to a word you say I'm leaving in the morning, just to get away I can't stand myself for just another day I'm leaving in the morning, just to get awayDon't get paid, shave my head Wear a smile for those who are saved Buried in my palms a nail Burning in my souls a hell Look in my heart, see the pain Look in my brain, see the hate Lost direction sold my mind Erase all thoughts to keep hate pure Following the mindless driven by hate I know what's coming and I can't wait Look me in the eyes and I'll be gone Don't get paid, shave my head Wear a smile for those who are saved Buried in my palms a nail Burning in my souls a hell Look in my heart, see the pain Look in my brain, see the hateRaised right-wing since you were born It nothing new to me  Keep it in the family Incest breed, what a fix, you're the casualty Your eyes are too blind to see Goose steps to cries of poor  Follow no more Try to even the score  Enlisted at seventeen Can't see what I mean  Come on man use your brain I hear you pack a gun Ugly American White bread fed  Gun rack head Your braincells and more are dead I bet you voted republican and you got a sheet in your closet With holes out for eyes "yeah thats right"You dress up at night  You're a big tough man When you're with your friends But when there's only one you run and hide"four more years four more years"That's what the brainwashed shout Scream them down Shut them out Its really messed up  You and me made it that way Why do you torture so  Why don't you just let go You might have more than me I'm not so blind I can't see The rich getting richer, who says that it has to be Money talks, money screams Middle class lies, Amerikan dreams The rich get richer, the poor get poorer Who says it has to beYoung and dumb, truth and justice fantasy Fresh out of the academy Five-time loser bust his head, make your day Unless you're paid off, then you look away Do you think this corruption will ever stop What makes a person want to be a cop Ran a red light, storm his house and bust the guy Do you like to see his children cry Pick up a hooker, take her for a little ride But get sucked off on the side Sworn to serve and protect, forget the killing Badge-wearing fascist villain Pissed on the street, you bust the guy Do you like to see his children cry The badge means you suck, a child lays there dead As you look back what goes through your head Some still call him pig Some still call him pig Young and dumb, truth and justice fantasy Fresh out of the academy Five-time loser bust his head, make your day Unless you're paid off, then you look awayFuck you!Do this, don't do that Breaking rules is where it's at And that's the way it's gonna stay If you don't wanna try You better have a reason why Pass the laws obey by it Break the rules don't give a shit I only have one commandment Destroy to create, build a new Smash the hate What are they for Why were rules made To be broken!Who's to blame For all your flaws Make abortion outlawed And put prayer back in school The truth is as clear as a cespool I say piss on all your fucking rules From where I stand The inside view of a promised land Is the inside view of a garbage can I'll bite the hand that feeds me shit I am getting sick of the taste of itIm looking for a cure, but where I'm standing It looks like another one, nothing but bad things Nothing but emptiness, a hit and run life won't take you nowhere Nothing but bad dreams, a screaming image running around Don't ask me again cause you know what I said It hurts, in my headache, in my headache I tell it to go away, but it plans to stay I don't want to play dead, it hurts My headache, my head, in my headache it fucking hurts And everybody's fucking everyone else Cut themselves scar their feelings put on a shelf Then look in the mirror, see your reflection, but can you see yourself In your head you hear, a screaming image running aroundI go full speed don't look back Do what I feel and live how I want to Hide in your big warm house, lock the door and dream of more They say the meek will inherit the earth but who's gonna pay the tax Begging, scraping, sucking my welfare check Bitching about big brother while big sister scratches my back Hit and miss lifestyle  Down on whats it's up to be Is this the one for me I play a rule breaker's game  This game is called life Its not as easy as a cut of the cards or a twist of the knife Day to day, hand to mouth Is that what my life's story is all about Lifestyles of the poor and homeless I'm drunk and obnoxious and I hate the rich The seed we planted is starting to show But we screamed "no future" a thousand years ago My belief is true, what about you I take the good with the bad and the bad with the bad But I wish the bad would stop What you practice now is what you preached then Young and poor  Was told what it was to be I wasn't taught how to pronounce "free"
