grafted devil's getting funky like The Neville Brothers from the Bayou, so why you wanna trip Just play the sidelines, kid, and wait for me to slip Cause I can feel it "In the Air Tonight"But yo I'm not Phil Collins, I'm more like Henry Rollins Cause I Search and Destroy every toy with a plot Trying to get what I got, you might get shot!Hot damn, I'm a slam you like O NY XThen teach you how to write a rhyme like Hooked on Phonics Mother Goose ain't got shit on me Cause I'll get loose at the jam and wreck the whole party I make em jump and mosh, oh my gosh Just slamming in the pit while I'm kicking my shit They bugging in the aisles cause I got mad styles And ain't a damn thing funny, I get money in piles Some people thought I died, that's just a rumor though Others thought I fell off, but now I'm Numero Uno Dos, not Quatro Word to Kool Keith, I'm a break up your teeth When I die Bury me Hang my balls from the cherry tree Let them get ripe  then take a bite And if they don't taste right Then don't blame D  Ya see, I'm Irish, but I'm not a leprechaun You wanna fight, then step up and we'll get it on You'll get a right to the grill, I'm white and I ill A descendant of Dublin with

If you can't get wit it, you'll wind up sweatin' it Then you'll get a beaten just like an egg It's so hard to run when ya got a broken leg But we can have a run off, the House of Pain'll come off We got the cake that you're tryin' to get a crumb off The Irish stylie, the Celtic jazz No one has it, just us, that's it If you try to take it, I got a big shillelagh I don't have dreads, 'cause I shave my head daily You call me a skinhead, I call you a pinhead Yo, where you been man  Just like the Tin Man You got no heart, here comes the good part I pick 'em, buck 'em, cut 'em up, and buck 'em down No fuckin' aroundI kicks the flavor like Stephen King writes horror If I was a Jew, then I'd light a Menorah I got rhymes for ya, excuse me, Se√±ora Are you a whore or are you a lady Is it Erica Boyer or Marcia Brady Let me know hon, the deed'll get done Just assume the position I'll take my rod and then I'll go fishin'I'll get your river flowin'I'm always in the knowin'It comes to givin' pleasure I'm every woman's treasure I came to work your body, so let me do my job I've never been laid off, my rhyming skill paid off'Cause now I'm makin' records, now I'm makin' tapes Steady bustin' suckers in bunches like grapes Makin' all the papes, scoopin' up the loot Putting suckers on the run, pull my gun and then I shoot I never been a front, I never been a fraud I got a natural skill, for that I thank the Lord'Cause I feel blessed, I'm casually dressed I always got my gun but I never wear a vest I'm quick on the draw like the horse named Mc Graw From the cartoon boom shalock lock boomStraight out the casket, rising up Open up your eyes, can't you see me What the fuck is this  Madness, pick up my bones Erase my name from off the tombstones Alive and kicking, breathing the air Call out my name, punk, and I'll be there No question, my suggestions of the action Caught smack dab in the middle of the blasting Messing with me, you're messing with the best Blaow, you're taking two shots to your chest Cause I'm back from the dead Everlast coming back from the dead You know I'm back from the dead And I'll put a freaking hole in your head!Back from the dead Back from the dead You can't disrespect it, I'm the resurrected Back from the dead just to mess with your head I'll stress what I said, but I won't repeat it If you've got a cold starve it, if you've got a fever feed it And if you can't beat it, then what a blow You might be positive and not even know I rock the hardcore from the floor to the ceiling I give sexual healing, I'll get your girl squealing like a pig My grave's something you can never dig I'll rock a mausoleum, backyard or colosseumYeah, the House of Pain...I'm sick, demented I came and represented I rose from the grave I had a close shave The cops tried to lock me down'Cause the Glock they found was stolen That's how I'm rollin'Calvin Klein's no friend of mine So I don't like Marky Or the monarchy Don't start me up like a Rolling Stone I'll leave ya sulkin' like Macaulay Culkin in 'Home Alone'So get a grip like Steven Tyler I used to trip with the Divine Styler Back in the days there were Irish ways And Irish laws, stand up for The Cause When it's time to rock a funky joint I'm on point When it's time to rock a funky jam I'm the man Victimized But you're in bed Stumble out And run dead If it ever paid To self start Environment Make you smart Just another victim Just another victim Just another victim, kid I heard it once But not before Begging off And livin' bored My hands are tied Webbed feet again Fell in behind And claim us dead Just another victim Just another victim Just another victimPack it up, pack it in, let me begin I came to win, battle me, that's a sin I won't ever slack up, punk, ya better back up Try and play the
