It's not the long, flowing dress that you're in Or the light coming off of your skin The fragile heart you protected for so long Or the mercy in your sense of right and wrong It's not your hands searching slow in the dark Or your nails leaving love's watermark It's not the way you talk me off the roof Your questions like directions to the truth It's knowing that this can't go on forever Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone Maybe we'll get forty years together But one day I'll be gone Or one day you'll be gone If we were vampires and death was a joke We'd go out on the sidewalk and smoke Laugh at all the lovers and their plans I wouldn't feel the need to hold your hand Maybe time running out is a gift I'll work hard 'til the end of my shift And give you every second I can find And hope it isn't me who's left behindA heart on the run keeps a hand on a gun It can't trust anyone I was so sure what I needed was more Tried to shoot out the sun Days when we raged, we flew off the page Such damage was done But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew I was meant for someone So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good Put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress In Richmond on high But I sobered up and I swore off that stuff Forever this time And the old lover's sing, "I thought it'd be me Who helped him get home"But home was a dream, one I'd never seen'Til you came alongThis is how you make yourself vanish into nothing And this is how you make yourself worthy of the love that she Gave to you back when you didn’t own a beautiful thing This is how you make yourself call your mother And this is how you make yourself closer to your brother And remember him back when he was small enough to help you sing You thought God was an architect, now you know He’s something like a pipe bomb ready to blow And everything you built that’s all for show goes up in flames In 24 frames This is how you see yourself floating on the ceiling And this is how you help her when her heart stops beating What happened to the part of you that noticed every changing wind And this is how you talk to her when no one else is listening And this is how you help her when the muse goes missing You vanish so she can go drowning in a dream againShe said, "Andy, you're better than your past"Winked at me and drained her glass Crosslegged on the barstool, like nobody sits anymore She said, "Andy, you're taking me home"But I knew she planned to sleep alone I'd carry her to bed and sweep up the hair from the floor If I had fucked her before she got sick I'd never hear the end of it She don't have the spirit for that now We just drink our drinks and laugh out loud Bitch about the weekend crowd And try to ignore the elephant somehow Somehow She said, "Andy, you crack me up"Seagrams in a coffee cup Sharecropper eyes and her hair almost all gone When she was drunk she made cancer jokes Made up her own doctor's notes Surrounded by her family, I saw that she was dying alone I'd sing her classic country songs And she'd get high and sing along She don't have a voice to sing with now We burn these joints in effigy Cry about what we used to be Try to ignore the elephant somehow SomehowThe ground was wet and the sky was dark You took her bet, she took your heart Wrapped it 'round an oak tree Like you did that '67 G TO Oh no Lovers leave chaos and clothes In quiet corners where you rarely ever go One day you find proof she was real Despite your struggle to forget Oh yes You're in a fight to the death my friend Black metal t-shirts your shield You've got your past on your breath my friend Now name all the monsters you've killed Let's name all the monsters you've killed The man she chose to take your place Turns his collar up to better frame his face How you'd love to hate her But you just can't hate somebody you don't know Oh no Did she leave a trail of crumbs So you could find her when you're what you could become Or did she know you well enough To realize that garden just won't grow Oh noI used to think that this was my town What a stupid thing to think I hear you're fighting off a breakdown I myself am on the brink I used to want to be a real man I don't know what that even means Now I just want you in my arms again And we can search each other's dreams I know you're tired And you ain't sleeping well Uninspired And likely mad as hell But wherever you are I hope the high road leads you home again I've heard enough of the white man's blues I've sang enough about myself So if you're looking for some bad news You can find it somewhere else Last year was a son of a bitch For nearly everyone we know But I ain't fighting with you down in a ditch I'll meet you up here on the roadI guess we’re leaving town again We’re moving out and moving in Gotta break the news to all my friends But they won't care They'll just find another face To fall behind, to take my place To run way out past second base And just stand there A dreamsicle on a summer night In a folding lawn chair Witch's ring around the moon Better get home soon Poison oak to poison ivy Dirty jokes that blew right by me Mama curling up beside me Crying to herself Why can't Daddy just come home Forget whatever he did wrong He's in a hotel all alone And we need helpI couldn't be happy in the city at night You can't see the stars from the neon light Sidewalk's dirty and the river's worse The underground trains all run in reverse Nobody here can dance like me Everybody clapping on the one and the three Am I the last of my kind Am I the last of my kind So many people with so much to do The winter's so cold my hands turn blue Old men sleeping on the filthy ground They spend their whole day just walking around Nobody else here seems to care They walk right past them like they ain't even there Am I the last of my kind Am I the last of my kind Daddy said the river would always lead me home But the river can't take me back in time and daddy's dead and gone The family farm's a parking lot for Walton's five and dime Am I the last of my kind Am I the last of my kind What've I done to help What've I done to help Somebody save me What've I done to help What've I done to help And not myself What've I done to help What've I done to help Somebody save me What've I done to help What've I done to help And not myself Thought I was alone in the world Until my memories gathered 'round me in the night Thought I was strong Until I finally had to fight If I kept my head down And showed up to work on time and watched my appetite Put the money in the mattress Lock the doors at night, and we'd all be alright What've I done to help What've I done to help Somebody save me What've I done to help What've I done to help And not myself The nurse helped us buckle the seat in the car And they sent us on our way, I drove home so slow We had no instructions, the first days were hard But there's things about babies a woman just knows Three in the morning I lay my hand over Your heart just to know you were safe in your sleep When you started walking I fight back the urge To stay right there beside you, keep you on your feet Being your daddy comes natural The roses just know how to grow It's easy to see that you'll get where you're going The hard part is letting you go The hard part is letting you go It didn't take long to see you got the best of me And your mama's merciful heart in your eyes And helping her raise you has taught me to see through The great fog of loneliness, the devil's disguise Being your daddy comes natural The roses just know how to grow It's easy to see that you'll get where you're going But the hard part is letting you go The hard part is letting you go
