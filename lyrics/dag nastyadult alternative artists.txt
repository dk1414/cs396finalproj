It's hard to hold When the world is spinning Learned nothing from the night before Or the weeks Or the weeks before that Under your influence Right goes wrong Under your influence Crossed my mind Under your influence Right goes wrong Under your influence You've crossed my line For the last time Twelve ounces of courage Makes the world look better You love the attention You never had it You never had it before Under your influence Right goes wrong Under your influence Crossed my mind Under your influence Right goes wrong Under your influence You've crossed my line For the last timeI wouldn't speak my mind I didn't want to make them mad I looked up to them For the courage I thought I didn't have I never bothered to lift a finger To make my point Now I'm spelling it out And nobody's listening It's hard to take it to heart And it hurts to be apart But I can't Watch And not be heard The days go by Things get worse But they say they can only get better I try to make a dent But it blends in all the damage I try to look The other way But there's a mirror behind me I see images of what could be done It seems like I'm the only oneWhat can I say  What should I try I tried to love what I knew I hated I took a lie and I made it truth I defended what I should have denied I never gave a second thought I never gave a second thought I followed blindly, part of the lot I never gave a second thought I followed blindly, part of the lot I never gave What can I say  What should I try I tried to love what I knew I hated I took a lie and I made it truth I defended what I should have denied I never gave a second thought I never gave a second thought I followed blindly, part of the lot I never gave a second thought I followed blindly, part of the lot I never gaveWhat'd you say When I said We'll be here through tomorrow In my heart and in my head Fear of failure Fear of reprimand Two big problems I've never had I never doubted what I had inside What I had inside Values here In my heart And we'll be here through tomorrow Every day's a brand new start Fear of failure Fear of reprimand Two big problems I've never had I never doubted what you had inside What you had inside Fear of failure Fear of reprimand Two big problems I've never had I never doubted what we had inside What we had insideThere are things I'd like to say That I've said too many times before Things I should have done Instead of looking for a way to get out You'll never know The sorrow I felt Or all the hours I've laid awake Thinking about Just what you said How could you know how I felt I never took the time To figure it out And see how the problems arose I tried to blame the two of you I can only blame myself For the pain we felt There are words I should have spoken But I kept my fucking mouth shut instead Words Would've made a difference But they always stayed unsaidSilly boy In over his head again Silly boy Doing his best again Silly boy Why don't you ever learn Oh, silly boy You can't help getting hurt Lying and hiding The lying, the hiding Lying and hiding The lying and hiding Silly boy In over his head again Silly boy Doing his best again Silly boy Why don't you ever learn, why don't you, why don't you, why don't you, why don't you, why don't youâ€”Silly boy You can't help getting hurtI heard this I heard that What do I believe It's hard to give It's hard to get And once you've lost it, it's always gone I know I shouldn't accept One person's word as truth Without at least giving you The benefit of the doubt I get so mixed up By the things you say And The way you act I get so mixed up By the things you say And The way you act I heard this I heard that What do I believe It's hard to give It's hard to get And once you've lost it, it's always gone I know I shouldn't accept One person's word as truth Without at least Giving you the benefit of the doubtAlways caring always mine Always reaching for what isn't there It just isn't there at all The smallest doubt can swell and grow And all hope shrinks into indifference It makes no difference to me I was only five When I heard the tale of the little train that said"I think I can"But what's hard to give is hard to get And once you've lost it it's always gone It's always gone Sometimes I wish that I could cry Instead of wondering what's on her mind What was on my mind this time For consolation there's always a next time But will you take the time It will take some time Don't misunderstand Half the time I can Don't misunderstand Half the time I only think I canI just wanna ride, so drive I don't care where we're going to Just go, just drive I don't care if we ever come back here Just drive I wanna lay back and close my eyes Just let me close my eyes Don't hold my hand Don't hold my hand Don't hold my hand Don't hold my hand Don't hold my hand Fear is the law, duty is pain Shame is necessary To grind the edges from our minds Our minds She's hurting now She let the smooth taste fool her Now when she opens up her eyes Her head's on fireThere's a thin line Between love and hate I'm standing in the no-man's land and I'm afraid To try and reach The other side How could you give back what you took and tried to hide I should have never trusted you Left you by yourself I watched for far too long Now you can't get out You made me think You were untouched And all the pain I felt when I knew you'd moved on I should have realized You're running in circles I let you lead when I knew damn well you were blind I should have never trusted you Left you by yourself I watched for far too long Now you can't get out I trusted you I trusted you I trusted you I trusted you I trusted you I trusted you I trusted you I trusted you I trusted you I trusted you I trusted you I trusted you
