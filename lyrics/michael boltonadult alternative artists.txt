I could hardly believe it, when I heard the news today I had to come and get it straight from you They said you were leavin', someone's swept your heart away From the look upon your face, I see it's true So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'Oh, then tell me one thing more before I go Tell me, how am I supposed to live without you Now that I've been loving you so long How am I supposed to live without you And how am I supposed to carry on When all that I've been livin' for is gone I'm too proud for cryin', didn't come here to break down It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end And how can I blame you when I built my world around The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming, oh Even now, it's more than I can takeWhen a man loves a woman Can't keep his mind on nothin' else He'd trade the world For the good thing he's found If she is bad, he can't see it She can do no wrong Turn his back on his best friend If he puts her down When a man loves a woman Spend his very last dime Trying to hold on To what he needs He'd give up all his comforts Sleep out in the rain If she said that's the way It oughta be, hey When a man loves a woman, hey I give you everything I've got Trying to hold on to your precious love Baby, baby please don't treat me bad When a man loves a woman Deep down in his soul She can bring him Such miseryI have often dreamed, of a far-off place Where a hero's welcome, would be waiting for me Where the crowds will cheer, when they see my face And a voice keeps saying, "This is where I'm meant to be."I'll be there someday, I can go the distance I will find my way, if I can be strong I know every mile, will be worth my while When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong Down an unknown road, to embrace my fate Though the road may wander, it will lead me to you And a thousand years, would be worth the wait It may take a lifetime, but somehow I'll see it through And I won't look back, I can go the distance And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat It's an uphill slope, but I won't lose hope Till I go the distance and my journey is complete But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part For a hero's strength is measured by his heartOoh-ooh, ooh-ooh You are the candle, love's the flame A fire that burns through wind and rain Shine your light on this heart of mine'Til the end of time You came to me like the dawn through the night Just shinin' like the sun Out of my dreams and into my life You are the one, you are the one Said I loved you but I lied'Cause this is more than love I feel inside Said I loved you but I was wrong'Cause love could never ever feel so strong Said I loved you but I lied With all my soul, I've tried in vain How can mere words my heart explain This taste of heaven, so deep, so true I've found in youSometimes in our lives We all have pain We all have sorrow But, if we are wise We know that there's Always tomorrow Oh yeah Lean on me When you're not strong I'll be your friend I'll help you carry on For it won't be long'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on Please swallow your pride If I have things You need to borrow For no one can fill those of your needs That you won't let show Just call on me, brother When you need a hand We all need somebody to lean on I just might have a problem That you'd understand We all need somebody to lean onAre you feeling down Like you just can't do it today I can see your frown But it's all gonna be okay So believe in yourself There's no givin' up The power's inside Yeah, that's whassup!It's the kick in the pants You needed This song will open up your eyesThere's a light A certain kind of light That never shown on me I want my life to be Lived with you Lived with you There's a way Everybody says To do each and every little thing But what does it bring If I ain't got you If I ain't got you Baby you don't know what its like Baby you don't know what its like To love somebody To love somebody The way I love you In my mind I see your face again I know my frame of mind You ain't got to be so blind But I'm blind So very blind I'm a man Can't you see
