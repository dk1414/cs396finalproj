- Should I call Johnny  What else to do  Alone on a Saturday night- Well, let me tell you one rule, I always live by- Cassie, you're always right You've got to take it as it comes, you'll never get a guy, now If you chase a guy down too You'll never get a guy if your heart always tells you what to do You've gotta think with your head, girl, not with your heart If you ever want a love so true Oh girl, take my advice, take it as it comes- But if I don’t call him now, what if he ends up in a date with another girl - Well, let me tell you to find true love, you gotta first look like yourself- Johnny's not picking up, I gotta make him see  If I show up at his house he'll fall in love with me- You gotta be strong girl, don’t bring yourself down- But he's the only boy I want around Yourself alone today But girl, you can't go on this way What happens if he never calls Now there's no looking back I can't get myself off this track You've got to take it as it comes, you'll never get a guy, now If you chase a guy down too You'll never get a guy if your heart always tells you what to do You've gotta think with your head, girl, not with your heart If you ever want a love so true Oh girl, take my advice, take it as it comes You've gotta think with your head, girl, not with your heart If you ever wanna someone true Oh girl, take my advice, take it as it comes You're gonna take it as it comes, you're gonna take it as it comesSick again More often than not at the hands of men I’m sick to death Just well enough to speak a final breath Enough Is it in my head  Wishing I were dead I wanna hurl myself into the sea Is it in my mind  Do you think I’m fine But then it’s not like this ever meant anything to me I lost it all My final brain cell banged against the wall Just one more day Tomorrow maybe I’ll wake up and say"Enough"And I’m not myself, I am someone else I’m everyone they wanted me to be And I’m not O K, I’m sick every day But then it’s not like this ever meant anything to meI'm looking for something to do But the world offers me nothing without you You went too far then took it all away I tried so hard to think of what to say But nothing I could do could make you stay, yeah I'm looking for something to do But the world offers me nothing without you We went to the beach and you took my hand And the stars shined so bright as we walked in the sand But these are the things you don’t understand You lied to me and told me that you care You captured me with your intensive stare But nothing I could do could make you there We went to the diner late at night And you gazed in my eyes and you held me so tight But these are the things that you can’t make rightYou say you're all messed up, you're not O KYou've been fucked up for so long There's nothing good about this and nothing real will ever come of this So now it's done and you're going home all alone And I'm going home by myself Tomorrow night I'll meet someone else so on and on and on They say they're messed up it's not O KThey act like they're so damaged But everyone is, everyone is, everyone is done with it for goodThe thought of that just makes me wanna cry So send a plume of smoke into the night sky We get up on the freeway, wild in our ways Said "It’s all right with me, have a nice time today"In the 7-11 parking lot Until we roll over to the next spot We get up on the freeway, a queen and her kind Said "It’s all right with me" and then my heart starts to sing We get up on the freeway and our breath stinks of alcohol You said it matters nothing of what God thinks, she kills us all We get up on the freeway and our breath reeks of alcohol I said it matters nothing 'cause when God speaks, she kills us all We get up on the freeway, free as a bird Said it matters nothing of the lies that you heard End up back at your place at the dawning Holding you so tight that I can feel you breathe I would never leave I would never leaveI’m feeling the weight of my skin Cuts me from within It’s tearing me up from inside I basically died But most of all, most of all, most of all, most of all Most of all, most of all, most of all I’m a tainted mess You’ll say she’s the best A demon in beautiful dress You’re good to impress And most of all, most of all, most of all, most of all Most of all, most of all, most of all You’ll think it’s chill when you don’t talk to me but I’m losing my best friend Now that there’s someone there instead of me Well this could be the endKeep it to myself, no way He knows what I know, he feels what I feel I'll tell the world about the love that I found Keep it to myself, no way He sees what I see, he feels what I feel I'll tell the world about the love that I found Keep it to myself, no way He has what no one else has, he knows what no one else knows I'll tell the world about the love the love, the love that I foundThis memory is all I need to feel O KSo leave me with my memory to sleep the day Sleep the day away Everything that came before is just an empty shell What did I need to move on  Well, time did tell Oh You’re on your own But you don’t want me back for more On and on and on and on This memory is all I need to feel alright So leave me with my memory to stay inside It’s just another night of trying not to survive What’s the future  What’s the past  It stumbled into place There’s nothing here that I forgot that I can’t chase Oh You wanted all But you don’t want me back for more On and on and on and on and You wanted something here so bad You wanted something you never had You wanted something for so long But you’re wrong And it’s just another night of wishing I could go homePlease, say goodnight Got no love to give, I’m on a lonely ride Night comes undone When I go to sleep, no word from anyone Though I miss having you by my side No, you can’t come here tonight'Cause I’m a lonely girl'Cause I’m a lonely girl Stare, see through time Do my magic tricks, turn water into wine It took its toll Body with no life, a heart without a soul Though I miss having you by my side No, you can’t come here tonight'Cause I’m a lonely girl'Cause I’m a lonely girl- Should I call Johnny  What else to do  Alone on a Saturday
