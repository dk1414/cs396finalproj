Now, here you go again You say you want your freedom Well, who am I to keep you down It's only right that you should Play the way you feel it But listen carefully to the sound Of your loneliness Like a heartbeat drives you mad In the stillness of rememberin' What you had and what you lost And what you had and what you lost Oh, thunder only happens when it's rainin'Players only love you when they're playing Say, "Women, they will come and they will go"When the rain washes you clean, you'll know You'll knowI took my love, took it down I climbed a mountain and I turned around And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills'Til the landslide brought me down Oh, mirror in the sky What is love Can the child within my heart rise above Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides Can I handle the seasons of my life Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm Well, I've been afraid of changin''Cause I've built my life around you But time makes you bolder Even children get older And I'm getting older too Well, I've been afraid of changin''Cause I've built my life around you But time makes you bolder Even children get older And I'm getting older too Oh, I'm getting older tooFuck Listen to the wind blow Watch the sun rise Run in the shadows Damn your love, damn your lies And if you don't love me now You will never love me again I can still hear you sayin'You would never break the chain And if you don't love me now You will never love me again I can still hear you sayin' You would never break the chain Listen to the wind blow Down comes the night Run in the shadows Damn your love, damn your lies Break the silence Damn the dark, damn the lightYou could be my silver spring Blue-green colors flashin'I would be your only dream Your shinin' autumn ocean crashin'And don't say that she's pretty And did you say that she loved you Baby, I don't wanna know So, I begin not to love you Turn around, see me running I say, "I loved you years ago"Tell myself you never loved me, no And don't say that she's pretty And did you say that she loved you Baby, I don't wanna know, oh, no And can you tell me, was it worth it Baby, I don't wanna know Time cast a spell on you But you won't forget me I know I could have loved you But you would not let meRhiannon rings like a bell through the night And wouldn't you love to love her Takes to the sky like a bird in flight And who will be her lover All your life you've never seen Woman taken by the wind Would you stay if she promised you heaven Will you ever win She is like a cat in the dark And then she is the darkness She rules her life like a fine skylark And when the sky is starless All your life you've never seen Woman taken by the wind Would you stay if she promised you heaven Will you ever win Will you ever win Rhiannon Rhiannon Rhiannon RhiannonLoving you isn't the right thing to do How can I ever change things that I feel If I could, maybe I'd give you my world How can I when you won't take it from me You can go your own way, go your own way You can call it another lonely day You can go your own way, go your own way Tell me why everything turned around Packing up, shacking up's all you wanna do If I could, baby, I'd give you my world Open up, everything's waiting for you You can go your own way, go your own way You can call it another lonely day You can go your own way, go your own way You can go your own way, go your own way You can call it another lonely day, another lonely day You can go your own way, go your own way You can call it another lonely day, another lonely daySo I'm back, to the velvet underground Back to the floor, that I love To a room with some lace and paper flowers Back to the gypsy that I was To the gypsy that I was And it all comes down to you Well you know that it does And lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice Oh, and it lights up the night And you see your gypsy You see your gypsy To the gypsy that remains Faces freedom with a little fear I have no fear, I have only love And if I was a child And the child was enough Enough for me to love Enough to love She is dancing away from me now She was just a wish She was just a wish And a memory is all that is left for you now You see your gypsy, oh You see your gypsyFor you, there'll be no more crying For you, the sun will be shining And I feel that when I'm with you It's alright, I know it's right To you, I will give the world To you, I'll never be cold'Cause I feel that when I'm with you It's alright, I know it's right And the songbirds are singing Like they know the score And I love you, I love you, I love you Like never before And I wish you all the love in the world But most of all, I wish it from myself And the songbirds keep singing Like they know the score And I love you, I love you, I love you Like never beforeCalling out your name Calling out your name Can you hear me calling out your name You know that I'm falling and I don't know what to say I'll speak a little louder, I'll even shout You know that I'm proud and I can't get the words out Oh I I wanna be with you everywhere Oh I I wanna be with you everywhere Something's happening, happening to me My friends say I'm acting peculiarly Come along, baby, we better make a start You better make it soon before you break my heart Oh I I wanna be with you everywhere Oh I I wanna be with you everywhere​If I could turn the page In time then I'd rearrange Just a day or two Close my, close my, close my eyes But I couldn't find a way So I'll settle for one day To believe in you Tell me, tell me, tell me lies Tell me lies Tell me sweet little lies Oh, no, no, you can't disguise Tell me lies Tell me sweet little lies Although I'm not making plans I hope that you understand There's a reason why Close your, close your, close your eyes No more broken hearts We're better off apart Let's give it a try Tell me, tell me, tell me lies
