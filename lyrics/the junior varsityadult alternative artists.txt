Locals read me Like I'm not supposed to be where I should be But I creep To the backbone of my being Raise your flags but keep your distance Steal and skin go get your reasons Raise your flags but keep your distance Steal and skin I feel right at home in my town Happy day And step out into the freezing morning air Feels good to know that everyone here Feels good to know that everyone waves by habit But it makes my day by habit But it makes my day by I thought I'd be Right where I wanted to be So what now I crashed the course Could I get back on it Steal to live and that's my reason Steal to liveConfess I have kept All that I create Confess I have killed All that I have kept Pull up your shirt Show some baby fat to the world You know the commercials will walk with you You're a flower Wake up bastard I could pretend dead if I want to I could fake it I could walk away if I got to I could make it I'm still losing My virginities This is how it feels To know Everyone's got something they're running out of This is how it feels To know Everyone's got something they're running out ofSo tired and half insane I'm fed a steady diet of novacaine But it's not enough to numb the pain But when the sky, the sky comes falling down And our burned up bodies reach into the ground There's voices from all around But we don't make a sound So if this is the end I hope it goes as planned Good God damn, those boys are blue You know it's good for them It better be good for you And what did they really expect us to do Just keep quiet and don't be afraid Just stay hungry for that minimum wage We got a war to fight And mouths to feed So don't you complain to me So if this is the end I hope it goes as planned You can't hide your bloody hands from me Once I had this dream where Everything's as good as it seems and Love was really all that we needed All that we needed All that we needed I wish I never wpke upBigfoot step over me Spare me from embarrassing defeat Numb to the thought existing I'd be ecstatic Would the find complete the puzzle for me I could be fiction from the entry The entry What do you think you know I know it's okay now Lay down more stupid rules That only I apply to I'm mad for Medusa But hung up on how it feels to be a ceramic And now you know If I call it how I see it I may never call it Your teeth, you talk and talk And I never follow If you repeat what you hear You won't be repeating, be repeating, be repeating Anything to anyone I'm mad for Medusa But hung up on how it feels to be a ceramic And now you knowWords like butterflies crash into my eyes A kamikaze flight right into my eyes Words like razor blades slice into my veins Exposing all my pain all that's left of me When this shade of this shade of sadness Little dead will dance again Now I'm gone shove me away There's nothing more or left to say I had to live only to die I always dieI'll sell you the things that you really don't need You've got to make your friends Feel like you're prettier than they will ever be It's all subjective and it's all perspective It's all confused and I'm not amused But it's quickly changing everything that I thought Grown up at eighteen She said she read about it in magazine She found at school It's like they expect you to believe You can drive your new S UV Straight up to heaven It's all subjective and it's all perspective It's all confused and I'm not amused But it's quickly changing everything that I thought That I believed Wish I'd forget everything that I want Not that I need If I had a car Or better yet the drive We're better off to drive on I'd stop tossing and turning It's almost my turn to drive If you had a dream With less caffeine and more laughing And steadied your hands I'd call that a plan But I wouldn't give in to it You are what you are As you are, just for you Change as you find that change is good for you Be what you will be Not for me, not for anyone but You are what you are As you are, just for youI see no ground or sky I "don't not" see people And sometimes I do I have no time to waste Searching for answers To questions that have none We'll all die, I can live with that You finally found a way to fit inside my skin I say "don't worry" 'cause it's coming around again I finally found a way to fit inside my skin I begged "don't worry" 'cause I always come through in the end Don't keep a collection Piling up Counting all of your karma But you are still Searching for answers To questions that have none We'll all die, I can live with that You finally found a way to fit inside my skin I say "don't worry" 'cause it's coming around again I finally found a way to fit inside my skin I begged "don't worry" 'cause I always come through in the endGeorgia's coming back to claim my brother's half But my full blood stepped back I work with mercy, I'll put you down in the ground But this mercy's made up Take all of the talk like it's the blessed truth But no one tells you Just keep up the peace is what I say to me It's a work I must do I'm headed to the coast So I can check out all the beaches P.S  Mom I love you all the way to Jesus I cut the ground and cracked the earth A hole in December is worth the work And all that it appears to be This pet cemetery Is where I work I'm home, hooray I'm coming home with great intentions Don't call me a quitter, I've got great ideas Just wait til I set one into motion Send one straight to prison I'm headed to the coast So I can check out all the beaches P.S  Mom I love you all the way to Jesus I cut the ground and cracked the earth A hole in December is worth the work And all that it appears to be This pet cemetery Is where I workLike an ashtray Hidden in The corner of a room That I'm not accustomed to Hope you don't mind If you know what I mean Hope you don't mind If you know what I mean Like a best friend Caught up in A bed of razor wire Dying to get out Hope you don't mind If you know what I mean Could you arrest me for my actions Detest me for my habits I've been known to act on impulse Insert a fist into the wall Call it all coincidental Keep it under the table"I'm going to be with you," I said And what it had to come to I wanted to look and feel like you And stand up as straight as arrows I'll never really catch you I gave my warning But oh when I do I thought I'd really catch you I'm holding on I stopped trying so hard And forgot I've finally come so far I've picked up the basics And started on the exit I've thought of everything I can This knife, a rope, a match I swear, I swear I'm thinking of you I'm letting go at last This must be perfect I will accept no less in my own death I hope that you come through I stopped trying so hard And forgot I've finally come so far I've picked up the basics And started on the exit
