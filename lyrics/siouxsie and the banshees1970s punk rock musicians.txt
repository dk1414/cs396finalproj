Creeping up the backstairs Slinking into dark stalls Shapeless and slumped in bath chairs Furtive eyes peep out of holes She has many guises She'll do what you want her to Playing dead and sweet submission Cracks the whip deadpan on cue Peek-a-Boo, peek-a-Boo Peek-a-Boo, peek-a-Boo Reeking like a pigsty Peeling back and gagging free Flaccid ego in your hand Chokes on dry tears, can you

delayed Kiss them for me, if I am delayed It's divoon, oh, it's serene In the fountain's pink champagne Someone carving their devotion In the heart-shaped pool of fame, oh Nothing or no one Will ever

summertime To thaw your hearts in wintertime That's why they're singing, singing Waiting for a sign To turn blood into wine The sweet taste in your mouth Turned bitter in its glass Israel, in Israel Israel, in Israel Shattered fragments of the past Meet in veins on the stained glass Like the lifeline in your palm Red and green reflects the scene Of a long forgotten dream There were princes and there were kingsInto the line, I see it fine Into the line, our hearts entwine Remember when, your time again Remember when, your time again Standing in the light, always sitting on the line Never on a side, always wanting to be right Standing in the light, I never wanted to be right Now I'm attracted by the light And blinded by the sight Into the light, into the light Into the light, into the light Into the light I see it fight Into the light, a new horizon Bleached into white, kept out of sight Bleached into white, kept out of sight Standing in the light, always sitting on the line Never on a side, pushing out the light Standing in the light I never wanted to be right Now I'm attracted by the light And blinded by the sight Remember when, your time again Remember when, your time again
