Faith pours from your walls Drowning your calls I've tried to hear You're not near Remembering when I saw your face Shining my way Pure timing Now I've fallen in deep Slow silent sleep It's killing me I'm dying To put a little bit of sunshine in your life Soleil All over you Warm sun Pours over me Soleil All over you Warm sun Now this slick fallen rift Came like a gift Your body moves Ever nearerCome see what we all talk about People moving to the moon Stop baby don't go stop here Never stop living here Till it eats the heart from your soul Keeps down the sound of your Silent sigh  Silent sigh, silent sigh Silent, silent silent Keeps down all move me down Cos the way we love each other Come see what we all talk about People moving to the moon Stop baby don't go stop here Never stop living here Till it eats the heart from your soul Keeps down the sound of your Silent sigh, Silent Sigh, Silent Sigh Silent sigh silent sigh silent sigh Keeps down all move me down But don't love each other No don't love each other Never gonna be the sound, get it on See, si See, si See, si Silent sigh Silent, silent silent silent silent, sigh Please don't, all, move me down Silent, silent, silent silent sigh Silent sigh Move me down We're gonna love, each otherMerry Christmas Pay for the light But you may still slide Baby, it's not your sleigh ride But this year is ours And maybe tomorrow We're gonna see Things we'd never believe I'll make you want me, you'll see The initial warning is free Only to reindeer Oh what a sight As they take their first flight Oh darling, it's all in time And I will, I will I will, I will I will, I will I will wait their return All made into the sky Oh what a sight, beautifulAnd you, were right to bide your time and not buy into my misery Well the good things are never free Do the colours of the rainbow look the same to everyone And I, was rushin' round in circles for a reason to believe Wipe the slime from of your sleeve You could follow me for weeks and i'm not goin' anywhere Sometimes it's hard to love someone Until the day that they are gone And I, just had a dream the other night I was married to the Queen And Madonna lived next door I think she took a shine to me And the kids were all grown up But I had to turn her down coz I was still in love with you I'm turnin' Madonna down I'm callin' it my best move I'll get a ticket to what you need I, remember doin' nothin' on the night Sinatra died And the night Jeff Buckley died And the night Kurt Cobain died And the night John Lennon died I remember I stayed up to watch the news with everyoneBeen feeling high And then feeling low Strap your hands across my engines I'm not broke so please don't mend me You're like a neon sign You just burn so bright Penetrates like an infection Give me feelings I can't mention Maybe all I need You need too Don't wait for me I'll wait for you I'm gonna follow you around I'm gonna wear you down I don't want to alienate you I got as long as it might take you Things come in ones And double up to twos Don't want to rain on your prossession Only seeking your obsession Maybe all I need You need too Don't wait for me I'll wait for youI'll leave you now In safe hands Cool your soul It's love still stands But failing that Just cool down Wouldn't you love to make it Is this real or am I just Imagining With wings take flight The rose of why And with that rose The case is closed But I need you now To help me somehow Well I'm scared to face it This final kiss But I know I'll remember it You gave your best to me Allow yourself to be FreeYou quiver like a candle on fire I'm putting you out Maybe tonight we could be the last shout And I'm fascinated by your style Your beauty will last for a while You're feeling instead of being The more that I live on the inside There's nothing to give I'm infatuated by your moves I've gotta search hard for your clues I want to repair your desire And call it a gift That I stole from just wanting to live Now I see the vision through your eyes Your innocence no longer fuels surprise Trying to outrun your fear You're running to lose Heart on your sleeve and your soul in your shoes Take a left A sharp left and another left Meet me on the corner, we'll start againI found a new remedy to defeat almost anything at all Is it true you tell me we're failing to see that we were dreaming of a lifestyle I can't believe that I fall for it every time The feelings ebb and flow like the tide But it's true what i would do if i were you Stop waiting for the summertime in wintertime Can't be right Don't subscribe to this jive Like waiting for the summertime in winter And if you turn up the dream to cure yourself free from searching for a new afterlife The purpose of life, you know there's still time to tune into the right side Well i assumed that we were lovers yesterday The turning tide when love has to pray You know what i would do if i were you Stop waiting for the summertime in wintertime Can't be right Don't subscribe to this jive Like waiting for the summertime in winterI'm a failure at heart But it seems I succeed When my heart feels the need To be helpful It doesn't happen much And as a result It's a rare thing Did I see you today Well if so I'd keep grace Cos I don't hold your face In my memory Everybody looks the same There's nothing else to blame But my, but my memory It's a craze no one knows Still I'm craving the days When this town was alive And amazing And for once I'm on time Still I'm falling around To the sights of this town'til they find meAnd well, I have to say If I don't know what I have to say If I could find a way Then I would find what I need to say Say something Say something that you mean Birds in the sky steal my melodies All I know is I don't now what this means But sometimes it's good To rearrange the orders of things Rubies and diamonds Rubies and diamonds Throw me to the lions Make me a man And if I had to wait for a time Where things fall into place If I could see your face Then it would change all I have to say Mean something Mean something that you say Birds in the sky sing my melodies And I don't know why I don't know what this means
