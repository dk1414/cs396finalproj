He left a card, a bar of soap And a scrubbing brush next to a note That said, "Use these down to your bones"And before I knew I had shiny skin And it felt easy being clean like him I thought "This one knows better than I do"A triangle Tryna squeeze through a circle He tried to cut me so I'd fit And doesn't that sound familiar Doesn't that hit too close to home Doesn't that make you shiver;The way things coulda gone And doesn't it feel peculiar When everyone wants a little more And so that I do remember To never go that far Could you leave me with a scar So the next one came with a bag of treats She smelled like sugar and spoke like the sea And she told me, "Don't trust them, trust me"Then she pulled at my stitches one by one Looked at my insides, clicking her tongue And said, "This will all have to come undone"I don't know what I've done Or if I like what I've begun But something told me to run And honey you know me it's all or none There were sounds in my head Little voices whispering That I should go and this should end Oh and I found myself listening'Cause I don't know who I am, who I am without you All I know is that I should And I don't know if I could stand another hand upon me All I know is that I should'Cause she will love you more than I could She who dares to stand where I stood See I thought love was black and white That it was wrong or it was right But you ain't leaving without a fight And I think I am just as torn inside'Cause I don't know who I am, who I am without you All I know is that I should And I don't know if I could stand another hand upon me All I know is that I should'Cause she will love you more than I could She who dares to stand where I stoodI believe I did Everything I could I believe I did Everything by the book I believe I did Lose the fight, lose the fight Cause it wasn't enough To give you everything Was not enough To let you deeply in I ran through dark city streets to hold you Through the night But where'd you end up now Do we even live in the same town Do you ever think about that time We snuck into the cemetery at night Oh where'd you end up, tell Do you have a hole in your heart as well And do you ever think about that time We snuck into the cemetery at night Get out get out get out of my mind Get out get out get out of my mind I want to forget that nightFeel it falling off like clothing Taste it rolling on your tongue See the lights above you glowing Oh and breathe them deep into your lungs It was always simple, not hidden hard You’ve been pulling at the strings playing puppeteer for kings And you’ve had enough But the search ends here Where the night is totally clear And your heart is fierce So now you finally know that you control where you go You can steer So hold this feeling like a new born Of freedom surging through your veins You have opened up a new door So bring on the wind, fire and rain It was always simple, not hidden hard You’ve been played at a game called remembering your name And you stuffed it up But the search ends here Where the night is totally clear And your heart is fierce So now you finally know that you control where you go You can steerIf they would let me trade I'd give a year for half a day Just curled up on the sofa with you We'd wander down to Cottesloe Eat fish and chips in the final glow I'd hold my breath for, I forgive you Sometimes I feel you with me in the dark And your face is in the faces of the strangers walking by me in the park And reflected in your eyes Is all my love and all my lies Is all my promise and my pride Is all my fear and all my fight Is all my dread and my denial And though we cannot be together I know that I will carry you wherever I go I will carry you Lord knows I will carry you I will carry you And reflected in your eyes Is all my love and all my lies Is all my promise and my pride Is all my fear and all my fight Is all my dread and my denialI know all the lines to say, the part I'm expected to play But in the reflection I am worlds away As I put my costume on, eyelashes one by one Been doing this so long I can tie the knot behind my back And everyone's waiting But it's getting harder to hear What my heart is saying Cos everyone's waiting"Just swallow and breathe", she says, "Remember this ain't for you it's for them, and all of those painful lessons you've had to learn, you gotta use them now or never"'Cos everyone's waiting But it's getting harder to hear What my heart keeps saying Turn it off, I wanna turn it all off When everyone's waiting It makes it harder to hear What my heart keeps saying Turn it off, I wanna turn it all off But everyone's waiting I hear that answers appear When you just stand still But make it all, how do you make it all stop When everyone's waiting Everyone's waitingI've hardly been outside my room in days Cause I don't feel that I deserve the sunshine's rays The darkness helped until the whiskey wore away And it was then I realized the conscience never fades When you're young you have this image of your life That you'll be scrupulous and one day even make a wife And you make boundaries you'd never dream to cross And if you happen to you wake completely lost But I will fight for you Be sure that I will fight Until we're the special two once again And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together Our hands will not be taught to hold another's Cause we're the special two And we could only see each other, we'll breathe together These arms will not be taught to need another's Cause we're the special two I remember someone old once said to me That lies will lock you up with truth the only key But I was comfortable and warm inside my shell And couldn't see this place could soon become my hellLike a freeze-dried rose You will never be what you were, what you were To me in memory But if I listen to the dark You'll embrace me like a star Envelope me, envelope me If things get real for me down here Promise to take me to before you went away If only for a day If things get real for me down here Promise to take me back to the tune we played Before you went away And if I listen to the sound of white Sometimes I hear your smile and breathe your light Yeah, if I listen to the sound of white You're my mystery, one mystery My mystery, one mystery My silence solidifies'Til that hollow void erases you, erases you So I can't feel at all But if I never feel again At least that nothingness will end the painful dream Of you and meThis is the first time That I've ever loved anything more than life itself I never knew my heart could expand to this size This is the first time That I've ever jumped out of my head and left it behind And I don't think that I wanna rush back inside How could it be his little hands grew inside of me I never made anything so perfectly This is the first time That I've ever seen beauty in dust caught by the sunlight Falling around us in the quiet This is the first time That I haven't been able to keep out all of the pain that goes on'Cause every man now is somebody's son How could it be those little toes grew inside of me I never made anything so perfectly Oh, but the nightmares, they don't stop The ones where I can't find you Or I've left you alone in the dark And I run, screaming Shouting, "Where is my baby  Where has my baby gone "Without him, I simply could never go onIt's not my fault, it can't be my fault That you speak to me, yeah, the way you do Now I'm split in two, I'm half me and half you But I hate us both, don't you No, of course you don't, of course you don't You said life is peachy without me Of course you don't, of course you don't You said life is peachy without me And it's not your fault, it can't be your fault That I let you crawl inside my head'Cause now you know my places and you know that face But I hate this taste, don't you No, of course you don't, of course you don't You said life is peachy without me Of course you don't, of course you don't You said life is peachy without me Oh, grieve me Oh, I love you Oh, grieve me Oh
