"6-6-1, report altitude Mayday, mayday, mayday, Pakistan 6-6-1 Sir, we've lost one engine Roger, Pakistan"Take what you got and leave now You're wearing out your welcome No one here wants to see you, hear you Think that you've won from day one But soon the devil will come You know just why he wants you, don't you Your crooked desire left us in disarray Misguided, divided, at the point of no return You started a fire, you're gonna watch it burn Try to save yourself like you always do Every bridge we build You think it's yours to burn it down, just burn it down When everything is gone You'll wish you only heard us out, heard us out Screaming mayday MaydayThe small simple lies poison everything One by one killing all of the memories Now it's time to put this heart out of its misery'Cause I've been dying, dying for too long The small simple lies poison everything One by one killing all of the memories You can take what you want And leave when you please But just remember I'm not waiting for you No, I won't wait for you I swear I gave you anything and everything Every little piece of me But all you did was look away When I said, "I've had enough I'm moving on"You said your love was never lost I guess you didn't realize Until all of it was gone Until all of it was gone The pain and the fights never seemed to end Every night wondering if we're even friends Now it's time to put this love out of it's misery'Cause it's been dying, dying for too long Dying for too longLet's go!You think we're different You think we never feel the way you do We've got scars to prove we're too Nothing but human Fueled by emotions that we thought we knew But really had no clue Pressure, it's not the end of the world Think where you started from To where you're standing now Failure, it's not the end of the world The best of us rise from the fall This is the end, this is the end You're not alone in this, my friend This is the end, this is the end Soak in your weakness See if those colors feel right for you The best of black and blue Embrace the darkness The light is there so don't give in to fear You'll make it throughTake a bow and rest in peace We're all sick of your disease Nothing here will be the same The damage has been done Well I hope you had your fun Leading with a crooked crown A world that's spinning upside down You won't think it's funny when you're falling You will never be "the one"It's sad to say some things never change You will always be "that one"We can't forget the biggest of mistakes Take a bow and rest in peace We're all sick of your disease Nothing here will be the same The damage has been done Well I hope you had your fun Because the game is over Standing with a loaded gun You probably think you own the sun Will you think it's funny when we're dying You will never be "the one"It's sad to say some things never change You will always be "that one"We can't forget the biggest of mistakesI still remember when you used to be my friend How could you take everything we had and throw it all away The sound of silence is getting old Stuck inside this hell Your heart may beat but still is cold Tell me how long can you go You don't ever stop, stop, stop Until you get your way And I'm getting sick, sick, sick More than I'd ever say I bite my tongue every time and keep it in Because you won't ever stop, stop, stop Until the bitter end So here we go until it all breaks down I still remember when you used to be my friend I'm sorry if somehow you think I'll take the blame you're wrong Take a look inside the mirror Go point the finger at yourself You don't ever stop, stop, stop Until you get your way And I'm getting sick, sick, sick More than I'd ever say I bite my tongue every time and keep it in Because you won't ever stop, stop, stop Until the bitter end When it breaksThere's a voice inside that haunts me, it wants the light I'm ashamed of this, it's on me to make it right Sew the seams 'cause this is not the end No, I will not give in this time Not afraid of pain, I won't be tonight Turning the page, finding the way Learn from the fire I've been burned and I've been bruised But I face the demons with nothing to lose Never let 'em hold me down to the ground I'm makin' it through 'cause I write the story In the sands of hate I've buried myself alive Just to find my fate was to carry the weight of my pride Sew the seams 'cause this is not the end No, I will not give in this time Paint me black but I will never fade No, I won't fade into the night I've been burned and I've been bruised But I face the demons with nothing to lose Never let 'em hold me down to the ground I'm makin' it through 'cause I write the storySunlight was the only thing that felt right before I came here But inside it feels like it keeps raining And every drop is like the tears we couldn't cry Because inside we were all alone But this place gave us something, that somehow made us strong If there's a place inside this world Where hopes and dreams are not yet lost We'll stand and fight against these walls We'll fight this fight forevermore Sometimes I feel this anger changing slowly into A monster that keeps on creeping under And I don't think that I can take anymore I need you here like never before But can you hear me call If there's a place inside this world Where hopes and dreams are not yet lost We'll stand and fight against these walls We'll fight this fight forevermore If there's a place inside this world Where we must go back to once more Until the day we find that place We're not aloneOne step forward Two steps backwards Saving culture Killing art You want borders, we just want a bridge This is modern warfare, freedom in a ditch Will you ever bother listening Made in the land of the rising sun Decade in the rain, proving who we are Still under fire for the things we love Hey, just listen We are the side effects A product of love, a product of hate We are the side effects A product of heart, but make no mistake No one asked for your love No one asked for your hate So we ask from the heart Before it's too late, just let us be usSomeone told me Time will heal all the pain But no one told me It doesn't work the same When you fall in love Someone told me Love is just a game But no one told me I'd never play again Because she took my breath away When she said Stay I want you to know Every time you go I'm torn apart to pieces here alone So just stay You're the antidote You're my only hope Will you save me If I'm in need of help And will you hold me Until I feel the warmth Because you're the only one that Makes me feel alive When I'm with you I know That I will survive She said"6-6-1, report altitude Mayday, mayday, mayday, Pakistan 6-6-1 Sir, we've lost one engine Roger, Pakistan"Take what you got and
