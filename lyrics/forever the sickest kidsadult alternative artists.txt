She was into hardcore, I was into rock and roll She was into girls, it was her own form of birth control She was smoking cigarettes and drinking before five She was wild, she was fine with being hungover all the time Come on She was always at a party, disappointing daddy Always dating dirtbags, everyone but me she had Lyrics from her favorite song tattooed on her arm She was rough, she was fine, she was way out of her mind I love her like la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la I love her like la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la I love her like hate, I love her like pain I need her like a picnic needs the rain I love her like la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la She loved drinking whiskey, first thing in the morning She would start a fight if you looked at her the wrong way Every day was Halloween a reason to rebel She was wild, she was fine with being bitter all the timeI'm in love with a girl I hate She enjoys pointing out every bad thing about me I'm in love with a critic and a skeptic A traitor, I'd trade her in a second She's a backseat driver, a drama provider An instant update of the world She's a first class liar, a constant forgetter She's attractive, but bitter Did you scream enough to make her cry To turn around, turn around Baby, don't return to me If you think that I'm not worth your time She's a lady And ladies shouldn't be messed with She's a lady And ladies shouldn't be messed with Take off your shoes, come in the room And baby, let's try not to argue Turn out the lights, turn on the radio And how can we fight when I'm too busy loving you I'm too busy loving you, I'm too busy loving youHe was the man of every hour He was a party all alone He’d give his jacket to a stranger in the cold She was the beauty queen from Dallas She could put a lion on a leash And before he knew himself She knew the man that he could be It's never that easy, it never seems right When careful meets carefree And in just four minutes, they knew each other for life And he said"Alright, Nikki, it's alright, baby Tonight, you can let your hair down Alright, Nikki, it’s alright, baby Tonight, you can take a breath now If you only live once, stay in the clouds Never come down, trust me Alright, Nikki, it’s alright, baby Tonight, you can let your hair down"I candy coat and cover everything But I'm still hiding underneath It's been a long time, it's been a long time A thousand faces looking up at me Hands all pointing to the ceiling Oh, what a feeling I've got friends in highly low places I'm standing on post and I'm posted up Can't afford to lose them I've got friends in highly low places I'll go inside when I wanna party Grab a girl and dance Whoa oh  Whoa, whoa oh!Why do I put myself in these situations Whoa oh  Whoa, whoa oh!I keep pushing

alone So, where do we go  When you just have to fight to be aloneHey  Oh!Hey  Oh!I don't wanna waste my time again By getting wasted with so-called friends'Cause they don't know me But they pretend to be part of my social scenery And hey, maybe I'm a critic, a cynic Or am I jaded or am I afraid of it 'Cause it's dragging me down, it's bumming me out It's making my head spin round and round Can you say "Hey"  Can you say "Oh"?That's right, what do you want from me Can you say "Hey"  Can you say "Oh"?That's right, what do you want from me I get the feeling we're on to something I say "jump" and you start jumping Can you say "Hey"  Can you say "Oh"?That's that, now what do you want from me Just another day in the life for me It's three A M and I can't sleep And I've been thinking that we've been drinkin'In hopes to maintain our sanity And hey, maybe I'm a critic, a cynic Or am I crazy  Did they all hate me 'Cause they pick me up and throw me down It's makin' my head spin round and roundI'm two cups into my coffee break I'm sitting alone in the café front way Reading all by myself I'm turning my cell off just to breath'Cause everyone I know just keeps calling me And I just need a little time'Cause I've over-committed myself I guess this is growing up I'm sleeping so little, these days I guess this is growing up I'm feeling things are about to change I'm guessing this is growing up, yeah I'm guessing this is growing up And my mom hates my guts She has every reason to, for all the things I do And it breaks me just to know That I have torn her apart so many times, so many times'Cause I've over-committed myself I guess this is growing up I'm sleeping so little, these days I guess this is growing upYou may call me crazy, but that's alright with me Everyone I know swears that she's cheating on me I'm just a sucker that fell in love with a liar I'm flirting with danger, I'm playing with fire I know I could do better But better's just whatever When you find the one you love It doesn't matter if they tear you apart Taking shots with every guy at the bar Taking photos of herself top down in the back of my car I can't say that she doesn't get to me I can't say it doesn't rip right through me I know I could do better But better's just whatever When you find the one you love It doesn't matter if they tear you apart She hates me, but she wants me inside I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm playing with fire Cause she's out of her mind I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm playing with fire, playing with fire From the first time that I saw her I knew that I was in love Got her name tattooed Got the mark of the beast on my arm Down dirty likes to roll in the mud Got a thirst for sweat an insatiable hunger for bloodI should've known better not to wait around Why did I come home  I should've known better not to wait around I'm getting rid of my phone I should've known better not to wait around Never did, never did I ever love Anyone other than you But secretly, I always want to see you cry So I push you until you do I should've never came, I should've never Should've never came but you insisted for Me to Crossed the line, didn't mean to Take it back if I thought it'd make it work Never did, but I meant to, I, I, I give up I never did what you said that I did when I was gone for so long I never said what you did was either right or wrong It's wrong, you dreamt of himHey, you always seem to catch me when I'm lying About the stupidest of things Okay, you stand there while I stab you in the back With the words "I never, never, never should have taken this so far"Go ahead and buy yourself a drink'Cause you know you're deserving of it Go ahead and cry yourself to sleep And think how you hate me so bad Go ahead and cry yourself to sleep And think how you hate me so bad Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo doo Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo doo doo Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo doo Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo doo doo I could write about a thousand songs to impress you But I wouldn't want to do that I could make you feel like queen of the world, but I won't'Cause you're full of imperfections
