time Such a long time, and I miss you there I can't imagine bein' anywhere else I can't imagine bein' anywhere else but here How the hell did you ever pick me Honestly, I could sing you a song But I don't think words can express your beauty It's singing to me How the hell did we end up like this You bring out the beast in me I fell in love from the moment we kissed Since then, we've been history They say that love is forever Your forever is all that I need Please stay as long as you need Can't promise that things won't be broken But I swear that I will never leave Please stay forever with meIs there a right way for how this goes You've got your friends and you've got your foes They want a piece of somethin' hot Forget your name like they forgot Oh, ain't that somethin'?So when I see you crash and burn I criticize your every word I'm tryna keep from goin' insane Ain't that the way of this whole damn thing Oh, tryin' to be something more Nobody's gonna love you if You can't display a way to capture this Nobody's gonna hold your hand and guide you through No, it's up for you to understand Nobody's gonna feel your pain When all is done and it's time for you to walk away So when you have today You should say all that you have to say Say all that you have to say Is there a right way for bein' strong Feels like I'm doin' things all wrong Still, I'm here just holdin' on Confess my heart and forgive my wrongs Oh, just tryna show you somethin' moreShe says she wants to end it all when she's all alone in her room She cries The way she feels inside is too much for her When all you got is these four walls It's not that hard to feel so small Or even exist at all How come no one heard her when she said Maybe I'm better off dead If I was would it finally be enough To shut out all those voices in my head Maybe I'm better off dead Better off dead!Did you hear a word Hear a word I said This is not where I belong You're gonna miss me when I'm gone Gone, gone This is not where I belong You're gonna miss me when I'm gone She doesn't know she's beautiful Because no one's ever told her so And the demons that she has is all she knows And maybe she can fall in love with someone in her life that she could trust And tell her she's enough How come no one heard her when she saidLet’s hang the jury You sick judgemental fools I’ll bury you six feet deep So tired of your rules Fuck you and your opinion How could you be so blind What goes around Comes back around in time You don’t know shit You don’t know shit About me You don’t know shit shit shit Don’t know a god damn thing about me Keep looking down on me I am more than you’ll ever be Cut me deep but I won’t bleed Gonna kick kick Kick me when I’m down By all means Put me through hell And I’ll make you see I’ll be your worst enemy Try to kick kick kick me when I’m down Kick me when I’m downTrue friends lie underneath The witty words I don't believe I can't believe a damn thing they say anymore Lie  Lie  Liar!Liar, you'll pay for your sins Lie  Lie  Liar!Liar, you'll pay for your sins So tell me how does it feel How does it feel to be like you I think your mouth should be quiet'Cause it never tells the truth now So tell me, so tell me why Why does it have to be this way Why can't things ever change I'm falling over and over again From all the words that you have said It's written on my heart for everyone to see From the place I was, to the place I am, to the place I want to be From the mountains I've been climbing over and under and over So tell me how does it feel How does it feel to be like you I think your mouth should be quiet'Cause it never tells the truth now So tell me, so tell me why Why does it have to be this way Why can't things ever change Could you check my pulse for me to see if I'm alive 'Cause every time that I am near you is the only time I feel alright If there were any way I could think to turn back time I'd stay here with you Sometimes I sit and wonder, sometimes I feel like letting go All I know is no one should have to be alone I don't want to be alone I don't want to die alone I could fall apart here and now I don't want to die alone I want to be with you, you, you I only want to be with you, you, you Uh, uh, uh Tell me, what's the point of life, is it material Had everything I could ever want and probably more When I lay in bed at night, all I do is think of you So when all this is gone, what do I have to come home to This life goes by so fast, pretty soon, I'll grow old What would I have but some stories now that I have told No one to share them with, and when it's all done What am I left with  Tell me what's left When you look at my life, tell me, what do you see I'm only human, so don't expect too much from me I lost my faith, what have I become I don't think I can be safe from what I'm running from Will you remember me If I were to fall into the sky And what will they think of me If I leave it all behind When I leave it all behind Would you be so surprised if I gave up tonight I'm barely breathing, I wanna kill the pain I feel inside But I won't quit for the people I love So I'll say I'm fine until the day I fucking see the light Will you remember me If I were to fall into the sky And what will they think of me If I leave it all behind When I leave it all behind 1, 21,2,3 Stay for tonight If you want to I can show you What my dreams are made of As I'm dreaming of your face I've been away for a long time Such a long time And I miss you there I can't imagine being anywhere else I can't imagine being anywhere else but here How the hell did you ever pick me Honestly, cause I could sing you a song But I don't think words can express your beauty It's singing to me How the hell did we end up like this You bring out the beast in me I fell in love from the moment we kissed Since then we've been history They say that love is forever Your forever is all that I need Please stay as long as you need Can't promise that things won't be broken But I swear that I will never leave Please stay forever with meFather, father, tell me where have you been It's been hell not having you here I've been missing you so bad And you don't seem to care When I go to sleep at night, you're not there When I go to sleep at night, do you care Do you even miss us Your bottles, your mistress I need to know, I need to know Why are you walking away Was it something I did  Did I make a mistake 'Cause I'm trying to deal with the pain I don't understand this, is this how it ends I will try to understand Father, father, tell me where are you now It's been hell not having you Last thing I heard, you were fed up You're skipping town with no note telling where When I go to sleep at night, you're not there When I go to sleep at night,
