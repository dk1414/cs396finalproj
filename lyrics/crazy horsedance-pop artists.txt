new world And that palace in the sun On the shore lay Montezuma With his coca leaves and pearls In his halls, he often wandered With the secrets of the world And his subjects gathered 'round him Like the leaves around a tree In their clothes of many colors For the angry gods to see And the women all were beautiful And the men stood straight and strong They offered life in sacrifice So that others could go on Hate was just a legend And war was never known People worked together And they lifted many stones And they carried them to the flatlands But they died along the way And they built up with their bare hands What we still can't do today And I know she's living there And she loves me to this day I still can't remember when Or how I lost my way He came dancing across the water Cortez, Cortez What a killerLook out, Mama, there's a white boat coming up the river With a big red beacon and a flag and a man on the rail I think you'd better call John'Cause it don't look like they're here to deliver the mail And it's less than a mile away I hope they didn't come to stay It's got numbers on the side and a gun And it's makin' big waves Daddy's gone, my brother's out huntin' in the mountains Big John's been drinkin' since the river took Emmy Lou So the powers that be left me here to do the thinkin'And I just turned twenty-two I was wonderin' what to do The closer they got The more those feelings grew Daddy's rifle in my hand felt reassurin'He told me "Red means run, son, numbers add up to nothin'"But when the first shot hit the dock I saw it comin'Raised my rifle to my eye Never stopped to wonder why Then I saw black and my face splashed in the skyBe on my side, I'll be on your side, baby There is no reason for you to hide It's so hard for me staying here all alone When you could be taking me for a ride Yeah She could drag me over the rainbow And send me away Down by the river I shot my baby Down by the river Dead, ooh Shot her dead, ooh You take my hand, I'll take your hand Together we may get away This much madness is too much sorrow It's impossible to make it today Yeah, ooh, yeah She could drag me over the rainbow And send me away, yeahI wanna live with a cinnamon girl I could be happy the rest of my life With a cinnamon girl A dreamer of pictures, I run in the night You see us together, chasing the moonlight My cinnamon girl Ten silver saxes, a bass with a bow The drummer relaxes and waits between shows For his cinnamon girl A dreamer of pictures, I run in the night You see us together, chasing the moonlight My cinnamon girl Pa, send me money now I'm going to make it somehow I need another chance You see your baby loves to dance Yeah, yeah, yeahOnce I thought I saw you in a crowded hazy bar Dancing on the light from star to star Far across the moonbeam, I know that's who you are I saw your brown eyes turning once to fire You are like a hurricane There's calm in your eye And I'm getting blown away To somewhere safer where the feeling stays I want to love you but I'm getting blown away I am just a dreamer, but you are just a dream You could have been anyone to me Before that moment you touched my lips That perfect feeling when time just slips Away between us and our foggy trip You are like a hurricane There's calm in your eye And I'm getting blown away To somewhere safer where the feeling stays I want to love you but I'm getting blown awayI think I'd like to go back home and take it easy There's a woman that I'd like to get to know, living there Everybody seems to wonder what it's like down here I gotta get away from this day-to-day running around Everybody knows this is nowhere La la la, la la la la Everybody, everybody knows, everybody knows Oh yeah Every time I think about back home, it's cool and breezy I wish that I could be there right now just passing time Everybody seems to wonder what it's like down here I gotta get away from this day-to-day running around Everybody knows this is nowhere La la la, la la la la Everybody knows Everybody knows Everybody knows, everybody, everybody knows Oh yeah]Hello, cowgirl in the sand Is this place at your command Can I stay here for a while Can I see your sweet sweet smile Old enough now to change your name When so many love you is it the same It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game]Hello, ruby in the dust Has your band begun to rust After all the sin we've had I was hopin' that we turn back Old enough now to change your name When so many love you is it the same It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this gameEverybody's going out and having fun I'm a fool for staying home and having none I can't get over how she set me free Oh, lonesome me There must be some way that I can lose these lonesome blues Forget about the past, find someone new I've thought of everything from A to Z Oh, lonesome me I'll bet she's not like me She's out and fancy free Flirting with the boys with all her charms But I still love her so And brother, don't you know I'd welcome her right back here in my arms There must be some way that I can lose these lonesome blues Forget about my past, find someone new I can't get over how she set me free Oh, lonesome meHey hey, my my Rock and roll can never die There's more to the picture than meets the eye Hey hey, my my Out of the blue and into the black You pay for this, but they give you that
