Believe the news, I'm gone for good Call off the search No one will know that I'm down here And believe the note I left for you You can't turn back the clocks You can't pull me up from here, so don't try I'm in a car underwater with time to kill Thinking back I forgot to tell you this I didn't care that you left and abandoned me What hurts more is I would still die for you I'm in a car underwater with time to kill Thinking back I forgot to tell you this I didn't care that you left and abandoned me What hurts more is I would still die for you Make time slower, give me longer It's too late for me No one will know that I'm down here And believe your dreams of me sinking So far below You can't pull me up from here so don't tryWalked past my grave in the dark tonight Saw the stone and the note you left for me To answer your question: I just had to leave I just had to leave But that's not why I'm here I came down here to tell you It rains in heaven all day long I wanna find you so bad and let you know I'm miserable up here without you Miserable up here without you Found my way back in the dark tonight Couldn't wake up, not right next to you I'd trade in forever to just hear you say the sound of my name But that's not why I'm here I came down here to tell you It rains in heaven all day long I wanna find you so bad and let you know I'm miserable up here without you Miserable up here without youSo here's the truth You were right all along They were never my friends And I was living a lie But I won't fall for it next time You figured me out I'm like a leaf in the wind I try to find who I am But wind up lost in the end Sometimes it's hard to know what's real when you're not'Cause you know I change myself To impress whoever happens to be next to me But I'm sick of trying so hard Waste all your time with me I know I'm a mess right now Don't give up believe I'd wait it out for you Waste all your time with me I know I'm a mess right now Don't give up believe I'd wait it out for you Everyday I'm just making my rounds Just digging a hole six feet underground Sometimes it's hard to know what's real when you're notHold your own jacket please I'm not in the mood Millions of trains, under the ground This city was the blueprint for hell Passed out, sleeping at your party Dream of leaving in the morning You will all die in Williamsburg Too hip to even clean your nose out Your grave is pulling at your pants now You will all die in Williamsburg Bored again, watching the rats Eat all your food At least you'll be used to The place you'll be soon This city was the blueprint for hell Passed out, sleeping at your party Dream of leaving in the morning You will all die in Williamsburg Too hip to even clean your nose out Your grave is pulling at your pants now You will all die in Williamsburg Do you know how obvious you are You were born in New Hampshire but you say you're from the O CBrooklyn's a death bed, for clones of the same kid Stuck in a party that was lame to begin withI wanna live again I wanna start everything over again I wanna get this right I'll meet you in another life Over again I'm coming back around again Coming back over again I'm coming back around again But now it's over We're out of time and I can't breathe I told you not to believe in me'Cause all I do is push you far away from me All I do is push you far away from me Out of time and I can't breathe I told you not to believe in me'Cause all I do is push you far away from me All I do is push you far away from me I'm gonna make this work I'm gonna change everything wrong with me I'm gonna prove you wrong When I meet you in another life Over again I'm coming back around again Coming back over again I'm coming back around again But now it's overIt's funny how things work out The ones we need don't know we're there If I were sand and you were oceans The moon would be why you're pulled to me I wake up and think dreams are real I sleep so I don't have to feel The truth that you can't ever be The one person that won't ever forget me I hope that dreams come when I die So we can talk I won't wake up I'll ask you how your life worked out I'll never know that I'm just dreaming I wake up and think dreams are real I sleep so I don't have to feel The truth that you can't ever be The one person that won't ever forget me Let me sleep some more Let me sleep some more Let me sleep some more Let me sleep some more Let me sleep some more Let me sleep some more Let me sleep some more Let me sleep some moreI started looking out for myself today But then I stopped cause I don't care I'm feeling bored of feeling numb So now I'll stop cause I don't care I started looking out for myself today But then I stopped cause I don't care I'm feeling bored of feeling numb So now I'll stop cause I don't care So get it, get it, get it right I'm not holding on to a thing here Get it, get it, get it right I'm not holding on and I can't say no Holding your head up Is hard when you just want To stay on the ground To stay on the ground Holding your head up Is hard when you just want To stay on the ground To stay on the ground I started feeling bad for myself today But then I stopped cause I don't care I'm dreaming less and sleeping more But I sold my soul for the dream you stoleHolding my breath walking alone with you I get to hear your voice again If this is a dream maybe you'll stay with me Stay with me please stay with me This is where we met We're back here again Don't leave me alone Don't leave me alone I can't stand the way the world feels When I'm walking alone Can you please keep talking to me now Tell me all about your new friends And don't think I can't hear you now I'm listening I'm listening And this is where we met We're back here again Don't leave me alone Don't leave me alone I can't stand the way the world feels When I'm walking aloneNow I'm in your basement I'm laying low to keep out of your way I hear your footsteps Move the floorboards above my head I have my own routine now I'm keeping busy in my own way I'm learning ways to not feel Like I'm down here forever I hear your footsteps Move the floorboards above my head I hope you know that I'm down here Just for you I sang a song to you through the floor To reach you upstairs I thought I heard you call out for more I know that's crazy I'm pretty sure that I'm lost again It won't get through to you I won't get through I think I won't get through I'm gonna close my mouth now You don't need more noise in your life I miss you more than you know But I know time makes you move on I hear your footsteps Move the floorboards above my head I hope you know that I'm down here Just for youYou see me, do I look okay to you Give me your hand I'll shake it and shake it again I'll smile till my face falls off my head If it's good for you, It's good for me too What did I say Why do you give a shit They're trying to pry in to my brain but I'm gone I'm running down highways till I see your face I just need to see you now I just need to see you now And I don't care about anything else I don't care about anything else Their words are flying over my head I try and hear, but I'm somewhere else again You laugh and I smile back to humor you If it's good for you, it's good for me too What did I say Why do you give a shit They're trying to pry in to my brain but I'm gone I'm running down highways till I see your face I just need to see you now I just need to see you now And I don't care about anything else
