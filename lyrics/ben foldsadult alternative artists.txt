6:00am, day after Christmas I throw some clothes on in the dark The smell of cold, car seat is freezing The world is sleeping, I am numb Up the stairs to her apartment She is balled up on the couch Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte They're not home to find us out And we drive Now that I have found someone I'm feeling more alone Than I ever have before She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly They call her name at 7:30 I pace around the parking lot Then I walk down to buy her flowers And sell some gifts that I gotLet me tell y'all what it's like Being male, middle-class, and white It's a bitch if you don't believe Listen up to my new C DI got shit runnin' throught my brain It's so intense that I can't explain All alone in my white-boy pain Shake your booty while the band complains I'm rockin' the suburbs Just like Michael Jackson did I'm rockin' the suburbs Except that he was talented I'm rockin' the suburbs I take the checks and face the facts That some producer with computers fixes all my shitty tracks I'm pissed off, but I'm too polite When people break in the Mc Donald's line Mom and Dad you made me so uptight I'm gonna cuss on the mic tonightI must give the impression That I have the answers for everything You were so disappointed To see me unravel so easily It’s only change Only everything I know Even the things That seem still are still changing La-duh, la-duh, la-duh-duh, dah, dah, dah La-duh, la-duh-dah, dah-dah-dah-dah La-duh, la-duh, la-duh-duh, dah, dah, dah La-duh,

cars to work each day Hey, hey We're rockin' the suburbs Around the block just one more time We're rockin' the suburbs'Cause I can't tell which house is mine We're rockin' the suburbs We part the shades and face the facts They've got better-lookin' fescue Right across the cul-de-sac Hot real-estate rising stars Get-rich-quick seminars Soap opera magazines Forty-thousand-watt nativity scenes Don't freak about the smoke alarm Mom left the T V dinner onTake it easy, take it slow Oh Get on with the show That's what I know I woke in a cold sweat last night Seems what's been good for music Hasn't always been so good for the life I threw my phone in a pool In New Orleans Found the love of my life Again y'all knows what I means And I'll be back on your sofa in a puddle in a couple of weeks Oh yeah I can't tell what you're saying when you yell at the same time You could be telling me the story of your life Your life Is my malfunction so surprising because I always seem so stable

weeks Oh yeah Well I won't I won't I won't I won't blame New OrleansYou don't stop , you don't stop Follow me into the great unknown Where pink flamingos grow, diet soda flows And what you take

back my black T-shirtI wanna ask you:Do you ever sit and wonder It's so strange that we could be together for So long, and never know, never care What goes on in the other one's head Things I've felt but I've never said You said things that I never said So I'll say something that I should have said long ago: You don't know me at all You don't know me at all ]You could have just propped me up on the table like a mannequin Or a cardboard stand-up and paint me Any face that you wanted me to be seen We're damned by the existential moment where We saw the couple in the coma and It was we who were the cliche But we carried on anyway So, sure, I could just close my eyes Yeah, sure, trace and memorize But can you go back once you knowI must give the impression That I have the answers for everything You were so disappointed To see me unravel so easily It's only change It's only everything I know It's only change And I'm only changing La-duh, la-duh, la-duh-duh, dah, dah, dah La-duh,
