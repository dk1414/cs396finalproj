I hate the world today You're so good to me, I know, but I can't change Tried to tell you but you look at me like maybe I'm an angel underneath Innocent and sweet Yesterday I cried You must have been relieved to see the softer side I can understand how you'd be so confused I don't envy you I'm a little bit of everything all rolled into one I'm a bitch, I'm a lover I'm a child, I'm a mother I'm a sinner, I'm a saint I do not feel ashamed I'm your Hell, I'm your dream I'm nothing in between You know you wouldn't want it any other way So take me as I am This may mean you'll have to be a stronger man Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous And I'm going to extremes Tomorrow I will change and today won't mean a thingWe hit Starbucks, roll down the top It's the last time Carrie and I will drive to the beach Cause we think it's time to grow up Well, I've never been good at that I wanna live for today, I have such good intentions And my dreams are no less than that of yesterday Does anyone really know where we should go Meet me where we can dream, down by the river Everybody's got a dream, down by the sea Meet me where we can dream by the river Who knows where it may lead, yeah The radio's blasting and we're singing And I'm feeling unstoppable When did I let life become so damn hard Well, I'm heading to what dreams are made of I won't turn my back to the stars of yesterday Does anyone really know where we should go Meet me where we can dream, down by the river Everybody's got a dream, down by the sea Meet me where we can dream by the river Does anybody really know where we should go She doesn't have a face of fashion Just an ordinary look at best She walks into a room with passion Extraordinary from the rest It's not the way she wears her hair Not the make up on her face Facination of a Monalisa A mystery that can't be traced Every time she walks away Cool men just stop and cry While other kids were singing "Jesus Loves Me"She was listening to John Coltrane Always one foot left of centers Always one foot in the rain Her story unfolds Like wildflowers on a vine She never grows old She always on your mind Every time she walks away Cool men just stop and cryElectricity Eye to eye Hey don't I know you I can't speak Stripped my senses On the spot I've never been defenseless I can't even make sense of this You speak and I don't hear a word What would happen if we kissed Would your tongue slip past my lips Would you run away Would you stay Or would I melt into you Mouth to mouth Lust to lust Spontaneously combust Room is spinning Out of control You act like you didn't notice You brushed my hand Forbidden fruit Ring on my finger Your such a moral, moral man Would you throw it away, no question Will I pretend I'm innocent I need some good luck I need a best friend I need a rough dog I need a mountain I need some new clothes, a T V, a cause A trip to nirvana The thrill of applause I need a wet kiss I need to confess I need a vision, religion The right to be silent And then to be heard A week on an island A diet that works I need a dose of the Bible Another course of survival Just talking 'bout the essentials To make me feel alive That's all I need See how easy I am to please That's all I need See how easy I am I need some money, more money and more time A strong cup of coffee A haircut, a lifeline A stranger to trust me My father to love me Seattle, a sunburn And lots of Todd Rundgren I need a guitar To do it on all fours Cool friends, weekends and someone to die forWashed my hands of crimes Pour the water over my skin, my spine Cleans my soul and ease my mind I've been fixed all the damage done Why do I always forget how far I've come I'm done dying for the past I'm done dying for the past Sins all forgiven now Let's call it even shall we Can't you judge me for my love And not mistakes I've made I swear by who I am and not by yesterday I'm done dying for the past I'm done dying for the last time The last time, the last time, the last time In between black and white I disappear Circled around the stone until I landed here I'm done dying for the past I'm done dying for the past I'm done dying I'm done for the last timeWhen's your birthday What's your middle name Who's youre hero What's your favorite flavor ice-cream Can you tell me, tell me this Are you Aries Are you on the cusp of Cancer Gonna get to know you

spend your millions Hey, no pressure, you've got time Just don't make me waitSomedays it goes your way Your on a road you can't explain And then it all goes down the drain Your cat's hit by a car The A TM eats you card You're wondering what changed from yesterday Save me from- from going mental Save me from just spinning out Somedays are better than others Somedays you just can't figure out Somedays you can't explain My best friend and me one night Were drinking peace on crescent height Just like that we end up in a fight Like a yo-yo up and down You're heading north You end up south Save me from- from going mental Save me from just spinning out Somedays are better than others Somedays you just can't figure out Somedays are better than others You can't explain somedays away SomedayBaby, what is wrong with you Can't you see I want you around And baby...I'm not cryin'I'm just dyin' for some touch And if you don't give me your attention I'll get attention from somebody else I don't know what your intentions are I have no patience to be put on the shelf Mmm baby You say you love me Then you don't even know if I'm around And baby If you're not lying Then keep trying or I'll be gone And if you don't give me your attention I'll get attention from somebody else I don't know what your intentions are I have no patience to be put on the shelf Baby, if you show me now There may still be time To change my heart But baby If you don't need me You'll both leave me When your cryin' startsYou were my wild companion We were forever high high high We burned the night around us Sleeping could wait until we die You were the scars of passion And since the crashing came You've broken every promise I walked away I watched you fall I was blind to ya Was lying to ya Like everyone else who watched you fall Say they love you but they're laughing when you crawl It's such a weary feeling When you've been stealing from yourself Wishing the world away Blaming someone else No one can do this for you Straighten you hair Fix your face Take all the pain inside you wash it away I watched you fall I was blind to ya Was lying to ya Like everybody else who watched you fall Say they love you but they're laughing when you crawl
