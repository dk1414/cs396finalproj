I went up to the mountain Because you asked me to Up over the clouds To where the sky was blue I could see all around me Everywhere I could see all around me Everywhere Sometimes I feel like I've never been nothing but tired And I'll be walking Till the day I expire Sometimes I lay down No more can I do But then I go on again Because you ask me to Some days I look down Afraid I will fall And though the sun shines I see nothing at all Then I hear your sweet voice, oh Oh, come and then go, come and then go Telling me softly You love me so The peaceful valley Just over the mountainMary You're covered in roses You're covered in ashes You're covered in rain You're covered in babies Covered in slashes Covered in wilderness You're covered in stains You cast aside the sheets You cast aside the shroud Of another man Who served the world proud And you greet another son And you lose another one On some sunny day And always you stay Mary Jesus said, mother, I couldn't stay another day longer He flies right by and leaves a kiss upon her face While the angels were singing his praises in a blaze of glory Mary stays behind and starts cleaning up the place Oh Mary She moves behind me She leaves her fingerprints Everywhere Every time the snow drifts Every way the sand shifts Even when the night lifts She's always thereIsn't she a river She doesn’t need a diamond to shine You can't really have her But you can hold her for a time Takes an army just to bend her Be careful where you stand her You can't hold her back for long The river is just too strong She’s a river Arms made out of silver Moving in a crooked line Carrying some dreamer Off into the end of time You don't need to save her Or teach her to behave Just let her on some line Ever-changing and undefined She's a river You can ride easy when she's slow Run across her when she low Follow wherever she goes She's a river Run for cover when she's mad Drown in her tears when days are bad Don't you ever forget it though She's a riverI'm gonna miss you when you're gone I know you don't believe that, but you're wrong There's gonna be some rainy Sundays Wishing one day, I'll see you again Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself But I know you're headed somewhere else And all the secrets that you keep will be the things I'll never know Doesn't matter either way, I'll still miss you when you go I'm gonna miss you when you're gone I know you don't believe that, you're wrong There's gonna be some strangers laughing through the hotel walls And I'm gonna wish your footsteps would come walking down the hall And the moon will be high, bright as a pearl Shining through my window on the dark side of the world And I'll be thinking of you, dancin' somewhere The way you were back then with the moonlight in your hair And I'm gonna miss you when you're gone I know you don't believe that, you're wrong There's gonna be some rainy Sundays Wishing one day I'll see you again That I'll see you againHe encontrado en tu amor La fe perdida Es por eso que mi vida tiene una razon No se si fue el embrujo de tus ojos Que le dijo a tus labios Robale el corazon Por todos los mil besos Que te he dado en la boca Se me fue el corazon Si dicen que es pecado Querer como te quiero Quiazs tengan razon Pero que ha de importarme Todo lo que me digan Sin no temo olvidar Si es pecado amarte Yo seguire pecando Por que lo he de negar Te seguire queriendo Te seguire adorando Aunque me vuelva loca Hasta que me devuelvas El corazon que en besos Yo te deje en la bocaI'm gonna let it be the field The one that rain forgot I'm gonna let it be the summer I'm gonna let it be your face The one that ran away I'm gonna let it be forever I'm gonna let it rain and hail Let the rusty nail No longer hold this world together I'm gonna let it be the sun In more ways than one Shine a different way tomorrow Shine a different way tomorrow I'm gonna let it be the moon Let it play the tune The one that keeps repeating I'm gonna let it be your will Let it have your thrill If that's what you are needing I'm gonna let it start again Gonna let it chase the wind With my arms stretched out before me Gonna let it look at me As I am sleeping in the dark And love me like a babyI met a little girl and I settled down In a little house out on the edge of town We got married, swore we'd never part Then little by little we drifted from each other's hearts At first I thought it was just restlessness That would fade as time went by and our love grew deep In the end it was something more I guess Tore us apart and made us weep I'm driving a stolen car Down on Eldridge Avenue Each night I wait to get caught But I never do She asked if I remembered the letters I wrote When our love was young and bold She said last night she read those letters And they made her feel one hundred years old I'm driving a stolen car On a pitch-black night And I'm telling myself It's going to be all right I drive by night And I travel in fear That in this darkness I will disappearPlease don't let me die in Florida I don't care about my name If you catch me dying in Daytona Roll my bed on to a train I was born in Indian summer In the south end long ago And those dirty streets cried out for rain And this is what I know And the rains came and they only stopped Just in time for snow And the icy cold filled up my shoes And this is what I know Please don't let me die in Florida I don't care about my name If you catch me dying in Orlando Roll my bed on to a train Well I went to war to fight the Japs When the war was over, I threw my cap Just as far as you could throw a thing I went home and gave my girl a ringYou can go wherever you wanna go Go wherever you wanna go Fly up to the moon and say hello now You can go wherever you wanna go You don't ever have to go to war no more Never have to go to war no more Wear them boots or swim that icy shore now You don't ever have to go to war no more You can get up on some sunny day and run Run a hundred miles just for fun now Heartaches and yesterdays don't weigh a ton now You can get up on some sunny day and run You don't ever have to pay the bills no more Break a sweat or walk a worried floor now Working like a dog ain't what you're for now You don't ever have to pay the bills no more You can go wherever you wanna go You can go wherever you wanna go Go to where the time's wound all the way down Put a penny on the track and wait for train sounds Tell your ma you're coming back before the sun's down You can go wherever you wanna goI wished I was smarter I wished I was stronger I wished I loved Jesus The way my wife does I wish it had been easier Instead of any longer I wished I could have stood Where you would have been proud But that won't happen now That won't happen now There's a whole lot of singing that's never going to be heard Disappearing everyday without so much as a word somehow Think I broke the wings off that little song bird She's never gonna fly to the top of the world right now Top of the world I don't have to answer any of these questions Don't have no God to teach me no lessons I come home in the evening Sit in my chair One night they called me for supper But I never got up I stayed right there in my chair
