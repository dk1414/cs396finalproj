Ooh, whoa, whoa Oh, oh I hung up the phone tonight Something happened for the first time Deep inside, it was a rush, what a rush 'Cause the possibility That you would ever feel the same way about me Just too much, just too much Why do I keep running from the truth All I ever think about is you You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized And I just got to know Do you ever think when you're all alone All that we can be, where this thing can go Am I crazy or falling in love Is it real or just another crush Do you catch a breath when I look at you Are you holding back like the way you do 'Cause I've tried and tried to walk away But I know this crush ain't going away Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Going away Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahWhoa, whoa, oh Whoa, oh Whoa, whoa, oh Whoa, oh Whoa, whoa, oh Whoa, oh When I saw you over there, I didn't mean to stare But my mind was everywhere, I wanna know you Gonna guess that you're the kind to say what's on your mind But you listen when I have something to show you There's a mark above your eye, you got it in July Fightin' for your sister's reputation You remember people's names and valentines are lame So I bring you flowers just for no occasion, oh Whoa, whoa, oh Whoa, oh, I wanna know you Whoa, whoa, oh Whoa, oh, I wanna go there where you go I wanna find out what you know And maybe someday down the road I'll sit back and say to myself, "Yeah, I thought so"There are times when you might feel aimless You can't see the places where you belong But you will find that there is a purpose It's been there within you all along and when you're near it You can almost hear it It's like a symphony just keep listenin'And pretty soon you'll start to figure out your part Everyone plays a piece and there are melodies In each one of us, oh, it's glorious You will know how to let it ring out as you discover who you are Others around you will start to wake up To the sounds that are in their hearts It's so amazin', what we're all creatin'It's like a symphony just keep listenin'And pretty soon you'll start to figure out your part Everyone plays a piece and there are melodies In each one of us, oh, it's glorious And as you feel the notes build You will seeI started a war I sent out a battle cry And I've been here before Fighting me, myself, and I When I try to prove that I'm never gonna lose I push too hard, I push too far Try to be brave 'til it's more than I can take So many times 'til I realize Take a breath Look at how you're tryna think it to death If you're in the crossfire, don't forget That you don't have to be invincible Take a step Even if you fall, it ain't over yet If you're in the crossfire, don't forget That you don't have to be invincible Oh-oh-ohhhhhh Oh-oh-ohhhhhh Oh-oh-ohhhhhh Oh-oh-ohhhhhh I counted to ten I stepped back so I could see How bad it can get When I'm the enemy I put my weapons down until I found A better way, a better way I'll never change if I'm too afraid to break Got to let it go, let the whole world know toI am knocking, standing at your door Somewhere new I've never been before Take me in and it feels like home It's getting late and I don't wanna go Something simple in the way this feels Like love is, something pure and real It's getting late and I have to leave But tonight your memory is holding me All these feelings inside, keeping me up all night All these feelings inside All these feelings inside, keeping me up all night Pictures that cross my mind They keeping me up all night They keeping me up all night They keeping me up all night Keeping me up all night Hear my heart, and there's an answered prayer Feel the magic in the midnight air Breathe it in, I wanna pass it on The strength of fighting somewhere you belongOoh-oh You never cross my mind at all It's what I tell myself What we had has come and gone You're better off with someone else It's for the best, I know it is But I see you Sometimes I try to hide What I feel inside And I turn around You're with him now I just can't figure it out Tell me why you're so hard to forget Don't remind me, I'm not over it Tell me why I can't seem to face the truth I'm just a little too not over youI think I’ll take a second chance I won’t be passing by these waters again Wanna feel redemption’s hand And see this life only for what it is I know the river’s not too wide Had to see it for myself with my own eyes Someone out there’s on my side It’s not my place to question why Everybody needs time away To wake up with the sun on their face I’m not there yet but I know I don’t wanna feel numb Falling over all of my shadows Yeah, I’m all done'Cause none of that ever really mattered It hurts to live so wide awake, oh But it’s a chance I can take I won’t run run run'Cause I don’t wanna feel numb So deep inside these hills I run to a place where I can see 'til kingdom come See the days one by one And love this life only for what it, what it is I hear the whispers in the stars The words that tell us more of who we are Someone out there’s not that far Everything I need is here nowYour heart is like a map of scars But it still carries the love The pen and papers in your hands Catchin’ all that you think of Throw your words into the world What you feel, and you’ll be heard Postcards in the sky Sayin’ what’s inside Hopin’ it will fly away And find a way to you Postcards in the sky Hopin’ it will fly away And find a way to Love, dreams, hope, peace Life, that’s all we had That’s all we had Love, dreams, hope, peace Life, that’s all we had That’s all we had Fear is only love turned cold Just a thought can change it back One move is all it really takes Then you’ll see how life reactsLook what the time has come to rewind We're back to where we began The autumn leaves have dropped to our knees I don't think I can do it again The winter winds can blow, but you and I both know This doesn't have to end I never wanted to ask for this I never did, I never did There must be some kind of reason We keep changing through the seasons It gets harder to believe in The reasons why we start when we just Break each other's hearts all over All over I wish that I could stop the ticking of this clock I'd keep you right here with me We'll never make it far if we're just frozen hearts When we're so close to spring, ohThere is a beacon You might not see the light on Look up ahead‘Cause somebody has the light on And you might not know It’s leading you home So many faces Thousands of places you’ll go You can lose faith Or run out of strength Oh, I know But don’t give up hope Don’t give up hope Shine a light Shine a light on your problems Don’t let the worries ever bring you down Look up ahead You’re gonna solve 'em The good is never gone It’s the dark before the dawn Shine the light
