I'm drunk off your kiss For another night in a row This is becoming too routine for me But I didn't mean to lead you on And it's alright to pretend That we still talk It's just for show, isn't it It's my fault that it fell apart Just maybe you need this And I didn't mean to Lead you on You were everything I wanted But I just can't finish what I've started There's no room left here on my back It was damaged long ago Though you swear that you are true I'd still pick my friends over you My friends over youIf you’ve ever been in love Or ever hope to be in love Here’s a story you’ll love with all your heart Couples on their backs in the park Lay on blankets bought On a date the day before A routine I’ve been longing for Can’t help but to glance From the corner of my resentful eyes Guess it’s all perspective but It’s you I never get enough We’re always far apart We’ve got a vicious love We mix our tears with blood No clock will stop for us It ticks by We fight as hard as we love We’ve got a vicious love When I go out alone And see them sharing meals Like Lady and the Tramp Hate their loving eyes Wishing it was you and I Add tip to my receipt Fold it up behind a picture of us Guess it’s all perspective but Together though we rarely touch Hard not to fall apartYou're hidin' something, 'cause it's burning through your eyes I try to get it out, but all I hear from you are lies And I can tell you're going through the motions Figured you were actin' out your part Once again, we're playing off emotion Which one of us will burn until the end Catalyst, you insist to pull me down You contradict the fact that you still want me around And it's all downhill from here And it's all downhill from here Your good intentions slowly turn to bitterness Recurring episodes with each and every kiss And I can tell you're going through the motions Figured you were actin' out your part Once again, we're playing off emotion Which one of us will burn until the end I must be honest Under the surface It grinds like a blender The sound of two voices My heart seems to fail me It put me in a stranger's bed It hurt who I love the most I'll never trust it again That's why I don't want what I want'Cause what I want, it just might kill me And I won't think of my needs'Cause what I need, I know there's never enough for me Envy is endless I used to put mistakes up on a board Compare how mine sticks Next to the rest of the worlds'That got me nowhere but miles from changing Now I've got deep stains And bleach won't erase them That's why I don't want what I want'Cause what I want, it just might kill me And I won't think of my needs'Cause what I need, I know there's never enough for meLiving for the weekend state of mind Makes me sick Just thinking of the bad habits People passing out in parking lots That you only live once way of thinking It’s so twisted are you living or just wasted An escape 'cause you can’t face it If a psycho said this is the end I think I’d believe him Now the whole world is full of it Building a bunker and jumping in After everyone self-destructs Pop the hatch and we’ll climb back up Now the whole world is full of it Building a bunker and jumping in After everyone self-destructs Pop the hatch and we’ll climb back up Back up This self-centered generation taking pictures Of themselves then changing features Pleasing over critical creatures Everyones got a cause but how strong is the foundation Moving like the waves of the ocean Do you care or just throw stones in I'm sick of smiling And so is my jaw Can't you see my front is crumbling down I'm sick of being someone I'm not Please get me out of this slump I'm sick of clapping When I know I can do it better for myself I'm sick of waiting Sick of all these words that will never matter I'll wire these nerves together Hoping for a chance to think on time And I'm tracing over your letter To see if your intentions are as good as mine But you're getting worse I swear it It's hard to prove you're an understatement You're getting worse and I know That you'll be calling, calling, calling me again I'm done with everything That had to do with you Don't worry your pictures are already burned I'm done with new friends Don't sell yourself short You'll lose it in the endThe needle on my record player has been wearing thin This record has been playing since the day you've been with him No more long rides home No more of your station I didn't like it anyways Remember the time we wrote our names upon the wall Remember the time we realized "Thriller" was our favorite song Have I waited too long Have I found that someone Have I waited too long to see you Have I waited too long Have I found that someone Have I waited too long to see you Maybe it's for the best Maybe it's not for anything It wouldn't be so bad to take this right from me No more long rides home No more of your station I didn't like it anyways Remember the time we wrote our names upon the wall Remember the time we realized "Thriller" was our favorite songIt's a barren land, but they all throw shade I can't make peace, post-modern age I'm a tourist lost in translation And there's nothing new under the sun You see, I like it so much better when I'm safe inside And at times your good company is hard to find To keep a nourished mind, I need water I'm trapped in another boring summer While everyone is living it up But it's way too hot to go outside When I don't relate to anyone In another boring summer While everyone is living it up But it's way too hot to go outside When I don't relate to anyone Call me anti-social It's more than I could hope for I'm not a star of stage and screen I don't know lines, but you make a scene I'm an alien crashed in an old west town Beam me up, get me out You see, I like it so much better when I'm safe inside Even though I know my reputation's on the line To keep a nourished mind, I need waterLet's go!The needle on my record player has been wearing thin This record has been playing since the day you've been with him No more long rides home No more of your station I didn't like it anyway Remember the time we wrote our names up on the wall Remember the time we realized "Thriller" was our favorite song Have I waited too long Have I found that someone Have I waited too long, to see you Have I waited too long Have I found that someone Have I waited too long, to see you Maybe it's for the best Maybe it's not for anything It wouldn't be so bad to take this right from meI'm sorry I heard about the bad news today A crowd of people around you Telling you it's okay And everything happens for a reason When you lose a part of yourself To somebody you know It takes a lot to let go Every breath that you remember Pictures fade away but memory is forever An empty chair at all the tables And I'll be seeing you when all my days boil down But it's better where you're going anyway I'm sorry I heard about the bad news today It's really hard to get through Tough times and long days But it really just depends on the season
