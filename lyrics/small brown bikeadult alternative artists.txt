As far as this winter goes we don't feel the deep snow But it's cold wherever I go, it feels cold wherever I go The smell of the heater core warms up the cold car as we climb the hand north The sound of the northern air warns us it's too far but it's a risk We must care it's a bridge we must bear The sight of your face again completes the long drive one of the four reasons why it feels whole to be alive Brother gone north please come home to stay brother gone north, make this a holidayHe said just to let him go  no ropes attached  this is how he wants it  this is how we want it  im holding back my tears  my throat is dirt  the four of us  time to discuss  what will we do in thirty years  is it this weather  have the clouds ran down inside your head  soaked in cynicism  you dry me up  the time is always green  the eyes all squint  it comes out red and blistered  screaming for completion  when time stares back  let the sun kill you  when time stares back  let your son live you  take care of meDriving and the same humming noise drives through my head  radio barely working now  circle of five hardly any involvement  i dont know if i can listen to this anymore  focus my attention on tv never lose color  i wonder if theres a neighbor who can lend a helping hand  theres a block party on my floor only three of us showed  and none of us were invited for the twenty-sixth floorI'm here for now and everyone went left You're here with all of my strings attatched Count down all of my remaining days Dead sense in my head and this chest pain that i can't take If i could see you  If i was with you You could destroy me But never completely I hold the distance to my head And whisper to myself, "It's fine."This road is really not so far With my head in a vice as i reach for my safety line This stretch is like murder I reach too far, pull out my heart I want to give it away I reach too far, and play my part Now you see me, and now i'm a shadowI'm crawling down the pavement Everything streams by Everyone screams by On the trip back home, I wasn't sure if I was going to make it We crush what's coming We can't recover We leave what's empty and move down the line Everything has made me bitter I coughed up a smile tonight I brought home a fake badge to wear around the house And show my loved ones how much I try I've killed what's missing The pavement is peeling We've lost what's broken and saved each otherDriving through your childhood And all the stories that youve told me since we first met I get the feeling that You're forgetting to tell me what you're trying to forget As we walk across the park On the iced over grass you start to talk about all the times when And all the nights when And the underneath us breaking like glass This is the park where you fell asleep, and couldn't tell if it was a dream When you opened your eyes and saw the man hiding in the trees This is the street where the woman died, she had the problem of being too sweet And how naive of me to think I couldn't get homesick in a week All the sweethearts here They litter the streets, the liberal and artistic minds They walk hand and hand And kiss each others cheeks when they meet They have got everything In common and the conversations never stop They've all got The one about "running all night from the campus cops."But behind the trees at the overpass- A girl was once crushed by a train Running to catch up with her friends, Her life turned into one day And the town carries on- and the town heals with time Everyone tries so hard to chase these ghosts from their mind And how naive of me to think That I couldn't get homesick in a week It starts to snow As the quartet down the street Warms up the strings I'm in the wrong hometown-It feels like its time to leave I'm in the wrong hometown for Christmas EveEverything was so dead still  The air just froze and broke  Those few words that you said to you  They had no place to go, but to our minds, to our hearts and the torture wasn't marked  Now I've found that you hated our lives  I just think it through sometimes and get nowhere, but lost  I can't help but miss those things that we found through our talks  Now we don't laugh and we don't sing and I can't understand a thing  And the thirds and the fifths are all gone   Don't be my unsung zero   Don't be my unsung zero   Don't be my unsung zero  I don't want to chase the past  It feels like finding ghosts  You seem to have your mind set up  It's creeping from our home  We don't talk and we don't call in this manufactured war where I can't even aim with my eyes  Now that we've closed that door  Hugged and stepped away  Thank you from my heart  With one last thing to say  I miss our lifeI miss myself more than anything  I can't go back to where I can be seen  No, not tonight  Sometimes I feel like I stayed home and slept  No one is here and my progress goes unchecked, but on this night  I can't lift this up  I wander through these blank landscapes  Searching I want to reach back  I want to return home now  I can see you standing there  I can feel me falling here  The sleep I took tonight was stolen from ghosts who haunt and I can't control them, No, not tonight  They make me feel like I'm just stalling out  I'm not the one and my fears are falling now, but on this night  I can't lift this upLate night drive-putting myself in control the first time And if this car doesn't kill me tonight, I know that I must be blessed I know that I'll be all right I know that I'll live my life exactly as I like and I'll be just fine Unless, of course, I'm riding with death Yesterday I rode with death, its not quite as it seems For many, many months this was my reality Today its only a dream Late night drive-putting myself in control for the first time And if I survive, I know that I must be right There will be green grass, and deep blue skies, pink moons, and red, red wine rewarding me for my honest try I know that I'll live my life exactly as I like and I'll be just fine Unless, of course, I'm riding with death Yesterday I rode with death, its not quite as it seems For many, many months this was my reality Today its only a dream Yesterday I rode with death, its not quite as it seems For many, many months this was my reality Today its only a dreamWe bury ourselves alive in a cold, steel van This pain isn't getting better The cities, they haven't changed I'm not the same Because of one and each other, we stay together This silence is getting scary The people, they haven't changed, I've changed Deconstruct this love, replace this time Rebuild or nail yourself to the ground The blinder I am, the better I think that I am The songs that are playing are still too loud Tiring myself from these walls that I tore to the ground, drown We destroy ourselves at night and we fall apart Just like every magazine stand, we try to find the right words Just a telephone call, it makes things better So I stare out the window and I wish that I was alive
