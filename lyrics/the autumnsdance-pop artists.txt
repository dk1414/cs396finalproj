Where the garden ends Scars never meant Make a wish for me at the olive tree Break the poison hearts Bathed in light of stars Blood is precious not to be left in the Rain Is gonna come down hard And I lied when I said that part Ash Is all I've got And I lied when I sunk your heart Feel the hands of shame Clutch and bleed the frame Violets whisper about my sister The rain Is gonna come down hard And I lied when I said that part Ash Is all I've got And I lied when I sunk your heartJust a thought I cannot say when I’ve felt content again my love I’ve often dreamt I'm in need again Take a look Iridescent light Is shining on me bright my love And forcing tears into my eyes Slow won't you come my way Strewn marigolds all line the way It's never been so mild Frozen in summer's wake Come now it's over Prayers I don't wanna pray I feel the air grow numb I don't feel this way As I've read Of Alice Carroll wrote Curious finds what it seeks Older yes knowing nothing stillSoft dripping glades Sifting palisades Of winter's chilling whispers She's drifting seen Waning in her dreams Dull crescent, evanescent You're shivering Soft spoken thin blue light Smears your pale face Frost cold gleam Her fingers trace Gently on my face My white-gowned, sinful still sound In frostwork sear Hold me ever near Delicately, quelling quickly You're shivering Soft spoken thin blue light Smears your pale face Frost cold gleamI cast a line Of Silverton Over the sea Bale mirror shines Of angel's pine And soc scents of London is falling London is falling over me I see the light Poured as gold Down through the trees High in the night Shivered chrome Godsent to London is falling London is falling over me Lime little eyes Knead and gore Pale babes in spring Crawl through the crust To summer’s door Godspeed toSwoon and wane In this wild amber rain Stale sunlight peels the skin to see Hold out This time The air is blind In the stillborn light Spill yourself, I'll fill your mind When I close my eyes Trip wild-eyed Through my heart’s poison ides This is the splendor I'll divorce and scorn Hold out This time The air is blind In the stillborn light Spill yourself, I'll fill your mind When I close my eyesAs dripping as orphans Return bluely nocturne flowers Fear you're so dear to The sun In bracelets of glass eyes Pain and sorrow mount to kiss These moon rings and green things In love Outside All your smeared olive tears Outside All is clearly woven Entangled and hanging Spiders’ spines grind wax fingers to Smoke angels fallen To blue Outside All your smeared olive tears Outside All is clearly woven In mud and broken No No No NoThrow down The sea floor's itching for an anchor Begging for a death show Come on through the window I know You'll never secrets keep Slow down the hall we'll creep To fall black clowns from gallows' heights Now Even now Now We can wild and sad Creeping smiling sad Pulling out your hair Hair Throw down I knew you'd hang like meat from a hook Dripping out the life in Blood and grenadine When I knowWords softly spoken And dim the lamplight Flame unlit carries Away my late fright The fire gone out Flame dance diminished With dawn approaching Our hour unfinished Illuminating glitters of a star-kissed morning Her song of rest Drops of dew are now forming So dismal yet delightful Dreary and frightful Her song is insightful Put me at ease I’ve tasted her words Bitter on my tongue I’ve twisted her words In poetry unsung Whisper those thoughts Heard and implored Let your voice string out Chord upon chordHold out your hand Palms to me Reach forth So frail part of me It’s sad to say but true It’s sad to say but true It’s sad to say but true It’s sad to say but true Sleep tight My heart is on your sleeve Tonight I’ve tried but could not wait It’s sad to say but true It’s sad to say but true It’s sad to say but true It’s sad to say but true Low do How do you sleep How do you sleep tonight Low do How do you sleep How do you even breathe This breeze sways the trees Over my head Chills my rainswept skin The winter will rule O’er my foul moods Left cold and upset Embrace me and hold me Speak in soft worldly tones And hold me don't leave me Til the sun warms my bones This breeze sways the trees Over my head Chills my rainswept skin I know that the clouds Will soon pass on by Rays of warmth in the sky
