The strands in your eyes that color them wonderful Stop me and steal my breath And emeralds from mountains that thrust towards the sky Never revealing their depth And tell me that we belong together Dress it up with the trappings of love I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above I'll be your cryin' shoulder I'll be love's suicide And I'll be better when I'm older I'll be the greatest fan of your life And rain falls angry on the tin roof As we lie awake in my bed And you're my survival, you're my living proof My love is alive and not dead And tell me that we belong together Dress it up with the trappings of love I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from aboveLying here with you Listening to the rain Smiling just to see The smile upon your face And these are the moments I thank God that I'm alive And these are the moments I'll remember all my life I've found all I've waited for And I could not ask for more Looking in your eyes Seeing all I need Everything you are Is everything in me And these are the moments I know Heaven must exist And these are the moments I know all I need is this I've found all I've waited for, yeah And I could not ask for more I could not ask for more than this time together I could not ask for more than this time with you And every prayer has been answered And every dream I've had's come true Yeah, right here in this moment Is right where I'm meant to be Oh, here with you, here with me, oh Yeah, oh yeah Oh yeahI’ve seen a love that rolls like thunder I’ve seen a love that falls like rain That kind of love it makes me wonder Why my love causes me so much pain I see my ring as it spins on the table A perfect circle on the dusty wood Tells of a life, the love and the laughter Cries my tears for the times that were good I’ve seen a love that rolls like thunder I’ve seen a love that falls like rain That kind of love it makes me wonder Why my love causes me so much pain One gets lost, one gets lonely In another world love remains That kind of love takes away all your empty That kind of love takes away all your shame I've seen a love that rolls like thunder I've seen a love that falls like rain That kind of love it makes me wonder Why my love causes me so much pain And our kind of love it burns like summer Like I'm rolling down some old heartache road And all my running and my demons Can't seem to lift it Can't seem to lift that loveOl' Babe Ruth, he was a drunkard just like me He lived it high, and he lived it low Staggered down the New York streets They throw him out the pub, when he raised a little too much hell And then he lay his big fat head down at the Gramercy park hotel The Gramercy park hotel All these hit men, look like organ grinders to me Rock stars on golden chains, little monkeys dancin' round their feet Well give me a little hat, little vest, and a little monkey bell And send my bananas baby to the Gramercy park hotel The Gramercy Park Hotel And all the publicists sing La di da di da da, La di da di da da, La di da di da da La di da di da da, La di da di da da, La di da di da da La di da di da da, La di da di da da, La di da di da da And its so far gone And its so far gone Maybe this is just a beggars life, and maybe its all dream Maybe its just about kindness I should forget all my silly schemes Maybe I'm just a fool, but my fool shoes fit so well Snuggled up in my big fool blanket at the Gramercy Park HotelAl, he sells records down on old St  Charley's Street He's cleaning up Fat Tuesday's mess he keeps the sidewalks neat And he just lost his father ya know he just lost his wife And if it wasn't for the music he couldn't get on with his life Chorus And he knows what I know It's not all that hard to survive You take the good and the bad and the time in between It lets us know We're alive Well now Be Be's singing gospel And down on Bourbon she sings the blues She plays on all my heart strings curls my toes up in my shoes And she knows what I'm after Chase my dreams with all my might She says you shouldn't be so anxious and deep down I know she's right Chorus Well get on board the rocket Step right into the front car You know life's a roller coaster It ain't got no safety bar Raise your voices up with laughter Bring it in with one big sigh Consecrated in the wonder ...  we're aliveMidnight in the Holy City Playground for restless souls Graveyards for the sons of Fort Sumpter And the ghostly daughters Wait for their boys to come home Moonlight in the Holy City So thick it warms the air I burned my heart on a sweet southern flame Like a hug from your mama saying it will be okay Spilled my blood, in the Holy City Seen the flood of a thousand rains Ran away from the Holy City Heard the spirits in the steeple singing You'll be back again, you'll be back, brother Sunrise in the Holy City The kings and queens shuffle by I'm born here of my own ashes Just lay me down there when I die Spilled my blood, in the Holy City Seen the flood of a thousand rains I ran away from the Holy City Heard the spirits in the steeple singing You'll be back You'll be back again somedayIt's 3:00 A MAnd I'm awake and my heart still dreaming It's 3:00 A MAnd outside I hear the souls still screaming It's been so long you know since my head's been this clear Just like a ship lost in the night I just don't know which way I should steer But I'll keep chasing my dreams And only you can make them real I pour my heart out every night But do you know the way that I feel Sometimes this is work And don't you know sometimes this is play Sometimes you are listening to me And sometimes you don't hear a damn word that I say Sometimes there's a girl Sometimes I go home alone And I guess it's no wonder right now That I do very well on my own But I'll keep chasing my dreams And only you can make them real I pour my heart out every night But do you know the way that I feelI like to think about the time I met you Living with your people down in New Orleans Mad at your mama cause she'd never let you Ride in no nasty limousine Later on the levee with the moon up above I lost my heart and confessed my love Oh Lucy, God have mercy I've got to stop thinkin' 'bout that One summer night in a field of wheat God's sweet lanterns hanging in the sky Moving light on your tiny feet I knew I had to love you till the day I die They talk about Amazing Grace It meant something when I saw your face Oh Lucy, God have mercy I've got to stop thinkin' 'bout that I think of all the little things that I never told you I think I may get to hold you someday It's my brain just like a man possessed I can't do me no work, I can't get me no rest I can't understand it baby Don't like to think about the way it ended I hate remembering the things that I said I dream a dream of love so splendid I wake up hard in an empty bed I wonder who'll be loving you next Some fool will be writing bad checks Oh now Lucy, God have mercy I've got to stop thinkin' 'bout youWell I packed all of my things into this blanket To call this year to earn coyotes fill Kiss my wife and kids goodbye choke back the quiver in my breath And took my first steps into this corridor of death If I'm lucky I will make it to a drain With 500 of my brothers, I would share the strain Of standing in this boxcar praying for rain It's the only the way we will quench our thirst In these gardens of white crosses Growing in the California sand In these gardens of white crosses We are the children of poverty trying to a make a stand If we make it past the border, we will scatter Vanish just like smoke in autumn wind I will run until my color will not matter Hopin' I can find some work or possibly a friend There are others who have made it here They will show me how to find a job and a place to lay my head And I cannot be concerned with dreams of my children For there are 5 others in line for my bedSitting on the edge Looking for songs in a bottle Talking with the strangers Who don't know my pain Blurry eyed and burned out Chokin on more then I can swallow A crack in a little voice That calls out my name She said "Whatever happened to you It's been two years where have you been "And I guess all my fears were true The words are all gone The times been too long It's not too late to say"Sorry to a friend"What happened to my friend Staring in her face I see the past it still haunts me The road where we split up Is paved with the things I didn't say We had a wonderful times But terrible timing And just a leave her alone I'll just be in her way
