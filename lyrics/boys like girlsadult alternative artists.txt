I remember what you wore on the first day You came into my life and I thought"Hey, you know, this could be something"'Cause everything you do and words you say You know that it all takes my breath away And now I'm left with nothing So maybe it's true that I can't live without you And maybe two is better than one But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life And you've already got me coming undone And I'm thinking two is better than one I remember every look upon your face The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste You make it hard for breathing'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away I think of you and everything's okay I'm finally now believing Then maybe it's true that I can't live without you And maybe two is better than one But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life And you've already got me coming undone And I'm thinking two is better than oneToday is a winding road That's taking me to places that I didn't want to go Whoa Today in the blink of an eye I'm holding on to something and I do not know why I tried I tried to read between the lines, I tried to look in your eyes I want a simple explanation for what I'm feeling inside I gotta find a way out Maybe there's a way out Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer Do you know you're unlike any other You'll always be my thunder And I said, "Your eyes are the brightest of all the colors"I don't wanna ever love another You'll always be my thunder So bring on the rain And bring on the thunder Today is a winding road Tell me where to start and tell me something I don't know Whoa Today I'm on my own I can't move a muscle and I can't pick up the phone I don't know And now I'm itching for the tall grass and longing for the breeze I need to step outside just to see if I can breathe I gotta find a way out Maybe there's a way outPaper bags and plastic hearts All our belongings in shopping carts It's goodbye But we got one more night Let's get drunk and ride around And make peace with an empty town We can make it right Throw it away, forget yesterday We'll make the great escape And we won't hear a word they say They don't know us anyway Watch it burn Let it die'Cause we are finally free tonight Tonight will change our lives It's so good to be by your side, but we'll cry We won't give up the fight We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs And they'll think it's just 'cause we're young And we'll feel so aliveHey, hey, hey, hey Top down in the summer sun The day we met was like a hit-and-run And I still taste it on my tongue The sky was burning up like fireworks You made me want you oh so bad, it hurt But girl, in case you haven't heard I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hungover Love you forever, forever is over We used to kiss all night, now it's just a bar fight So don't call me cryin', say hello to goodbye 'Cause just one sip  would make me sick I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hungover Love you forever, but now it's over Hey, hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey, hey Hot sweat and blurry eyes We're spinnin' 'round a roller coaster ride The world stuck in black and white You drove me crazy every time we touched Now I'm so broken that I can't get up Oh girl, you make me such a lushIt's too late baby, there's no turning around I got my hands in my pocket and my head in a cloud This is how I do, when I think about you I never thought that you could break me apart I keep a sinister smile and a hole in my heart You want to get inside, then you can get in line But not this time'Cause you caught me off guard Now I'm running and screaming I feel like a hero and you are my heroine I won't try to philosophize I'll just take a deep breath then I'll look in your eyes This is how I feel, and it's so surreal I got a closet filled up to the brim With the ghosts of my past and their skeletons And I don't know why You'd even try But I won't lie You caught me off guard Now I'm running and screaming I feel like a hero and you are my heroine Do you know that your love is the sweetest sin Mmm, yeah Four letter word But I don't have the guts to say it Smile 'til it hurts Let's not make it complicated We've got a story But I'm about to change the ending You're perfect for me And more than just a friend So we can just stop pretending now I gotta let you know somehow I'll be your shelter I'll be your storm I'll make you shiver I'll keep you warm Whatever weather Baby, I'm yours Be your forever, be your fling Baby, I will be your everything Baby I Baby, I will Baby, I will be your everythingPaper bags and plastic hearts All our

you know the places I wanna go'Cause oh oh oh I've got a sickness, you've got the cure You've got the spark I've been lookin' for And I've got a plan, we walk out the door You know you wanna Just let go It's time to roll down the windows Sing it, oh oh We got all we need, so here we go Turn it up It's five minutes to midnight You're coming home with me tonight I can't get enough, shakin' me up, turn it up Alright, at five minutes to midnight We'll see our name in city lights We'll make the clock stop, make your heart drop and come alive We could Pack up and leave all our things behind No fact or fiction or storyline'Cause I need you more than just for tonight You're oh oh Like air, I can't stop my breathing in I'm weak and you were my medicine I won't stop till I am under your skinI got your runaway smile in my piggybank, baby Gonna cash it right in for a new Mercedes You were worth the hundred thousand miles But you couldn't stay awhile I got your little brown shirt in my bottom drawe,  baby And your little white socks in the top drawer You were always leaving your shit around And gone without a sound Yeah, I'm the first to fall and the last to know Where'd you go Now I'm heels over head I'm hangin' upside down Thinking how you left me for dead California bound I got a first class ticket to a night all alone And a front row seat up right by the phone'Cause you're always on my mind And I'm running out of time I've got your hair on my pillow and your smell in my sheets And it makes me think about you with the sand in your feet Is it all you thought it'd be You mean everything to meIt's over Look out below And I'm wasted, I still taste it Yeah, it's so hard to let go So breathe in now And breathe it out The forecast, a car crash It's looking like another...Breakdown, rebound This could be my last goodbye You cross your heart, I hope to die And I can't deny your eyes You know I tried to read between the lines I saw a warning sign And then you threw me up against the wall Who said that it's better to have loved and lost I wish that I had never loved at all No rewinds No second times And I won't break, I won't waste, everything you left behind So don't follow Just let it go The weather's, been better Don't let it be another..
