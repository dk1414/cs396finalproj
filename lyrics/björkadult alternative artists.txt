carved A secret code carved He offers a handshake Crooked five fingers They form a pattern Yet to be matched On the surface simplicity But the darkest pit in me And it's pagan poetry Pagan poetry Morse coding signals They pulsate They wake me up from my hibernatingI'm a fountain of blood In the shape of a girl You're the bird on the brim Hypnotised by the whirl Drink me, make me feel real Wet your beak in the stream Game we're playing is life Love's a two-way dream Leave me now, return tonight Tide will show you the way If you forget my name You will go astray Like a killer whale Trapped in a bay I'm a path of cinders Burning under your feet You're the one who walks me I'm your one-way street I'm a whisper in the water Secret for you to hear You're the one who grows distant When I beckon you nearWe live on a mountain right at the top There's a beautiful view from the top of the mountain Every morning I walk towards the edge And throw little things off Like car parts, bottles, and cutlery Or whatever I find lying around It's become a habit A way to start the day I go through all this before you wake up So I can feel happier to be safe up here with you I go through all this before you wake up So I can feel happier to be safe up here with you It's early morning, no one is awake I'm back at my cliff, still throwing things off I listen to the sounds they make on their way down I follow with my eyes till they crash I imagine what my body would sound like Slamming against those rocksAll these accidents that happen Follow the dot Coincidence makes sense Only with you, ooh You don't have to speak I feel Emotional landscapes They puzzle me The riddle gets solved And you push me up to This state of emergency How beautiful to be State of emergency Is where I want to be All that no one sees You see what's inside of me Every nerve that hurts You heal deep inside of me, ooh You don't have to speak I feelOur love was my womb But our bond has broken My shield is gone My protection is taken I am one wound My pulsating body Suffering being My heart is enormous lake Black with potion I am blind Drowning in this ocean My soul torn apart My spirit is broken Into the fabric of all He is woven You fear my limitless emotions I am bored of your apocalyptic obsessions Did I love you too much Devotion bent me broken So I rebelled Destroyed the iconA juxtapositioning fate Find our mutual coordinates Moments of clarity are so rare I better document this At last the view is fierce All that matters is Who is open chested And who has coagulated Who can share and Who has shut down the chances Show me emotional respect, oh respect, oh respect And I have emotional needs, oh needs, oh ooh I wish to synchronize our feelings, our feelings, oh ooh What is it that I have That makes me feel your pain Like milking a stone To get you to say itShhhh, shhhh It's oh, so quiet Shhhh, shhhh It's oh, so still Shhhh, shhhh You're all alone Shhhh, shhhh And so peaceful until You fall in love Zing, boom The sky up above Zing, boom Is caving in Wow, bam You've never been so nuts about a guy You wanna laugh, you wanna cry You cross your heart and hope to die Till it's over, and then Shhhh, shhhh It's nice and quiet Shhhh, shhhh But soon again Shhhh, shhhh Starts another big riotMaybe he will come out of this Maybe he won't Somehow I'm not too bothered either way Maybe he will come out of this loving me Maybe he will come out of this I smell declarations of solitude Maybe he will come out of this Vietnam vet comes after the war Lands in my house This wild lion doesn't fit in this chair Maybe he will come out of this loving me Maybe he won't I'm not taming no animal Maybe he will come out of this Once it was simple One feeling at a time It reached its peak then transformed These abstract complex feelings I just don't know how to handle them Should I throw oil on one of these moods But which one The joy peak Humor peak Frustration peak Anything peak For clarityStand up You've got to manage I won't sympathize Anymore And if you complain once more You'll meet an army of me And if you complain once more You'll meet an army of me You're alright There's nothing wrong Self-sufficience, please!And get to work And if you complain once more You'll meet an army of me And if you complain once more You'll meet an army of me, army of me You're on your own now We won't save you Your rescue squad Is too exhausted
