1, 2, 3, 4!Everything he does, better than anything ordinary Everything he wants he gets, cause everything he does is kinda necessary Though I believe in love, tell me, can anything last forever If life can live up to love, then hand on my heart, I'm never saying never Cause You're gonna make me, make me love you Nothing at all, nothing that I do The promise I made, the promise I made Is starting to fade, starting to fade babe You're gonna make me, make me love you Nothing at all that I cannot do The promise I made, the promise I made Is starting to fade, starting to fade Maybe next time I'll take a ride on by When I feel you near Cause I can't play this like I'm meant to now My Aladdin's lamp is down and I got a little fear Ooh baby, right here]Ladies, you're damn right You can't read a man's mind We're living in two tribes And heading for war Well, nobody's perfect We all gotta work it But fellas, we're worth it So, don't break the law Your call's late, big mistake You gotta hang about the limo for as long as I take Next time, read my mind and I'll be good to you We're gift wrapped kitty cats We're only turning into tigers when we gotta fight back Let's go Eskimo, out into the blue Come take my hand, understand that you can You're my man and I need you tonight Come make my dreams, honey, hard as it seems Loving me is as easy as pie-ie-ie I'm just a love machine, feeding my fantasy Give me a kiss or three and I'm fine I need a squeeze a day, 'stead of this negligee What will the neighbours say, this time Disco dancin' with the lights down low Beats are pumpin' on my stereo Neighbour's bangin' on the bathroom wall You're sayin', "Crank the bass, I gotta get some more"Water's runnin' in the wrong direction Got a feelin' it's a mixed up sign I can see it in my own reflection Something funny's goin' on inside my mind Don't know what is pushin' me higher It's the static from the floor below And then it drops and catches like a fire It's a sound I, it's a sound I know It's the sound of the underground The beat of the drum goes 'round and 'round Into to the overflow Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio Out to the electric night Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights The beat goes around and 'round It's the sound of the under, sound of the undergroundWhy don't you fool me, feed me, say you need me Without wicked games C'mon and hold me, hug me, say you love me And not my dirty brain Why don't you fool me, feed me, say you need me Without wicked games C'mon and hold me, hug me, say you love me And not my dirty brain I got one Alabama return That'll take me far away from you Cos when you take me in your arms I turn to slave, I can't be saved So I got my cappuccino to go And I'm heading for the hills again Cos if we party any more we'll start a fire Of pure desire]Closer Your mind's flying blind With your head and your face getting red And your heart beats closer You fall on your knees And the geek at your feet says you're neat And the beat gets closer You die for the thrill At the kill and your heart's had its fill But he still creeps closer You want it to freeze But you're weak, in too deep and the beat And the beat gets closerStatic tone on the phone, are we breaking again Must be something better, babe All the names that you called out in bed seem to fade To sometime never, but I won't cry for all the hunger in my heart, no I won't cry because I've made it through this far Just 'cause you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me, ooh It really doesn't faze me how you spend your time, ooh Just 'cause you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me, ooh It really doesn't faze me how you spend your time, ooh Out of the fire that burns inside me A phoenix is rising If you don't feel that you can love me I won't shoot you down And I won't cry for all the hunger in my heart, no No, I won't cry because I've stumbled through this farI wait underneath the covers All night beside you And who could ever question any crying I do My heavy heart is beating out a rhythm All night inside me And I fall a little harder every time that I do Watch me living it up, you totally Got me stuck in a rut, you're made for me How am I gonna step up and say to you I get the feeling boy, I want you, want you Conversation is tough because you're totally Walking around all the stuff you
