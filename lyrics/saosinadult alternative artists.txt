Taking on seven years The holy ghost had left alone Test my arms, kick like crazy I've been trying way too long Only push the way off to fight you Now I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm not sure Getting off my chest The story ends I will find a way without Tell him his eyes see too clear I will find a way without you Tell him his eyes see too clear That mistake was gold I know that without you Is something that I could never do That was why, staple the eyes and Seven dates for me to sell machines And tear on Seven years, you assured me That I'd be fine if I complied Only push the way off to fight you Only push the way off to fight you Now I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm not sure Getting off my chest The story endsWho holds the silver string Lost me to staggered motion When you run away Whoever changes shape Slowing oscillation I see you there Alternate the day Scream the last charade and let it be The fragment that anchors it all Separate the wave Drown inside the shade and let it go The vision that anchors it all And I'm forgetting everything you said For you to bounce right back Pick up right where you left off When you run away Whoever choose my place Showing obsoletion I see you thereIt's just like him To wander off in the evergreen park Slowly searching For any sign of the ones he used to love He says he's got nothing left to live for And this time I think you'll know You're not alone There is more to this, I know You can make it out You will live to tell She's just like him Spoiled rotten, confused by the lies She's been fed And she's searching for no one Her eyes turn to green and she seems to be happy That she is here And this time I think you'll know You're not alone There is more to this, I know You can make it out You will live to tellOh, start saving green and before breathing I have your voice on tape in a southern accent screaming at me I was only one and we weren't prepared for one before dreaming I have your voice on tape in a southern accent screaming at me Now things look lovely to you Holding back, now and forever Sweetheart, things look lovely Longing for midnight and I deny You were walking so peculiar like You had something to hide You were walking so peculiar like You had something to hide, love Sweet penance for a sound It might explode in our hands I'm bordered in a brown pigmentation of Where the only bonds cut short, turned in, then stopped I've been watching Rose give in and I missed out on savoring it so I've been watching Rose give in to it Severing the ties between mother and son I've been watching Rose give in to it Severing the ties between mother and sonI hear a signal of perjury The odds are burning above Begin, we've already been that far but it's not coming back I trust the gates of the lion's den I can say open up to us Descend on us, we find a pathway to let it go Our patience won't be alone Our actions won't be undone The answer will be unknown, be unknown The beggar gives up eternity Shining light through honour Begin, we've already been that far but it's not coming back Descend on us, we find a pathway to let it go Our patience won't be alone Our actions won't be undone The answer will be unknown, be unknown Our patience won't be alone Our actions won't be undone The answer will be unknown, be unknownOn my face I scratched out something like a silhouette Around the golden ten like lambs On my face I've hidden away any embarrassment Away from my acquaintances I'm not sold on anything but half a dream I'm not sensing a thing I stare at a blank notebook page And it's my life and there is Nothing I can think to write I fear the thought of not sensing a thing I hope you don't see a thing Smile through everyone you ever meet So what  You gave him the time of day Twist back and end this suffering Au naturel, I honestly give up and de-robe I stare at a blank notebook page And it's my life and there is Nothing I can think to write I fear the thought of not sensing a thingI've already been there A broken lock Inside a rotting idea of a heart You'll never find it You took my name On top a desolate mountain of hope I saw it frame by frame We'll take it all apart Until there's nothing left to prove Perfect the weakest thread until the bitter end!You'll never see me there within my eyes Before you know it will be gone I've never heard of A patient prayer Within a chorus of unending step I've already been there It feels the same Inside a rotting idea of a heart If you write it down It feels the sameTaking back, overdone Free and safely Souvenirs, out of style Right in front and right on Do it so, I'll be mad, you'll be gone And I'm sad that you'll be gold upon Gold in my veins Tango with daddy and separate only Smile my only rights of passage Only you, mark my words Upon the stage you strike off To get engaged in California And I'm sad that you'll be gold upon Gold in my veins Tango with daddy and separate only Smile my only rights of passage Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose I want to know Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose Don't say that I'm the one you want to lose Don't say that I'm the one you want to loseI miss the part when we were moving forward now But maybe someday, I'll be something more than love Just know I'll never tell And when you're on your way down And you're waiting for your body's re-entry again We speak in different voices When fighting with the ones we've loved We speak in different voices Why can't we say what we're thinking of I'm missing parts, now that you've told me everything And I was blessed and I've forgotten how to love You said you'd never tell And when you're on your way down And you're waiting for your body's re-entry again We speak in different voices When fighting with the ones we've loved We speak in different voices Why can't we say what we're thinking ofBetray The Avalon is always beside me And I'm following it home Where is my home Orion glows And his eyes open up I once believed that I would set you in line If only I had the strength you'd be completely accepting something else If you keep asking me I'll melt away in the summer air It won't hurt half as much and I'll beg for you to stop it now If you keep asking me I'll melt away in the summer air It won't hurt half as much and I'll beg for you just tell me something The fluid through the alpha waves and power cables everywhere Exercising self-control The child calls And she lies open I would believe if only I'd been thinking at all If only I had the strength you'd be completely accepting something else If you keep asking me I'll melt away in the summer air It won't hurt half as much and I'll beg for you to stop it now If you keep asking me I'll melt away in the summer air It won't hurt half as much and I'll beg for you just tell me something
