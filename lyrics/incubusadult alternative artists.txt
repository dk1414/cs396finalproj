Sometimes I feel the fear of uncertainty, stinging clear And I, I can't help but ask myself, how much I let the fear take the wheel and steer It's driven me before, and it seems to have a vague Haunting mass appeal But lately I'm beginning to find that I Should be the one behind the wheel Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there With open arms and open eyes, yeah Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there I’ll be there, yeah, ohh So if I decide to waiver my chance to be one of the hive Will I choose water over wine, and hold my own and drive Ohh-oh-ohh It's driven me before, and it seems to be the way That everyone else gets around But lately I'm beginning to find that when I Drive myself my light is foundPardon me while I burst Pardon me while I burst A decade ago, I never thought I would be At twenty-three on the verge of spontaneous combustion, woe-is-me But I guess that it comes with the territory An ominous landscape of never-ending calamity I need you to hear, I need you to see That I have had all that I can take and exploding seems like a definite possibility To me So pardon me while I burst into flames I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame Pardon me, pardon me..  I'll never be the same Not two days ago, I was having a look In a book and I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knees I said, "I can relate," because lately I've been Thinking of combustication as a welcomed vacation from The burdens of the planet earth Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3 DBut thinking so much differentlyWe all have a weakness But some of ours are easy to identify Look me in the eye And ask for forgiveness We'll make a pact to never speak that word again Yes, you are my friend We all have something that digs at us At least we dig each other So when weakness turns my ego up I know you'll count on the me from yesterday If I turn into another Dig me up from under what is covering The better part of me Sing this song Remind me that we'll always have each other When everything else is gone, oh oh We all have a sickness That cleverly attaches and multiplies No matter how we tryI dig my toes into the sand The ocean looks like a thousand diamonds strewn across a blue blanket I lean against the wind, pretend that I am weightless And in this moment I am happy, happy I wish you were here I wish you were here I wish you were here I wish you were here I lay my head onto the sand The sky resembles a backlit canopy with holes punched in it I'm counting U FOs, I signal them with my lighter And in this moment I am happy, happy I wish you were here I wish you were here I wish you were here Wish you were here Oh yeah, woah-oh The world's a roller coaster and I am not strapped in Maybe I should hold with care, but my hands are busy in the air sayingMeet me in outer space We could spend the night, watch the earth come up I've grown tired of that place, won't you come with me We could start again How do you do it Make me feel like I do How do you do it It's better than I ever knew, huh Meet me in outer space I will hold you close if you're afraid of heights I need you to see this place, it might be the only way That I can show you how it feels to be inside of you How do you do it Make me feel like I do How do you do it It's better than I ever knew, uh How do you do it Make me feel like I doTonight we drink to youth And holding fast to truth Don't wanna lose what I had as a boy My heart still has a beat But love is now a feat As common as a cold day in L ASometimes when I'm alone, I wonder Is there a spell that I am under Keeping me from seeing the real thing Love hurts But sometimes it’s a good hurt And it feels like I'm alive Love sings When it transcends the bad things Have a heart and try me'Cause without love, I won't survive I'm fettered and abused Stand naked and accused Should I surface this one-man submarine I only want the truth So tonight, we drink to youth I'll never lose what I had as a boyI hear you on the radio You permeate my screen, it's unkind But if I met you in a scissor fight I'd cut off both your wings on principle, alone Principle, alone Hey, megalomaniac You're no Jesus, yeah, you're no fucking Elvis Wash your hands clean of yourself, baby And step down, step down Step down If I were your appendages I'd hold open your eyes so you would see That all of us are heaven sent And there was never meant to be only one To be only one Hey, megalomaniac You're no Jesus, yeah, you're no fucking Elvis Wash your hands clean of yourself, baby And step down, step down Step down Step down Step down Oh, step down, oohA cloud hangs over this city by the sea I watch the ships pass and wonder if she might be Out there and sober as well from loneliness Please do persist, girl it's time we met and made a mess I picture your face at the back of my eyes A fire in the attic, proof of the prize Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly A cloud hangs over and mutes my happiness A thousand ships couldn't sail me back from distress Wish you were here I'm a wounded satellite I need you now, put me back together, make me right I picture your face at the back of my eyes A fire in the attic, proof of the prize Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly I'm calling your name up into the air Not one of the others could ever compare!Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly!Wait, there is a light There is a fire Illuminated attic Fate, or something better I could care less Just stay with me a while Wait, there is a light There is a fire De-fragmenting the attic Fate, or something better I could care less Just stay with me a while, ohBetter than watching Geller bending silver spoons Better than witnessing newborn nebulas in bloom She who sees from up high smiles and surely sings Perspective pries your once weighty eyes and it gives you wings I haven't felt the way I feel today In so long it's hard for me to specify I'm beginning to notice How much this feels like a waking limb Pins and needles, nice to know you Goodbye, nice to know you Goodbye, nice to know you Goodbye, nice to know you Goodbye, nice to know you, to know you Deeper than the deepest Cousteau would ever go And higher than the heights of what we often think we know Blessed she who clearly sees the wood for the trees To obtain a bird's eye is to turn a blizzard to a breeze I haven't felt the way I feel today In so long it's hard for me to specify I'm beginning to notice How much this feels like a waking limb Pins and needles, nice to know youTo see you when I wake up Is a gift I didn't think could be real To know that you feel the same as I do Is a three-fold utopian dream You do something to me that I can't explain So would I be out of line if I said I miss you I see your picture, I smell your skin on The empty pillow next to mine You have only been gone ten days But already I'm wasting away I know I'll see you again, whether far or soon But I need you to know that I care and I miss you
