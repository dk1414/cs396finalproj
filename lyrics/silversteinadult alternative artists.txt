The drugs begin to peak A smile of joy arrives in me But sedation changes to panic and nausea And breath starts to shorten and heartbeats pound softer You won't try to save me You just want to hurt me, and leave me desperate You taught my heart a sense I never knew I had I can forget the times that I was Lost and depressed from the awful truth, how do you do it You're my heroine You won't leave me alone Chisel my heart out of stone, I give in every time You taught my heart a sense I never knew I had I can forget the times that I was Lost and depressed from the awful truth, how do you do it You're my heroineThere is a place where the sidewalk ends And before the street begins,And there the grass grows soft and white,And there the sun burns crimson bright,And there the moon-bird rests from his flight To cool in the peppermint wind.Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black And the dark street winds and bends,Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,And watch where the chalk-white arrows go To the place where the sidewalk ends.Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,For the children, they mark, and the children, they know The place where the sidewalk ends When I'm lying in your bed Play the motions through my head You know that I'm thinking, I'm thinking And I have reasons to believe that I'm not the only one you spend this time with But I’ll stay You say you're weak You won't let me down You won't let me down You lie through your teeth You smile in your sleep You smile in your sleep When we met You said we were the same You know that we're different, we're different And all the times you promised me that Everything would work out in the end You were gravely mistaken You say you're weak You won't let me down You won't let me down You lie through your teeth You smile in your sleep You smile in your sleepYeah I lef' home when the kid was three and it sure felt good to be fancy free Tho I knew it wasn't quite the fatherly thing to do But that kid kept screamin' and throwin' up and pissin' in his pants til I had enough So just for revenge I went and named him Sue Yeah it was Gatlinburg in mid July I was gettin' drunk but gettin' by Gettin' old and goin' from bad to worse When thru the door with an awful scream comes the ugliest queen I've ever seen He says my name is Sue how do you do then he hits me with his purse Now this ain't the way he tells the tale but he scratched my face with his fingernails And then he bit my thumb and kicked me with his high-heeled shoe So I hit him in the nose and he started to cry and he threw some perfume in my eye And it sure ain't easy fightin' with a boy named Sue So I hit him in the head with a caned-back chair And he screamed hey dad you mussed my hair And he hit me in the navel and knocked out a piece of my lint He was spittin' blood I was spittin' teeth And we crashed through the wall and out into the street A kickin and gougin' in the mud and the blood and the creme de menthBlame it on the weather, but I'm a mess And this February darkness has me hating everyone And I know I need your comfort But this drama makes me sick And the longer I lay here I know it's harder to get up without you Lose another day here Lose another year here, I'm with you Finally, something out there that's making sense And it's just another trend carefully hidden in your dress And this cycle's neverending and this fashion's overdone And the further that I run away, the further I'll come back to shelter Lose another day here Lose another year here, I'm with you You are the fire on my apartment floor Sixteen stories, I'd rather burn than fall It isn't fate that took us all by storm It's just the turn of a card Lose another day here Lose another year here, I'm with you You are the fire on my apartment floor Sixteen stories, I'd rather burn than fall It isn't fate that took us all by storm It's just the turn of a cardI'll sing you a poem of a silly young king Who played with the world at the end of a string,But he only loved one single thing—And that was just a peanut-butter sandwich.His scepter and his royal gowns,His regal throne and golden crowns Were brown and sticky from the mounds And drippings from each peanut-butter sandwich.His subjects all were silly fools For he had passed a royal rule That all that they could learn in school Was how to make a peanut-butter sandwich.He would not eat his sovereign steak,He scorned his soup and kingly cake,And told his courtly cook to bake An extra-sticky peanut-butter sandwich.And then one day he took a bit And started chewing with delight,But found his mouth was stuck quite tight From that last bite of peanut-butter sandwich.His brother pulled, his sister pried,The wizard pushed, his mother cried,"My boy's committed suicide From eating his last peanut-butter sandwich!"She had blue skin,And so did he.He kept it hid And so did she.They searched for blue Their whole life through,Then passed right by-And never knew She's cutting out the bruises Forgetting her excuses For being here again With a suitcase packed and waiting by the door In her head Convinced herself she hasn't lost enough to quit But tonight she lays here thinking"What if I just left In the middle of the night Back to California And never looked back "She'll fantasize about it Every single day But she can't find it In her heart to run away And no one's listening With Northern Massachusetts On his knees to stay He's begging"Please, oh, baby, please, I can explain It won't happen again"The first time we met Your face became etched In my mind You were the sun I was the one Who worshipped you My hands were your guns Your eyes were my muse And I knew you could never love me I had so much sorrow inside You could never reach But can I still keep A place in your heart You broke my heart You promised me the moon and stars I fell for your dreams I fell for your lies There was no other way You know I tried And I knew you could never love me I had so much sorrow inside You could never reach But can I still keep A place in your heart Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too Went for a ride in a flying shoe."Hooray!""What fun!""It's time we flew!"Said Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too.Ickle was captain, and Pickle was crew And Tickle served coffee and mulligan stew As higher And higher And higher they flew,Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too.Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too,Over the sun and beyond the blue."Hold on!""Stay in!""I hope we do!"Cried Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too.Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle too Never returned to the world they knew,And nobody Knows what's Happened to Dear Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too
