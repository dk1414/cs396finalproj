Mirror mirror on the wall Tell me mirror, what is wrong Can it be my De La Clothes Or is it just my De La Soul What I do ain't make-believe People say I sit and try But when it comes to being De La It's just me myself and I It's just me myself and I It's just me myself and I It's just me myself and I Now you tease my Plug One style And my Plug One spectacles You say Plug One and Two are hippies No we're not, that's pure plug bull Always pushing that we formed an image There's no need to lie When it comes to being Plug One It's just me myself and I Vibe, vibrations Stakes is high You know them stakes is high When we talkin' 'bout the vibe, vibrations Stakes is high You know them stakes is high We be talkin' 'bout vibe, vibrations Stakes is high You know them stakes is high The instamatic focal point bringin' damage to your borough Be some brothers from the East with them beats that be thorough Got the solar gravitation, so I'm bound to pull it I gets down like brothers are found duckin' from bullets Gun control means usin' both hands in my land Where it's all about the cautious livin' Migratin' to a higher form of consequence Compliments of strugglin' that shouldn't be notable Man, every word I say should be a Hip-Hop Quotable I'm sick of bitches shakin' asses I'm sick of talkin' 'bout blunts, sick of Versace glasses Sick of slang, sick of half-ass awards shows Sick of name-brand clothes Sick of R&B bitches over bullshit tracks Cocaine and crack, which brings sickness to blacks Sick of swoll'-head rappers with they sickenin' raps Clappers of gats, makin' the whole sick world collapse The facts are gettin' sicker, even sicker, perhaps I Stickabush to make a bundle to escape this synapseThree, that's the magic number Yes, it is, it's the magic number Somewhere in this hip-hop soul community Was born three: Mase, Dove and me And that's the magic number Difficult preachin' is Posdnuos' pleasure Pleasure in preachin' starts in the heart Something that stimulates the music in a measure Measure in the music, breaks in three parts Casually see but don't do like the soul'Cause seein' and doin' are actions for monkeys Doin' hip-hop hustle, no rock and roll Unless your name's Brewster, 'cause Brewster's a punk Parents let go, 'cause there's magic in the air Criticizing rap shows you're out of order Stop, look and listen to the phrase Fred Astaires And don't get offended while Mase do-si-do's your daughter A tri-camera rolls since our music's now set Fly rhymes are stored on a Da.I.S.Y production It stands for "Da Inner Sound, Y'all" and y'all can bet That the action's not a trick, but sure 'nough a functionUp in them 5-star tellies saying two mic rhymes Be them average M C's of the times Unlike them, we craft gems So systematically inclined to pen lines Without saying the producer's name all over the track Yeah I said it  What you need to do is get back To reading credits, we them medics Alphabetically stuck on that A grade shit Now quit now before we pour That sure shot pure rock cocaine flow From the top of the key for 3 -- Villain!Been on in the game as long as he can wheelie a Schwinn Turn the corner spinning, bust that ass and get up Dust off the mask, whoever laugh give him a head up He got jumped, it pumped his adrenaline He said it made him tougher than a bump of raw medicine To write all night long, the hourglass is still slow Flow from Hellborn to free power like L IL Co And still owe bills, pay dues forever Slay youths when it comes to who's more cleverer Use to wore a leather goose V with a fur collar And charged a fee for loose leaf words per dollar Ya heard  Holler - broad or dude, we need food Eat your teams for sure, the streets sure seem rude For fam like the Partridges, pardon him for the mix-up Battle for your Atari cartridges or put your kicks up It's a stick upGreetings girl and welcome to my world of phrase I'm right up to bat It's a D.A.I.S.Y  Age and you're about to walk top-stage So wipe your Lottos on the mat Hip-hop love this is and don't mind when I quiz your Involvements before the sun But clear your court 'cause this is a one-man sport And who's better for this than Plug One  Now don't worry about me squashin' other deals'Cause they've already been squooshed Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue Right behind the bush You'll stay with me, I know this But not because of all my Earthly treasures Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos But because I know I'll love you better May I cut this dance to introduce myself as The chosen one to speak Let me lay my hand across yours And aim a kiss upon your cheek The name's Plug Two And from the soul I bring you The Daisy of your choice May it be filled with the pleasure principle In circumference to my voice About those other Jennys I reckoned with Lost them all like a homework excuse This time the Magic Number is two'Cause it takes two, not three, to seduce My destiny of love is brought to an apex Sex is a mere molecule In this world of love that I have for you It's true Yes, this is Miss Renee King I'm in Philadelphia I want you to give me a call on
