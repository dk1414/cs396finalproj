with you With you Another girl, another planet Another girl, another planetYou left that morning You gave me no warning You were my best friend Oh, I can't live without you There was something about you I want you back again Baby, sometimes I think of you Out there in the night All the comforts of home have been denied People find it hard to understand I never cried before One thing's for certain There's nothing around that Could make me cry no more Baby, sometimes I think of you Out there in the night All the comforts of home have been denied Compared to all of them You stand out You gave me pure unspoiled love They're all reaching and grabbing But all you did was give me Love and love and love and loveI always flirt with death I look ill but I don't care about it I can face your threats
