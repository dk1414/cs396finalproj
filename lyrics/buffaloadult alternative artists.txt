There's something happening here But what it is ain't exactly clear There's a man with a gun over there A-telling me I got to beware I think it's time we stop Children, what's that sound Everybody look what's going down There's battle lines being drawn And nobody's right if everybody's wrong Young people speaking their minds Are gettin' so much resistance from behind It's time we stop Hey, what's that sound Everybody look what's going down What a field day for the heat A thousand people in the street Singing songs and a-carryin' signs Mostly say, "Hooray for our side" There's a black bird perched outside my window I hear him calling I hear him sing He burns me with his eyes of gold to embers He sees all my sins He reads my soul One day that bird, he spoke to me Like Martin Luther Like Pericles Come join the murder Come fly with black We'll give you freedom From the human trap Come join the murder Soar on my wings You'll touch the hand of God And He'll make you king And He'll make you kingThere's something happening here But what it is ain't exactly clear There's a man with a gun over there A-telling me I got to beware I think it's time we stop Children, what's that sound
