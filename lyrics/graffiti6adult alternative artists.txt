Stare into the sun, stare into the sun I'm gonna stare into the sun, stare into the sun, sun, sun, sun There ain't a cloud in the sky or nothing I see the birds they fly on something This is the summer, it's the summer for the colour, baby The sun is shining down for lovers But not for me, it shines for others You gave me love babe, gave me love babe, now it's over I'm feeling blue 'cause love is gone Guess I lose but life goes on Got a few tears to dry Before these blue shade days are gone And I can stare into the sun I'm gonna swim in the seas of green, I tell you I'm gonna run like I'm 17, forever I see a rainbow, purple and gold, but it's covered Oh yeah, 'cause there's a cloud she follows me 'round wherever Her last words keep raining down, no shelter You took your love babe, took your love babe Now the colours all meld togetherRemember me, remember me when you are down Float me on air, and lift me up from off the ground Oh baby, I feel lazy so lie here in my arms tonight Would you deny a poor man's cry, a poor man's cry Just when I'm finding it hard to breathe You lift the weight inside of me Oh baby I see the light that's burning bright, and we're the stars Oh Annie, you save me from the world Oh Annie, you save me from the world My head's alive, my head's alive, can't get no peace You're my escape from this heartache, I need relief Oh baby, this world's crazy, so lie here in my arms tonight You can't deny a poor man's cry, a poor man's cry Just when I'm finding it hard to breathe You lift the weight inside of me Oh baby I see the light that's burning bright, and we're the stars Oh Annie, you save me from the world Oh Annie, you save me from the world I say, stars, please shine for me tonight Stars, please shine for me tonight You lift the weight now baby, from insideWith a rose in her hand And the candle on her chair She put her hand on my hand And with teary eyes she said Precious time we had together With a stone in my heart I stood up and love was gone Makes me stronger Makes me wiser, oh Lord Makes me stronger Makes me wiser, oh Lord Meet me at the gates, my love Down by the lock tonight In a sequined dress she said Everything will be alright Precious time we had together With a stone in my heart I stood up and love was gone Makes me stronger Makes me wiser, oh Lord Makes me stronger Makes me wiser, oh Lord Makes me stronger Makes me
