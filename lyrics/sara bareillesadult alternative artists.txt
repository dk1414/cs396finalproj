Something always brings me back to you It never takes too long No matter what I say or do I'll still feel you here 'til the moment I'm gone You hold me without touch You keep me without chains I never wanted anything so much Than to drown in your love and not feel your rain Set me free, leave me be I don't wanna fall another moment into your gravity Here I am, and I stand So tall, just the way I'm supposed to be But you're on to me and all over me Oh, you loved me 'cause I'm fragile When I thought that I was strong But you touch me for a little while And all my fragile strength is gone Set me free, leave me be I don't wanna fall another moment into your gravity Here I am, and I stand So tall, just the way I'm supposed to be But you're on to me and all over meIt's not simple to say Most days I don't recognize me That these shoes and this apron That place and its patrons Have taken more than I gave them It's not easy to know I'm not anything like I used to be Although it's true I was never attention's sweet center I still remember that girl She's imperfect, but she tries She is good, but she lies She is hard on herself She is broken and won't ask for help She is messy, but she's kind She is lonely most of the time She is all of this mixed up And baked in a beautiful pie She is gone, but she used to be mine It's not what I asked for Sometimes life Just slips in through a backdoor And carves out a person Who makes you believe it's all true And now I've got you You're not what I asked for If I'm honest, I know I would give it all back for A chance to start over And rewrite an ending or two For the girl that I knew Who'll be reckless, just enough Who'll get hurt But who learns how to toughen up When she's bruised and gets used By a man who can't love And then she'll get stuck And be scared of the life that's inside her Growing stronger each day'Til it finally reminds her To fight just a little To bring back the fire in her eyes That's been gone, but used to be mine Used to be mine She is messy, but she's kind She is lonely most of the time She is all of this mixed up And baked in a beautiful pie She is gone, but she used to be mineHead underwater and they tell me To breathe easy for a while The breathing gets harder, even I know that Made room for me, it's too soon to see If I'm happy in your hands I'm unusually hard to hold on to Blank stares at blank pages No easy way to say this You mean well, but you make this hard on me I'm not gonna write you a love song'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this If you're on your way I'm not gonna write you to stay If all you have is leavin', I'ma need a better reason To write you a love song today Today, yeah I learned the hard way that they all say Things you wanna hear And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you And your twisted words, your help just hurts You are not what I thought you were Hello to high and dryYou can be amazing You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug You can be the outcast Or be the backlash of somebody’s lack of love Or you can start speaking up Nothing’s gonna hurt you the way that words do When they settle ‘neath your skin Kept on the inside and no sunlight Sometimes a shadow wins But I wonder what would happen if you Say what you wanna say And let the words fall out Honestly, I wanna see you be brave With what you want to say And let the words fall out Honestly, I wanna see you be brave I just wanna see you I just wanna see you I just wanna see you I wanna see you be brave I just wanna see you I just wanna see you I just wanna see you I wanna see you be braveLet the bough break, let it come down crashin'Let the sun fade out to a dark sky I can't say I'd even notice it was absent'Cause I could live by the light in your eyes I'll unfold before you Would have strung together The very first words of a lifelong love letter Tell the world that we finally got it all right I choose you I will become yours and you will become mine I choose you I choose you There was a time when I would have believed them If they told me you could not come true Just love's illusion But then you found me and everything changed And I believe in something again My whole heart Will be yours forever This is a beautiful start To a lifelong love letterI stick with real things Usually facts and figures When information's in its place I minimize the guessing game Guess what I don't like guessing games or when I feel things Before I know the feelings How am I supposed to operate if I'm just tossed around by fate Like on an unexpected date With a stranger who might talk too fast Or ask me questions about myself before I've decided that He can ask me questions about myself He might sit too close Or call the waiter by his first name Or eat Oreos But eat the cookie before the cream But what scares me the most...What scares me the most...Is what if when he sees me What if he doesn't like it What if he runs the other way and I can't hide from it What happens then if When he knows me He's only disappointed What if I give myself away to only get it given back I couldn't live with that So I'm just fine inside my shell-shaped mind This way I get the best view So when he sees me, I want him toLet it begin, let Adam in Step one, original sin Underneath the leaves, Adam found Eve Both of them found something sweet under the apple tree Then it was over, roads divide Step two, learning how to lie Let me ask a question to present day How the hell did Eve end up with all the damn blame All the damn blame To all the dirty looks, the kitty-cat calls To the ones who try and throw us up against the back walls Let me tell you something you'll understand:Only the little boys tell you they're a big man To all my sisters and all our friends We have to thank them, please Strength means blessed with an enemy All my, my, my, my armor comes from you You make me try, try, try, try harder Oh, that's all I ever do, ever do Oh, no no, my, my, my, my armor comes from you You make me stronger, stronger Now hand me my armorCome by the fire, lay down your head My love, I see you're growing tired So set the bad day by the bed And rest a while, your eyes can close You don’t have to do a thing but listen to me sing I know you miss the world, the one you knew The one where everything made sense Because you didn't know the truth, that's how it works’Til the bottom drops out and we learn We're all just hunters seeking solid ground Don't stop trying to find me here amidst the chaos Though I know it's blinding there's a way out Say out loud, we will not give up on love now No fear, don't you turn like Orpheus, just stay here Hold me in the dark and when the day appears We'll say we did not give up on love today I'll show you good, restore your faith I’ll try and somehow make a meaning of the poison in this place Convince you, love, don’t breathe it in You were written in the stars that we are swimming in And it has no name, no guarantee It's just the promise of a day I know that some may never see But that’s enough, if the bottom drops out I hope my love was someone else's solid groundBum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum Bum bum bum bum bum bum Bum bum bum bum bum bum This is my winter song to you The storm is coming soon It rolls in from the sea My voice: a beacon in the night My words will be your light To carry you to me Is love alive Is love alive Is love They say that things just cannot grow Beneath the winter snow Or so I have been told They say we're buried far Just like a distant star I simply cannot holdDoor clicks while his wheels start spinning on the pavement And I go fill the space up where he has been staying Won't lose much sleep, he never went that deep"Love you," oh, you sweet thing, no, I never said that Let me hold your ego while you get your bag packed Don't take this the wrong way But when the spade shows up, I call it by its first name We were, we were never gonna catch fire We'd've burned up in the flames Long before they ever rose up higher Someday, I, I won't have to feel the cold But I do now, so I'll know What it feels like when I feel fire, fire Mmm, fire Fire Talk, touch, kiss, then this one's just like all the others And I know all too well that I want deeper waters I held my breath to swim But shallow shores aren't safe enough to dive in
