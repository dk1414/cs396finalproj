this it My farewell delegation These few trees This station that is no station That is left, that is mine I could have saved you all You gave me so little time'Well the Angels who'd hung around And dreamed their dreams For eternity they'd schemed their schemes Awoke and said 'Dick, we understand you to the letter But you could have it like it was before, only better''Yes, I'd like that - I'd try again But will you make them bow and honor my name ''Oh yes, by comparison the last time will seem rather tame We'll set you up in the desert In a discotheque called Parody, that's French for paradise Like an immovable spot, rest now you've had a rough trot'The Last Dictator woke from where he'd been In a mood that was mean, he related the dream'I'm in a very bad mood; I had a very bad dream What

right and wrong Beyond good and evil Beyond right and wrong In the tiring rain You're my baby again Your dread black hair and your man dies As secret lies, are top stilts of lies I tripped her through the empty streets To hold you close beneath linen sheets Inside that vanity room I suffocate in pharaoh's tomb Just a beggar and a thief Holding on to the suspension of disbelief Just a beggar and a thief A siren and her song And beneath the tiring rain A breath linger by loss and by pain I get with you beneath the stellar sky I felt the tears behind your eyes Beyond good and evil Beyond right and wrong Beyond good and evil Beyond right and wrong In the tiring rain You're my baby againThe whole family took the car Bought machine guns in a red red bar Another one’s down Another one’s down Shoot him now Shoot him now There’ll be blue skies and sunshine And a white picket fence around my home Oh you’re so wrong You’re so wrong The war goes on and on and on and on and on You’re married to

Shark what have we done What have you done with the sun You put the sun before the darkness Is this the winter of the fall You put the summer before the darkness Is this the winter of our fall Oh Shark Who is this God Before whim every man is made to cower I feel ashamed And the simple things come harder now I doubt my legs My words My every move Oh Shark I called down into the sea But I have lost your soul And you would not answer me Oh Shark I prayed unto the sea To deliver you unto me But the waters lay still They would not part I lost hope I lost my heart My friend the Shark You put the sun before the darkness Is this the winter of the fall You put the summer before the darkness Is this the winter of our fall You put the summer before the darkness Is this the winter of our fall You put the summer before the darkness Is this the winter of our fallThat night he foretold his enemies' doom His words loomed large across the room They boomed His pupils were quiet and well groomed With swelling heart He began his favourite part When Eve, who since she wed Had gained a lot of weight From the apples on which she fed It was compensation she said For the marginal life that she'd
