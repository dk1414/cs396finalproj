was so bright The old neighborhood was so alive And every kid on the whole damn street Was gonna make it big and not be beat Now the neighborhood's cracked and torn The kids are grown up, but their lives are worn How can one little street swallow so many lives Chances thrown, nothing's free Longing for what used to be Still it's hard, hard to see Fragile lives, shattered dreams Jamie had a chance, well, she really did Instead, she dropped out and had a couple of kids Mark still lives at home 'cause he's got no job He just plays guitar, smokes a lot of pot And Jay committed suicide And
