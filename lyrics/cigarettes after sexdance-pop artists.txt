You leapt from crumbling bridges watching cityscapes turn to dust Filming helicopters crashing in the ocean from way above Got the music in you, baby, tell me why Got the music in you, baby, tell me why You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers wrapped in your arms You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos left in the dark Got the music in you, baby, tell me why Got the music in you, baby, tell me why You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye Your lips, my lips Apocalypse Your lips, my lips Apocalypse Go and sneak us through the rivers Flood is rising up on your knees Oh, please Come out and haunt me, I know you want me Come out and haunt meI remember when I first noticed that you liked me back We were sitting down in a restaurant, waiting for the check We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached But I could tell that something had changed, how you looked at me then Kristen, come right back I've been waiting for you To slip back in bed When you light the candle And on the Lower East Side, you're dancing with me now And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe Think I like you best when you're just with me and no one else Kristen, come right back I've been waiting for you To slip back in bed When you light the candle And I'm kissing you, lying in my room Holding you until you fall asleep And it's just as good as I knew it would be Stay with me, I don't want you to leaveI know that you say I get mean when I'm drinking, but Then again, sometimes I get really sweet so What does it mean if I tell you to go fuck yourself Or if I say that you're beautiful to me It's affection, always Ooh, you're gonna see it someday My attention for you Even if it's not what you need Sometimes we talk all night long, we don't shut up And when it's late, we'll say we're still wide awake so We love to talk about how you'll come up to visit me And we'll rent a car and we'll drive upstate It's affection, always Ooh, you're gonna see it someday My attention's on you Even if it's not what you need I think of you, I want you too I'd fall for you I think of you, I want you too I'd fall for you I think of you, I want you too I'd fall for you I think of you, I want you too I'd fall for youWhispered something in your ear It was a perverted thing to say But I said it anyway Made you smile and look away Nothing's gonna hurt you baby As long as you're with me you'll be just fine Nothing's gonna hurt you baby Nothing's gonna take you from my side When we dance in my living room To that silly 90's R&B When we have a drink or three Always ends in a hazy shower scene Nothing's gonna hurt you baby As long as you're with me you'll be just fine Nothing's gonna hurt you baby Nothing's gonna take you from my side When we laugh into the microphone and sing With our sunglasses on to our favorite songs When we're laughing in the microphone and singing With our sunglasses on to our favorite songsWatching the video that you sent me The one where you're showering with wet hair dripping You know that I'm obsessed with your body But it's the way you smile that does it for me It's so sweet, knowing that you love me Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair It's so sweet Watching the video where you're lying In your red lingerie ten times nightly You know I think your skin's the perfect color But it's always your eyes that pull me under It's so sweet, knowing that you love me Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair It's so sweet And I will gladly break it, I will gladly break my heart for you And I will gladly break it, I will gladly break my heart for you And I will gladly break it, I will gladly break my heart for you And I will gladly break it, I will gladly break my heart for youSunsets We wander through a foreign town Strangely, there's nobody else around So you open your dress and show me your tits On the swing set at the old playground And when you go away, I still see you With sunlight on your face in my rear-view Sunsets I wanna hear your voice A love that nobody could destroy Took photographs like Brautigan's book covers That we both adored And when you go away, I still see you With sunlight on your face in my rear view This always happens to me this way Recurring visions of such sweet days And when you go away, I still see you With sunlight on your face in my rear view When you go away, I still see you With sunlight on your face in my rear viewI wanna line my walls with photographs you sent Of you lying in your swimsuit on the bed Can't live without your love inside me now I'll find a way to slip into your skin, somehow I wanna fuck your love slow Catch my heart, go swim Feel your lips crush Hold you here, my loveliest friend I love to watch you when you're trying on your clothes And now you're all I think about when I'm alone Can't wait to feel your love inside me now We'll have a drink or two and we'll go to your house I wanna fuck your love slow Catch my heart, go swim Feel your lips crush Hold you here, my loveliest friendWearing black lipstick, bleaching your hair blonde Put on your socks Cut-offs or jean shorts, vampire fangs And your "I Love New York" shirt Well, I know full well that you are The patron saint of sucking cock Señorita, you're a cheater Well, so am I You wanna go where the girls are young and dumb And hot as fuck Where they're dancing in the streets With nothing on We'll drive your car to the beach with this song on repeat You showed me We'll drive your car to the beach with this song on repeat Oh, baby My heart is racing watching you kiss him On my guitar Faking the teardrop by spraying my eye with That water gunIt's making you cry every time You give your love to me this way Saying you'd wait for me to stay I know it hurts you But I need to tell you something My heart just can't be faithful for long I swear I'll only make you cry Maybe I'd change for you someday But I can't help the way I feel Wish I was good Wish that I could give you my love now But I need to tell you something My heart just can't be faithful for long I swear I'll only make you cry I need to tell you something My heart just can't be faithful for long I swear I'll only make you cryEach time you fall in love It's clearly not enough You sleep all day and drive out in L.A It isn't safe And each time you kiss a girl You never know what it's worth You say all of the words they wanna hear It isn't real She took you for a ride in summer, baby Lost all your money to her All I wanna know is if you love her How come you never give in Each time you have a dream You never know what it means You see that open road and never know which way to go And each time you fall in love It's clearly not enough You sleep all day and drive out in L.A It isn't safe She took you for a ride in summer, baby Lost all your money to her All I wanna know is if you love her How come you never give in
