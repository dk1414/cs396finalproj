Back a few months ago, I was headlinin' a great big nightclub And they put me up a couple days early, I came in a couple days early And they put me up in what they call the "Star Suite"Now here I am, headlinin' in one of the biggest nightclubs In the country and I wake up at eight o'clock in the morning In this "Star Suite" all by myself Crowd: Awwww Mac: Yeah, that's what I said, "Awwwww."But I did what I've always done, man, to cheer myself up I picked up my guitar, I sat down and I wrote me a little song Now this is how it feels to be alone at the top of the hill Tryin' to figure out why Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble When you're perfect in every way I can't wait to look in the mirror'Cause I get better lookin' each day To know me is to love me I must be a hell of a man Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble But I'm doin' the best that I can I was just fifteen and outta control Lost to James Dean and rock and roll I knew down deep in my country soul That I had to get away Hollywood was a lady in red Who danced in my dreams As I tossed in bed I knew I'd wind up In jail or dead If I had to stay I thought happiness Was Lubbock, Texas In my rear view mirror My momma kept calling me home But I just did not want to hear her And the vision was getting clearer In my dreams So I laid out one night in June Stoned on the glow of the Texas moon Humming an old Buddy Holly tune Called Peggy Sue With my favorite jeans And a cheap guitar>Memories Pressed between the pages of my mind Memories Sweetened through the ages just like wine Quiet thoughts come floating down And settle softly to the ground Like golden autumn leaves around my feet I touched them and they burst apart with Sweet memories Sweet memories Of lollipops and red bouquets And twilights trimmed in purple haze And laughing eyes and simple ways And quiet nights and gentle days with you Memories I cling to them and tremble to the dawn My memories Are all that I have left Now that you’ve gone Oh, what would I do without my Sweet memories…>Living all by yourself ain't bad at all Once you get used to it Chicken pot pies and T V dinners And Million Dollar Movies ain’tbad at all Once you get used to it Tryin’ to sleep alone at night Ain’t bad if you got an extra pillow To hold against your breast in case you cry When you find in the morning light That your pillow’s still just a plain ol’ pillow It ain’t bad if you don’t start wondering’ why You let it all slip by Living all by yourself ain't bad at all Once you get used to it Smokin’ cigarettes and pickin’ your guitar Starin’ at the telephone That ain’t bad at all, oh no Once you get used to it Playin’ with other people’s kids ain’t bad If you just don’t let them catch you Callin’ them by someone else’s name‘Cause sometimes other people’s kids Have got a way of lookin’ at you They can tell with you it ain’t no game They can see the painWell, I scorched your favourite pan this morning, trying to make some pancakes Spilled the grease and had to stop and mop the floor Sat there like a little baby crying in my cornflakes I don't think that I can take it any more Baby, come home--this is the lonesomest lonesome I've ever known Late last night I woke up trembling, with my arms wrapped 'round your pillow And a lump as big as Texas in my throat Sat there in the dark and played my guitar 'til the sun came up And wrote the saddest song I ever wrote Baby, come home--this is the lonesomest lonesome I've ever known Lonesomest lonesome, oh, the saddest sad The loneliest I've ever been alone You've been the best thing this poor boy ever had And now you're gone Well, tonight I'm going to get down on my knees and say a prayer For the first time since I can't remember when Maybe if I'm lucky, when I wake up in the morning You'll be soft and warm beside me once again Baby, come home--this is the lonesomest lonesome Lonesomest lonesome I've ever known Lonesomest lonesome...--- I can still remember When I bought my first guitar Remember just how good the feeling To put it proudly in my car And my fam'ly listened fifty times To my two song repertoire I told my mom Her only son was gonna be a star Bought all the Beatles records I sounded just like Paul I bought all the old Chuck Berry's 78's and all I sat by my record player Playing ev'ry note they played I watched them all on T VMaking ev'ry move they made Rock and roll, I gave you all The best years of my life All the dreamy sunny Sundays All the moonlit summer nights I was so busy in the backroom Writing love songs to you While you were changing your direction And you never even knew That I was always just one step behind you'66 seemed like the year I was really going somewhere;We were living in San Francisco With flowers in our hair Singing songs of kindness So the world would understand To the guys and me you were something more Than just another band And then sixty-nine in L  A Came around so soon We were really making headway And writing lots of tunes And we must have played The wildest stuff that we had ever played And the way the crowds cried out for us We thought we had it made Rock and roll, I gave you all The best years of my life All the crazy, lazy, young days All the magic moon at night I was so busy on the road Singing love songs to you While you were changing your direction And you never even knew That I was always just one step behind you Seventy-one and so alone When I met Susanne I was trying to go it solo With someone else's band She came up to me later And I took her by the hand And I told her all my troubles And she seemed to understand And she followed me through London Through a hundred hotel rooms Through a hundred record companies Who didn't like my tunes;She followed me when finally I sold my old guitar She tried to help me Understand I'd never be a star Rock and roll, I gave you All the best years of my life All the dreamy, sunny Sundays All the moonlit summer nights And though I never knew The magic of making it with you That I thank the Lord for giving me The little bit I knew And I was always just one step behind youGirl, you're getting that look in your eyes And it's starting to worry me I ain't ready for no family ties Nobody's gonna hurry me Just keep it friendly, girl Cause I don't wanna leave Don't start clinging to me, girl Cause I can't breathe Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me, oooh Cause I'll just use you Then I'll set you free Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me Girl, you're a hot-blooded woman-child And it's warm where you're touching me But I can tell by your trembling smile You're seein' way too much in me Girl, don't let your life get tangled up with mine Cause I'll just leave you I can't take no clinging vineThere he sits with a pen and a yellow pad What a handsome lad That's my boy BR LF Q spells mom and dad But that ain't too bad That's my boy You can have your T V and you nightclubs And you can have your drive in picture show I'll stay here with my little man near We'll listen to the radio Biding my time and Watching Scotty grow Making a castle out of building blocks And a cardboard box That's my boy Mickey Mouse says it's thirteen o'clock Well that's quite a shock!That's my boy In four short years I've gone from rags to riches And what I did before that I don't know So let it rain on my windowpane I got my own rainbow And we're sitting here shining Watching Scotty grow Riding on daddy's shoulders off to bed Old sleepy head That's my boy Got to have a drink of water and a story read A teddy bear named Fred That's my boy What's that you say momma Come on and keep you feet warm Well save me a place I'll be there in a minute or so I'll think I'll stay right here and Say a little prayer before I go Me and God Watching Scotty grow Me and God Watching Scotty grow.. Staring at the Fire Listening for the phone God knows I don't ever remember Feeling so alone You sit by the window Listening to the wind Dreaming of the days gone by When you and I were friends*Cause yesterday seems like Two million miles away Our lives have gone astray We've run out of things to say And the way we used to be Is just a bitter sweet memory We're both blind and we can't see That I still love you You still love me...In the dark hours of the morning Lately I don't sleep so warm Feels like I've been lying here With the stranger in my armsThere he sits with a pen and a yellow pad What a handsome lad That's my boy BR LF Q spells mom and dad But that ain't too bad That's my boy You can have your T V and you nightclubs And you can have your drive in picture show I'll stay here with my little man near We'll listen to the radio Biding my time and Watching Scotty grow Making a castle out of building blocks And a cardboard box That's my boy Mickey Mouse says it's thirteen o'clock Well that's quite a shock!That's my boy In four short years I've gone from rags to riches And what I did before that I don't know So let it rain on my windowpane I got my own rainbow And we're sitting here shining Watching Scotty grow Riding on daddy's shoulders off to bed Old sleepy head That's my boy Got to have a drink of water and a story read A teddy bear named Fred That's my boy What's that you say momma Come on and keep you feet warm Well save me a place I'll be there in a minute or so I'll think I'll stay right here and Say a little prayer before I go Me and God Watching Scotty grow Me and God Watching Scotty grow..
