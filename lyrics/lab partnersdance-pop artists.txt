Can I call you up at two Can I sleep the morning through I really miss the after hours And can I call you from New York Ask me when I'm coming home Tell me that you'll leave the light on Can we pretend that we're not done Will you tell me I'm the one I really miss the rain and flowersBless it up Intoxicated, intoxicated Everything I take is medicated From the codeine to the Mary Jane it's It's all intoxicating, it's all intoxicating The things I'm taking changed the way my brain is If I'm not careful I might end up brainless My nigga in the back rolling a zoot My nigga turning that Bucky to blue You heard that we wavey tell me something new I'm bunning like I ain't got no work to do The top of the walls what a beautiful view I passed her my cup now she feeling my groove She told me she wanna come back to my zoo And smoke all the trees around my living room I told myself I'd quit last year Been smoking louder since last year Was mixing them spirits with Sprite and some sizzy They asked I pled the fifth last year Spent half my time all lit last year Made hits flicking my wrist last year The boy been blessed I took away the stress I got way too faded quick last year She said tell me what you want, what you really really want A stage to put all my people on A drink that'll leave half my face feeling numb So when Abel comes on, I relate to the song Yeah I'm X CV I'm probably danking of weed The worlds moving sidewayss Everyting bookey when I'm off that leanShe got me feeling x 6 She got me feeling high, she got me feeling high yo My head's up in the sky, my head's up in the sky yo She got me feeling high, she got me feeling yo I'm sleeping on cloud 9, I'm sleeping on cloud 9 yo She got me feeling high To get out of the lows lows Was down to take the ride But she a crazy nyoso I'm tryna fly the tide And only cause I'm pro slow I'm leaning through the clouds And purple's in the Ozone And green up in my eyes I'm leaning like old so Don't leave me high to dry I'm feeling kinda cold yo The world's about to end And I'm too fucked to know Man ain't got no fucking friends Just all these bloody chemicals Some codeine and some sprite Some M D on the table This ain't every single night Just when we ain't stable No we ain't living right Been poisoned by that cable Ain't fucking with that caine That shit that fucked with AbelCan I call you up at two Can I
