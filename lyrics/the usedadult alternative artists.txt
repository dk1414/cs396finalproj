Is it worth it  Can you even hear me Standing with your spotlight on me Not enough to feed the hungry I'm tired, and I felt it for a while now In this sea of lonely The taste of ink is getting old, it's Four o' clock in the fucking morning Each day gets more and more like the last day Still I can see it coming While I'm standing in the river drowning This could be my chance to break out This could be my chance to say goodbye At last, it's finally over Couldn't take this town much longer Being half-dead wasn't what I planned to be Now I'm ready to be free So here I am, it's in my hands And I'll savor every moment of this So here I am, alive at last And I'll savor every moment of this Don't you think I'm pretty When I'm standing top the bright-lit city And I'll take your hand and pick you up And keep you there so you can see it So long as you're alive and care I promise I will take you there We'll drink and dance the night away We can drink and dance the night awaySmall, simple, safe price Rise the wake and carry me with all of my regrets This is not a small cut that scabs, and dries, and flakes, and heals And I am not afraid to die I'm not afraid to bleed and fuck and fight I want the pain of payment What's left, but a section of pygmy-size cuts Much like a slew of a thousand unwanted fucks Would you be my little cut Would you be my thousand fucks And make mark leaving space for the guilt to be liquid To fill and spill over and under my thoughts My sad, sorry, selfish cry out to the cutter I'm cutting trying to picture your black, broken heart Love is not like anything Especially a fucking knife Look at me, you can tell By the way I move and do my hair Do you think that it's me or it's not me I don't even care I'm alive, I don't smell I'm the cleanest I have ever been I feel big, I feel tall, I feel dry DrySo deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me Off guard, red handed, now I'm far from lonely Asleep, I still see you lying next to me So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me, ahh I need something else, would someone please just give me Hit me, and knock me out and let me go back to sleep I can laugh all I want, inside I still am empty So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me, ahh I'll be just fine Pretending I'm not I'm far from lonely And it's all that I've got I'll be just fine Pretending I'm not I'm far from lonely And it's all that I've got I guess I remember every glance you shot me Unharmed, I'm losing weight and some body-heat I squoze so hard, I stopped your heart from beating So deep that I didn't even scream, fuck me, ahhAnd it's all in how you mix the two And it starts just where the light exists It's a feeling that you cannot miss It burns a hole Through everyone that feels it Well, you're never gonna find it If you're looking for it Won't come your way, yeah Well, you'll never find it If you're looking for it Should've done something, but I've done it enough By the way your hands were shaking Rather waste some time with you And you never would have thought, in the end How amazing it feels just to live again It's a feeling that you cannot miss And it burns a hole Through everyone that feels itKickin' it out  Your dream vacation Is my hostage refuge A work in progress You bleed just like you puke while running a mile I beg to differ Make me an offer Warm summer rain You bleed just like you puke while running a mile Hey, are you okay You look pretty low Very handsome awkward Do you feel okay You look pretty low Very handsome awkward Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah!Yeah  Yeah  Handsome awkwardHe wears his heart safety-pinned to his backpack His backpack is all that he knows Shot down by strangers whose glances can cripple The heart and devour the soul All alone, he turns to stone While holding his breath half to death Terrified of what's inside, to Save his life, he crawls like a worm from a bird Crawls like a worm from a bird Don't tell on me, don't tell on me No, don't you tell on me, please It's okay, don't tell on me, please...Out of his mind, the weight pushes him, whisperin'Must've been out of his mind Mid-day delusions of pushing this out of his head May be out of his mind All alone, he turns to stone While holding his breath half to death Terrified of what's inside, to Save his life, he crawls like a worm Crawls like a worm from a bird  Crawls like a worm from a bird Crawls like a worm from a bird Crawls like a worm Crawls like a worm from a birdOne, two, three, four!As of now, I'm down straight up And I can turn to the box for some peace Or a box for a piece Or a box for a smoke But they're all going to choke me As of now, I'm down straight up And I can turn to the box for some peace Or a box for a piece Or a box for a smoke But they're all going to choke me You're so crazy You're so crazy You're so crazy Enough in a way that I'll probably say you destroyed me It's like a fucking drug deal I'm sitting here waiting I'm calling you back And you won't call me back And it's fucked up But at the same time it just made me want you even worseYou almost always pick the best times to drop the worst lines You almost made me cry again this time Another false alarm, red flashing lights Well, this time I'm not going' watch myself die I think I made it a game to play your game and let myself cry Buried myself alive on the inside, so I could shut you out And let you go away for a long timeâ€¦ God!I guess it's okay I puked the day away I guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own way And if you want me back, you're gonna have to ask I think the chain broke away and I felt it the day That I had my own time I took advantage of myself and felt fine But it was worth the night I caught an early flight And I made it home I guess it's okay I puked the day away I guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own way And if you want me back, you're gonna have to ask Nicer than that, nicer than that My foot on your neck, I finally have you Right where I want you, right where I want you Right where I want you, right where I want youIt's our time to shine Through the down Glorified by what is ours We've fallen in love We've fallen in love It was the best idea I ever had Today I fell, and felt better Just knowing this matters I just feel stronger And sharper!Found a box of sharp objects, what a beautiful Today I fell, and felt better Just knowing this matters I just feel stronger And sharper!Found a box of sharp objects, what a beautiful thing!Today I fell, and felt better Just knowing this matters I just feel stronger And sharper!Found a box of sharp objects, what a beautiful thing!Do you want a song of glory Well, I'm fucking screaming at you Just baptized It called me, I should have known As the fever sweat through the dream Told mamma that I couldn't go So I could stay home just to watch him dancing And you could not tell me then Like you could never, ever tell me now That this is not who I am Plans were made while my back was turned Said Baby, that is no way to live Showed me that carrot on a string but just a little too late The bite from the taste and the smell of the sick somehow reminds me to be myself Over and over again Over and over again Over and over again Over and over again"Wanna be starting something" taught me to sing Or maybe kiss, kiss Molly's lips On a plain he will always live And in a round he will always be dancing Imagine where I'd be now On these four legs I stand proud It's the only way I know how to give
