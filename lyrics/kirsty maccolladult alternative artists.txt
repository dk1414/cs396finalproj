I was twenty-one years when I wrote this song I'm twenty-two now, but I won't be for long People ask me when will I grow up to understand Why the girls I knew at school are already pushing prams I loved you then as I love you still Though I put you on a pedestal, you put me on the pill I don't feel bad about letting you go I just feel sad about letting you know I don't want to change the world I'm not looking for a new England Are you looking for another girl I don't want to change the world I'm not looking for a new England Are you looking for another girl I loved the words you wrote to me But that was bloody yesterday I can't survive on what you send Every time you need a friend I saw two shooting stars last night I wished on them, but they were only satellites It's wrong to wish on space hardware I wish, I wish, I wish you'd careI once met a man with a sense of adventure He was dressed to thrill, wherever he went He said: Let's make love on a mountain top Under the stars on a big hard rock I said: In these shoes I don't think so I said: Honey, let's do it here So I'm sitting at a bar in Guadalajara In walks a guy with a faraway look in his eyes He said: I've got a poweful horse outside Climb on the back, I'll take you for a ride I know a little place, we can get there for the break of day I said: In these shoes No way, Jose I said: Honey, let's stay right here No le gusta caminar, no puede montar a caballo Como se puede bailar - es un escandolo Then I met an Englishman Oh, he said...Won't you walk up and down my spine It makes me feel strangely alive I said: In these shoes I doubt you'd survive I said: Honey, let's do it You've been around for such a long time now Oh, maybe I could leave you but I don't know how And why should I be lonely every night When I can be with you, oh yes, you make it right And I don't listen to the guys who say That you're bad for me and I should turn you away'Cause they don't know about us And they've never heard of love I get a feeling when I look at you Wherever you go now, I wanna be there too They say we're crazy but I just don't care And if they keep on talkin', still they get nowhere So I don't mind if they don't understand When I look at you and you hold my hand'Cause they don't know about us And they've never heard of love Why should it matter to us if they don't approve We should just take our chances while we've got nothing to lose Baby There's no need for living in the past Now I found good loving, gonna make it last I tell the others not to bother me'Cause when they look at you they don't see what I seeOh you shouldn't have kissed me and got me so excited And when you asked me out I really was delighted So we went to a pub in Belsize Park And we cheered on England as the sky grew dark Oh you shouldn't have kissed me cause you started a fire But then I found out that you're a serial liar You lied about your status You lied about your life You never mentioned your three children And the fact you have a wife Now it's England 2 Colombia 0 And I know just how those Colombians feel If you hadn't passed out while I was talking to your friend It could have really ended badly cause you very nearly had me If he hadn't taken pity on my heart full of desire I might never have found out you're a serial liar You lied about your status You lied about your life You forgot you have three children You forgot you have a wife Now it's England 2 Colombia 0 And I know just how those Colombians feelOh darling why d'you talk so fast Another evening just flew past tonight And now the daybreak's coming in And I can't win and it ain't right You tell me all you've done and seen And all the places you have been without me Well I don't really want to know But I'll stay quiet and then I'll go And you won't have no cause to think about me There's a guy works down the chip shop swears he's Elvis Just like you swore to me that you'd be true There's a guy works down the chip shop swears he's Elvis But he's a liar and I'm not sure about you Oh darling you're so popular You were the best thing new in Hicksville With your mohair suits and foreign shoes Lou says you changed your pickup for a Seville And now I'm lying here alone'Cause you're out there on the phone to some star in New York I can hear you laughing now And I can't help feeling that somehow You don't mean anything you say at all There's a guy works down the chip shop swears he's Elvis Just like you swore to me that you'd be true There's a guy works down the chip shop swears he's Elvis But he's a liar and I'm not sure about youWalking down Madison I swear I never had a gun No, I never shot no one I was only having fun Walking down Madison Swear I never had a gun I was philosophizing some Checking out the bums See you give 'em your nickels, your pennies and dimes But you can't give 'em hope in these mercenary times, oh no And you feel real guilty about the coat on your back And the sandwich you had, oh no From an uptown apartment to a knife on the A train It's not that far From the sharks in the penthouse to the rats in the basement It's not that far To the bag lady frozen asleep in the park Oh no, it's not that far Would you like to see some more I can show you if you'd like to Walking down Madison I swear I never had a gun No, I never shot no one Wouldn't do it just for funHe was just a friend of mine I'd run in to from time to time And long before he moved away We used to share a taste for wine Still I never knew that he was sad back then He said, the time had come for him to take a holiday And he says it's brilliant there There's something in the air And sunshine everywhere He's on the beach I know he's changed somehow He sends us postcards now I'm not sure where he is, but he is out of reach When he called me up one day And said that he was going away I thought he meant a week in France And not 12,000 miles to Sydney Bay Still he had to take his chances He said, the time had come, for him, to make a move away And he says it's brilliant there There's something in the air And sunshine everywhere He's on the beach I know he's changed somehow He writes us postcards now He's on his own again And he is out of reach And I don't blame him Leaving was the best thing he could do He longed for changes I just hope he's happy when he does the things he thinks he has to do And he tries, and he tries, yes he tries But he's a little bit hard on himself So now he's trying to be someone elseI just know Though I can't see But I can feel his hands all over me His hot breath on me I can't resist His rope, my wrists I never knew there might be days like this Dream on he says Dream on he says Will I be saved From these Titanic days A violent frenzy In a none too cheap hotel He says it's hazy But I remember it so well His arms, his face The way my words got twisted out of place Dream on he says Dream on he always says It's sink or swim In these Titanic days So hot so hungry So faretheewell goodbye I got so angry Now I sit here and sigh My love, always We should rejoice in these Titanic daysWhen I was just a child My folks would drive me wild They'd spy upon my every move Until it drove me to despair They told me what to wear They told me not to cut my hair But that's all over now I had to tell them anyhow It's my affair Where I go and what I do It's my affair oh yeah It's my affair It's up to me and not to you It's my affair That's the way I want to keep it I kissed the boy in secret Thrilled me to the very core I couldn't stop I wanted more and I didn't hear the door and They caught me on the floor With my affair And when we first got wed We used to stay in bed All day and night all night and day We bedded half our lives away But that's all over now We move in higher circles Chomping through the upper crust I couldn't see you for the dust And then you met that girl Who left you with your money spent And now it's no concern of yours If I sleep with the PresidentWhy'd you never listen to me I could be invisible to you Anyway it doesn't matter now'cos I have met somebody new Sorry if your heart is broken Why's your mouth just hanging open Don't look so surprised I found another guy Terry wants my photograph Terry says our love will last forever And he should know That boy terry's not the kind To mess around and change his mind Terry is as tough as marlon brando Now he's waiting for me I just had to break the news to you You'd better hide your face a while If he gets mad there's no telling what he'll do You can see the door is open So if you don't want your nose broken You had better go away'cos terry's coming round today
