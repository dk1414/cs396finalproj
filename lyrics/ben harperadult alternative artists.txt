I knew a girl Her name was truth She was a horrible liar She couldn't spend one day long But she couldn't be satisfied When you have everything You have everything to lose She made herself A bed of nails And shes plannin' on puttin' it to use Cos she had diamonds on the inside She had diamonds on the inside She had diamonds on the inside Diamonds A candle throws its light into the darkness In a nasty world,so shines the good deed Make sure the fortune, that you seek Is the fortune that you need So tell me why,the first to ask,is the last to give,everytime What you say and do not mean Follow too close behindYes indeed I'm alone again And here comes emptiness, crashing in It's either love or hate, I can't find in between'Cause I've been with witches and I've been with the queen It wouldn't have worked out anyway So now it's just another lonely day Hey, hey Further along, we just may But for now it's just another lonely day Wish there was something I, could say or do I can resist anything but, the temptation from you But I'd rather walk alone, than chase you around I'd rather fall myself than let you, drag me on down It wouldn't have worked out anyway And now it's just another lonely day Hey, hey Further along, we just may But for now it's just another lonely day Yesterday seems like a, life ago'Cause the one I loved today, I hardly know You I held so close, in my heart oh dear Grow further from me with every, falling tearDon't you get ahead of me And I won't leave you behind If you get unhappy Won't you show me a sign There's no love like lost love No pain like a broken heart There's no love like you and me And no loss like us apart Promises, promise is Only a word And when softly spoken Is never heard And a heart Is not a stone And is fragile, is fragile When alone By my side By my side Won't you be by my side By my side By my side Won't you be by my sideNot talkin' 'bout a year No not three or four I don't want that kind of forever In my life anymore Forever always seems To be around when it begins But forever never seems To be around when it ends So give me your forever Please your forever Not a day less will do From you People spend so much time Every single day Runnin' 'round all over town Givin' their forever away But no not me I won't let my forever roam And now I hope I can find My forever a home So give me your forever Please your forever Not a day less will do From youOh no, here comes that sun again That means another day without you my friend And it hurts me to look into the mirror at myself And it hurts even more to have to be with somebody else And it's so hard to do and so easy to say But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away Walk away So many people to love in my life Why do I worry about one But you put the happy in my ness You put the good times into my fun And it's so hard to do and so easy to say But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away Walk away And head for the door We've tried the goodbyes So many days We walk in the same direction So that we could never stray They say if you love somebody Then you have got to set them free But I would rather be locked to you than live in this pain and miseryExcuse me mister, do you have the time Or are you so important that it stands still for you Excuse me mister, won't you lend me your ears Or are you not only blind but do you not hear Excuse me mister, but isn't that your oil in the sea And the pollution in the air mister, who's could that be So excuse me mister, but I'm a mister too And you're giving mister a bad name, mister like you So I'm taking the Mr  from out in front of your name Cuz it's the mister like you that puts the rest of us to shame It's the mister like you that puts the rest of us to shame And I, I've seen enough I've seen enough to know That I've seen too much Excuse me mister, can't you see the children dying You say that you can help them mister, you're not even trying Excuse me mister, just take a look around Oh mister, just look up and you will, you will see it coming down Excuse me mister but I'm a- I'm a mister too Your giving mister a bad name, mister like you So I'm taking the Mr  from out in front of your name Cuz it's the mister like you that puts the rest of us to shame It's the mister like you putting the rest of us to shameLet us burn one From end to end And pass it over To me my friend Burn it long, we'll burn it slow To light me up before I go{Chorus]If you don't like my fire Then don't come around Cause I'm gonna burn one down Yes I'm gonna burn one down Yeah My choice is what I choose to do And if I'm causing no harm It shouldn't bother you Your choice is who you choose to be And if you're causin' no harm Then you're alright with me{Chorus]If you don't like my fire Then don't come around Cause I'm gonna burn one down Yes I'm gonna burn one downI wish we could live forever Then melt into the sun Melt into the sun Time is gonna change you Once it gets you on the run Gets you on the run There will be There will be There will be a light There will be a light There will be There will be There will be a light There will be a light I've been running Ever since Ever since I was a child Some call it free And some call it wild There will be There will be There will be a lightHow I am strong Is to know what makes me weak How I am found Is to know just whom I seek The gift of a blessing The burden of a sin Oh, turn, turn to him I wanna be ready I wanna be ready I wanna be ready Ready to put on my long, white robe Nailed across From hand to hand For the sin Of every woman and man And all upon his earth Is all within his plan And I know This shall be my journey home I wanna be ready I wanna be ready I wanna be ready Ready to put on my long, white robeTell me do you really know Your brother man Cause a heart speaks louder Than a colour can And why would you even Shake a man's hand If you're not going To help him stand Jah work Jah work Jah work is never done Every man's actions Belong to him If prepared for thereafter To reach his destiny Some people believe And some people know Some people deceive And some people show Jah work Jah work Jah work is never done is never done
