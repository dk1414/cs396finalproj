Lazy yellow moon comin' up tonight Shinin' through the trees Crickets are singin' and lightnin' bugs Are floatin' on the breeze Baby get ready Across the field where the crick turns back By the old stone road I'm gonna take you to a special place That nobody knows Baby get ready Ooh, ooh You and me goin' fishin' in the dark Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars Where the cool grass grows Down by the river in the full moonlight We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night Just movin' slow Stayin' the whole night through Feels so good to be with you Spring is almost over and the summer's comin'The days are gettin' long Waited all winter for the time to be right Just to take you along Baby get readyI knew a man Bojangles and he'd dance for you In worn out shoes With silver hair, and ragged shirt, and baggy pants The old soft shoe He jumped so high, jumped so high Then he’d lightly touch down I met him in a cell in New Orleans I was Down and out He looked to me to be the eyes of age As the smoke ran out He talked of life, talked of life, laughed Clicked his heels and stepped He said his name "Bojangles" and he danced a lick Across the cell He grabbed his pants and feathered stance Oh he jumped so high and then he clicked his heels He let go a laugh, let go a laugh Shook back his clothes all around Mr  Bojangles, Mr  Bojangles Mr  Bojangles, dance He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs Throughout the south He spoke through tears of 15 years how his dog and him Traveled about The dog up and died, he up and died After 20 years he still grievesI beg your pardon, mama, what did you say My mind was drifting off on Martinique Bay It's not that I'm not interested, you see Augusta, Georgia is just no place to be I think Jamaican in the moonlight Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night We got no money, mama, but we can go We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove Keep on talking, mama, I can hear Your voice, it tickles down inside of my ear I feel a tropical vacation this year Might be the answer to this hillbilly beer I think Jamaican in the moonlight Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night We got no money, mama, but we can go We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove Voila  An American dream Well, we can travel girl, without any means When it's as easy as closing your eyes And dream Jamaica is a big neon signThere is a time for love and laughter The days will pass like summer storms The winter winds will follow after But there is love and love is warm There is a time for us to wander When time is young and so are we The woods are greener over yonder The path is new, the world is green There is a time when leaves are falling The woods are grey, the paths are old The snow will come when geese are calling You need a fire against the cold There is a time for us to wander When time is young and so are we The woods are greener over yonder The path is new, the world is green So do you roamin’ in the springtime ?And you find your love in the summer sun The frost will come and bring the harvest And you can sleep when day is done Time is like a river flowin'With no regrets as it moves on Around each bend the shinin’ mornin’And all our friends we though were goneI don't need the same excuses All this talk is really useless You run for cover Everytime I'm close to you Don't want to hear about the others There's something here we should discover Let's make a little magic Before the night is through Oh, you've seen it all before And heard the same lines But if you're willing to take a chance It could be all right, so fine We'll find ourselves dancing by firelight So don't you try to change the subject Or try to put yourself above it A boy could get pneumonia sitting next to you That's true A little sleep is all we're losing It's up to us to do the choosing Let's make a little magic before the night is through Make a little magic before the night is throughI was standing by my window On one cold and cloudy day When I saw that hearse come rolling For to carry my mother away Will the circle be unbroken By and by, Lord, by and by There's a better home a-waiting In the sky, Lord, in the sky I said to that undertaker Undertaker please drive slow For this lady you are carrying Lord, I hate to see her go Will the circle be unbroken By and by, Lord, by and by There's a better home a-waiting In the sky, Lord, in the sky Oh, I followed close behind her Tried to hold up and be brave But I could not hide my sorrow When they laid her in the grave Will the circle be unbroken By and by, Lord, by and by There's a better home a-waiting In the sky, Lord, in the skyWell, I got a home on the other shore Don't you hear Jerusalem moan I know I'll live there forevermore Don't you hear Jerusalem moan Don't you hear Jerusalem moan Don't you hear Jerusalem moan Thank God there's a heaven and a ringing in my soul, and my soul's set free Don't you hear Jerusalem moan It's a hard road to walk and a mighty long way Don't you hear Jerusalem moan But your feet will get to flying when your soul is saved Don't you hear Jerusalem moan Don't you hear Jerusalem moan Don't you hear Jerusalem moan Thank God there's a heaven and a ringing in my soul, and my soul's set free Don't you hear Jerusalem moan Well, a Baptist preacher sure knows his Bible Don't you hear Jerusalem moan He's on a first-name basis with the saints inside it Don't you hear Jerusalem moan There's no such thing as sleep for jealous fools And being jealous about someone like you is sort of foolish too The life you choose is the life you want, I guess Losin' you might be the best thing yet The longest day I live, I'll still be sufferin' from the shame In the gutter, you were makin' yourself quite a name I wanted you, you wanted anyone you could get Losin' you might be the best thing yet Patiently, I sit alone and wait Knowing where you were  and what you are doin' turned my love to hate My foolishness is all that I regret Losin' you might be the best thing yet The longest day I live, I'll still be sufferin' from the shame And in the gutter, you were makin' yourself quite a name I wanted you and you wanted anyone you could get Losin' you might be the best thing yet Losin' you might be the best thing yetSat here by this stony brook until the gray day turned to dusk When up swam a fish with a children's book thought that I was lost He was on his way to the salmon hop, that's where they go to breed Saw me sitting on this log and thought I'd like to read The night was cloudy but the moon he found a hole Said that he felt bad for me cause I had no place to go"Why aren't you at the harvest ball with some sweet young gal You just sit like a bump on the log and call that fish your pal"Well, I told him I was an orphan lived here all alone But many people have often tried to catch and take me home They never caught me!Thought that I was a'hiding, call this log my home But the fish and the moon and a sweet young gal All want me for their own The night was cloudy but the moon he found a hole Said that he felt bad for me cause I had no place to go So I met that girl at the harvest ball, she took me to her room While I slept in children's dreams, the fish ran away with the moon The fish ran away with the moon The fish ran away with the moonThe milk truck brings the sun up The paper hits the door The subway shakes my floor And I think about you It's time to face the emptiness Of another lonely day Baby, it's so hard Living without you Yes, it's so hard It's so hard It's so hard Living without you Now everyone's got something They're out tryin' to get some more They got something to get up for But I ain't about to Nothing's gonna happen There ain’t nothing's gonna change And, baby, it's so hard Living without you Yes, it's so hard It's so hard It's so hard Living without you
