She stole my heart Faster than a heat seeking missile on a mission Faster than a bass to a hook when daddy's fishing Faster than a walnut rolls off a hen house Faster than a whiskey shot goes down down south Ooh, I saw white lightning Ooh, I saw white lightning Faster than Mc Queen running them red lights Faster than the Duke boys jumping that hillside Faster than Elvis could shake, rattle, roll Faster than the skirt flyin' up on Monroe, I said Ooh, I saw white lightning, I said Ooh, I saw white lightning Ooh, I saw white lightning Faster than #3 breaking every record Faster than a tree dies in the desert Faster than that bug splattered on my windshield Faster than you die when you take too many pillsBoots and buckles, red clay and sand My point ain't subtle here, I'm a southern man Where the beer seems colder and the women seem hotter Where the world don't seem so damn modern Where a good old boy like me still has a chance Aw, this is where I was born and this is where I'll die Yeah, this is where I was born and this is where I will die It's all about the south Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Carolina Don't you wanna get down and dirty  'Cause, Florida I'm thirsty Hit me with your Tennessee whiskey and crank it up loud Laid back, crazy old timer, sweet magnolia Dive bars and diners, oh yeah Oh, and even if you're up north Come on down, come on down Oh, it's all about the south All about the south From daddy's Don Williams to mama's Patsy Cline We're walking after midnight singing Tulsa time Where the beer seems colder and the women seem hotter Where the world don't seem so damn modern This is where I was born this is where I'll die, oh that's rightTop of the world, looking at you Through a red wine haze Shaking my head, watching you dance Girl, you

new believer Hold me down, down, down, down, down Fill me up, girl, let me drown If you want my heart If you want my soul You gotta take me to the bottom Every little kiss is like Water filling up my lung Every little touch is a last breath Feeling like I'm done Slow and steady washing over me Concrete shoes just a wild sink I can see you pulling me in, yeahGet out the whiskey girl and put that
