Lois Malone!Last week I ran into, an ol' drinkin' buddy We swapped a story or two We drank one to a town, down in south Alabama One to an ol' gal we knewI picked up the paper this morning And read all the daily blues The world is one big tragedy I wonder what I can do About all the pain and injustice About all of the sorrow We're living in a danger zone The world could end tomorrow But I'm not gonna let it bother me tonight I'm not gonna let it bother me tonight Tomorrow I might go as far as suicide But I won't let it bother me tonight Life on the street is a jungle A struggle to keep up the pace I just can't beat that old dog eat dog The rats keep winnin the rat race But I'm not gonna let it bother me tonight I'm not gonna let it bother me tonight The world is in an uproar and I see no end in sight But I won't let it bother me tonight I'm not gonna let it bother me tonight Tomorrow I might go as far as suicide But I won't let it bother me tonightDon't let your troubles make you cry Don't waste a moment wonderin' why When everything goes wrong You have to go on And do it or die Do it or die now Stand your ground Don't let your bad breaks go gettin' you down Even when times get rough And you've had enough You still gotta try Do it no matter what the people say They don't even know you Die before you let them stand in your way You should know that life is a gamble all along Winners are losers who keep rollin' on So go on and roll the dice You only live twice So do it or dieMama you know, I’m not the kind to hold no grudge I don’t know who’s to blame It ain’t my place to judge But Mama you hurt me Like I never hurt before And I just can’t stand it no more I just decided, that this ain’t no way to live‘Cause loving you, takes more Then I’m prepared to give You made me cry so much My eyes are red and sore And I just can’t stand it no more Oh no, I just can’t stand it no more Mama let your light keep on shining I won’t be here, and I won’t see But I will always remember When your light used to shine for me Shine on me I begged and I pleaded But you would not hear my voice I’m only leaving ‘cause I have no other choice Gonna leave you standing On that New York city shore‘Cause I just can’t stand it no moreThe sun just went behind a cloud again Down crowded streets he walks alone He's a stranger out of place A number not a face And all day long, all day long He's feelin' like an alien Feelin' like he don't belong Have mercy, cried the alien Help him find his way back home The feelin' that he feels he can't explain Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, they're all the same He's lost and all alone A heart without a home Standin' like a statue in the rain He's feelin' like an alien Feelin' like he don't belong Have mercy, cried the alien Help him find his way back home Now, now and then we all are aliens Feelin' like we don't belong Have mercy, cried the alien Help him find his way back home
