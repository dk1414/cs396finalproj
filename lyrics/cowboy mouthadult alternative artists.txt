I got no reason for the things I fear The things that plague me when I see and hear A dime's a nickel and a nickel's none I'll throw myself into the Sunday sun A summer Sunday when you went insane You said you're going and I said I came I'm throwing oranges in an apple cart The ties that bind are tearing me apart Jenny says turn off the radio Jenny says turn out the light Jenny says turn off the video You beat yourself up to bring yourself down Let it go  Let it go  Let it go!Let it go  Let it go  Let it go!When the world is coming down on me I let it go!I got no reason for the things I say She turned toward me then she turned away There's lot of forces in a modern world That take a toll upon a modern girl I got no reason for the things I fear The things that plague me when I see and hear I'll press my finger on an itchy trigger What once was small right now is so much biggerHey!Hey!Hey!Hey!She had all the tattoos and the piercings Hates everything says everybody's wrong She dressed like she slept with Guns nÂ´ Roses But I busted her singing all the boy-band songs She had to go simply because And I let her go like she never was Cause I didn't know And I don't care what she does She had to go'Cause she didn't know who Joe Strummer was Hey!At night when we stood in line for hours Waiting to see my favorite punk rock band I bled with the passion and the power But she's only there for all the fashion trends With her clueless friendsIt's four a.m., I'm drunk and alone Trying to call you on a public phone I wanted passion, I wanted desire My heart is a flame that pains me If I do not light it on fire If I do not light it on fire If I do not light it on fire If I do not light it on fire I'm the perfect picture of a perfect fool You're out doing what I wanted you to I'm in the heartbreak hotel and there's a desk clerk for hire My heart is a flame that pains me If I do not light it on fire If I do not light it on fire If I do not light it on fire If I do not light it on fire How can I tell you Just how it feels How do you make love stay And how do you know if what's staying is real I was the one full of whiskey and talk I was the one with the skip in his walk You say the truth hurts, yeah well, so does a lie My heart is a flame that pains me Light it on fire If I do not light it on fire If I do not light it on fire If I do not light  Bless my soul Tell me

couldn't read between the lines I'll have another cup of coffee if you don't mind Well her hair is as black as an alleyway And it used to be red and it used to be blonde Truth is, her hair changes color all the time I'll have another cup of coffee if you don't mind I'll have another cup of coffee if you don't mind Well, I'm starin at her shoulder but it's not what I see When I hear two fellas fighting in the booth across from me So I wipe away the ashes from an empty Cobra seat And I wished I wasn't homesick, and I wish I was asleep Well, I hold her like a blanket up against my chin And I need her like I need another pack of chewing gum Well, we used to be like that, now we're like this all the time I'll have another cup of coffee if you don't mind I'll have another cup of coffee if you don't mind I'll have another cup of coffee if you don't mindTurn off your mind, relax And float down stream It is not dying It is not dying Lay down all thought Surrender to the void It is shining It is shining That you may see The meaning of within It is being It is being That love is all And love is everyone It is knowing It is knowing That ignorance and hate May mourn the dead It is believing It is believing But listen to the Color of your dreams It is not living It is not livingWhy ya wanna do me like ya do, like ya do Why ya wanna do me like ya do I never done nothin' to you Why ya wanna do me like ya do, like ya do, brother Why ya wanna-I'll ride around your country I'll ride around your town Don't tell me where your going 'cause Anywhere you're going, buddy I'm bound Don't talk about your passion Don't talk about your pain Don't talk about my station It doesn't really help the situation Why ya wanna do me like ya do, like ya do Why ya wanna do me like ya do I never done nothin' to you Why ya wanna do me like ya do, like ya do, brother Why ya wanna-I'll ride around your city I'll ride around yo' street Don't tell me where your headed 'cause Anywhere you're headed, buddy-I'll meet Don't talk about your passion Don't talk about your pride Don't talk about my stationIn the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines Sprung from cages on Highway 9 Chrome-wheeled, fuel-injected and steppin' way over the line Oh, baby, this town rips the bones from your back It's a death trap It's a suicide rap Y'gotta get out while you're young'Cause tramps like us, baby, we were born to run Wendy, let me in, I wanna be your friend I wanna guard your dreams and your visions Just wrap your legs 'round my velvet rims And strap your hands 'cross my engines Together we could break this trap We'll run 'til we drop, and, baby, we'll never go back Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire 'Cause, baby, I'm a scared and lonely rider But I gotta find out how it feels I wanna know if love is wild I wanna know if love is real Can you show me Beyond the palace, hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors, and the boys try to look so hard The amusement park rises bold and stark, kids are huddled on the beach in the mist I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the street tonight in an everlasting kissGirl with a fever, she's hot to the touch Looks so fragile to the rest of us She's gone gone gone Gone gone gone Long gone Blue cotton dress and the soft blonde hair Waking up wondering how I'd ever got there She's gone gone gone Gone gone gone Long gone We used to count the hours We'd be kissing Watch the beads of sweat drip On my body's glistening Once we were sleeping under the desert sky Dreaming of leaving on the fourth of July She's gone gone gone Gone gone gone Long gone Slip the postcard addressed to me Sunset fading on a cactus tree She's gone gone gone Gone gone gone Long gone Hello, Mrs  Johnson You self-righteous woman Sunday school teacher What brings you out slumming Do you reckon the preacher Would approve where you are Standing here, visiting a backsliding Christian In a neighborhood bar Well, yeah, that's my bottle And that's my glass And I see you're eyeballing My sweet, little lass It ain't none of your business But yes, she's with me So, leave us alone, you self-righteous woman Just let us be The Lord knows I'm drinking And running around He don't need your loud mouth Informing the town The Lord knows I'm sinning And sinning it right But me and the good Lord Are having a good talk, later tonight Yeah, oh, ah Go, come on, play that thing
