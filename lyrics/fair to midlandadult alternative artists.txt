Take a little dive into the shallow and spy, what do you see I see the tortoise and hare in a rat race And it fits like a glove under my sleeve Just wait 'til then Their heads are the heaviest in operation He's still not lost imagination You can hear him mouth the whole ending Just wait 'til then We Marys had ourselves a ball, oh, yes we did We Marys had ourselves a ball, I must admit Hang us, those limbs hold no virtue Those told to hold, project on my cue Until we fall Whether a he or a she, put your mouth where your money is And are the birds of a feather that clever If I knew I'd keep locks, that's a given Just wait 'til then Their heads cast shadows like skyscrapers But they're still small enough to fit up their asses To put it all into perspective With definitionListen to me Hey rikki tikki, rikki tikki, rikki tikki tavi I am not a machine so don't treat me like buttons Rikki tikki, rikki tikki, rikki tikki tavi We're not identical twins so don't finish my sentence Tell me the truth or don't tell me anything I'd rather have heart than courage or a brain Rikki tikki, rikki tikki, rikki tikki tavi Don't pay any mind to a voice behind curtains If you meet the devil's wife Make sure you wear a suit and tie And leave him where he stands And if he tries to shake your hand Just hit him with her frying pan And leave him where he stands Listen to me Rikki tikki, rikki tikki, rikki tikki tavi If you want a picasso, you better start diggin'Rikki tikki, rikki tikki, rikki tikki tavi If i build the ark will you wait for the water The only thing that ever turned him blue Was thinking the sky is what he should be turning to Rikki tikki, rikki tikki, rikki tikki tavi There are snakes in the grass so we better go hunting If you meet the devil's wife Make sure you wear a suit and tie And leave him where he stands If he tries to shake your hand Just hit him with her frying pan And leave him where he stands Let her take the kitchen sink And cut her from her apron strings Just leave him where he stands All you need is amnesty So grab my hand and come with me Just leave him where he stands RikkiAye, aye, aye, a-yeah You should be counting your blessings From the sky, your eagle eyes found the great blind faith I could be kickin' the bucket But you should know I never had very good aim The right of way Is a wild goose chase It makes you wonder If shooting for stars is like darts in the dark It makes you wonder If the beaten path Is the promised land And if I worship the ground that he walks on And it winds up that he has two left feet Will we be walkin' on water 'Cause you should know We never like to get our feet wetStay close if you wanna keep up But don't dare turn around Go ahead, find a bull's-eye my friend But know you're gonna get the horn A yellow belly's never havin' the guts But god, how he gets the glory The West was won from a cheater with a gun And I hope he never lives it down Yeah, yea-yeah, yeah Yeah, yea-yeah, yeah Minced words from anonymous cowards Fell down from kingdom come The threatened source of this obstacle course Had us cornered in a guessing game Every attempt turn a kettle of fish And loves makin' its waves If I had to guess, he's still makin' a mess Worse than any thunderstormSplendidly weaved from an atom bomb Retrieved from a teleprompt Practical, you are not Break the ice with a cotton swab A fever that cools us all Handshake's a contact sport No one was waiting to throw out the pilot We float on the back of the winds that you send us Another tomorrow Shedding the shade we made yesterday Disguised as the lightning Dissolving all of the thunder there Appeasing our monsters Under the acrylic sky Another tomorrow Another tomorrow Grab my hand, here comes the crash I live for the strong impact That renders both our airbags Takes every letter you send Don't fold if you're made to bend Rekindle the feud againLucky are the leaves of the clover She's digging for chemistry, with the butcher's tools Shifty are the eyes of the gambler He's making his tricks his trade, and a job well done Through the motions, waving wishes To your confidence And eloquence He's turning a-green from these envious glorious things Applied ambitious faith That can keep us all safe Invoking a blue, that's meant for us too What small amazing things we will turn to rain Lucky is a deer in the headlights Those two are as thick as thieves, not a penny more Shaky are the hands of the gun shy He'd rather give up the ghost, than stick by Through the motions, waving wishes To your confidence And eloquenceFrom hand to heart and hands to head These gritty teeth grind gears of infrared He crash lands in dull white noise All I hear is static in his voice When those sweet red hands Start their whirlwinds And you're the drain You're imagining things Your pretend machine Has sticks in its every spoke You're inventing it all From thin air and close calls Welcome to the balancing act Your rabbit's foot is hare and hounds And I drag pianos, eyes glued to the ground When he dialed 911 Busy signals sang familiar songs Those sweet red hands Start their whirlwinds And you're the plane You're imagining things Your pretend machine Has sticks in its every spoke You're inventing it all From thin air and close calls If we bought the stock we'd be brokeLadies and gentlemen We are in a little bit of a predicament He said take your time But didn't back his words Heroes and holy ghosts Which one of you steps on the others' toes And then risks his neck like It's a moving target Was that just you being stubborn Can't you say pretty please Wasn't it an eggshell carpet That brought you to your knees If the right built the anchor And the wrong have set sail I'm a whale, I'm a whale, I'm a whale Busy bees and worry-worts We are not in the business of fireworks Or turning heads that whistle in the dark Sitting ducks and guinea pigs Are the first to catch word Of straws in the wind, don't stop them Remember this: It's just two cents Two cents never made you richWhen you cry Try not to smile You could fill up the lake With the tears of a crocodile We were too young To be eating crow As if I would know Eleven hours 'til the electric arcs Send scorches through the sky Than the whole earth opens wide And I cannot wait for the earthquake That buries us in a warm grave The one-legged race, on our last leg The will is yours, so just take it The will is yours The will is yours I'd rather find Jesus outside of a book The same thing goes for Robin HoodLet me introduce you to a pair that strikes crude oil But I see pyrite It is the same old pattern, the goose that feeds the gander They choose to act, but not I Planting the seeds you sow Is easier than growing the rows Let's go outside and it might restore us whole More for the fire that fights for the freeze now Mechanical So then the pair proceeded, another pulse defeated Can't say that I am surprised It is the fly trap's color that caused the fall into her What is the shade that you saw Planting the seeds you sow Is easier than growing the rows Let's go outside and it might restore us whole More for the fire that fights for the freeze now
