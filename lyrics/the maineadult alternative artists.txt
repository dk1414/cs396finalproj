What would you say if you could say Everything you needed to To the one, you needed to You flash like a setting sun You come around, I come undone Can't find the sound under my tongue When I look at you I lose my voice when I look at you Can't make a noise though I'm trying to Tell you all the right words Waiting on the right words Just another lovesick afternoon Black butterflies and déjà vu Hoping for the right words Waiting for the right words Just yesterday north of L AI couldn't help but think of you Every time I think of you You crash like a rolling wave You come around I lose my brain Can't find the sound under my tongue When I look at youIn the backseat of the taxi When you told me we were only Two punch-drunk souls all tangled in the wind And in the backseat when you asked me"Is the sadness everlasting "I pulled you closer, looked at you and said"Love, I think it is"And it creeps on in To the corners of yourself Yeah, it creeps on in Until it hurts like hell And you know I never knew how much I was getting into No, I never knew how much I was getting into In the backseat of the taxi When you told me we were only Two punch-drunk souls all tangled in the wind And in the backseat when you asked me"Is the sadness everlasting "I pulled you closer, looked at you and said"Love, I think it is""I never wanna be a distraction"You say as You're unashamed and naked I feel okay all over Void of all composure And I know this may sound narcissistic I like the lips you kiss with But I want to wear your lipstick'Cause it means I got to kiss them You say you like the sound of cigarettes after sex And I say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah”One, two hits Her lips and bad behavior I'm in danger3, 4 A MThe feeling's getting stranger I'm in danger Bad behavior And I don't have time for your feelings You told me You're insecure, but don't be Stay soft, but don't be gentle It's altogether mental Let's go to a place where we can forget We haven't left the room yet You eloquently stated Leaving's overratedDearly depressed and broken hearted I'd like to let you know that boys cry too Don't let them tell you how you're feeling I wonder why nobody is asking you Are you free or are you in sorrow Are you free or are you being borrowed How do you feel What's your condition You are alive but are you living Give me your voice and I'll give it a listen Are you complete or is something missing So tell me Do your hands shake Does your heart break When the earth quakes Whatever it is Whatever it isn't Make sure that it's real Oh, now, how do you feel To all the dearly depressed and broken hearted The in-betweens and all the torn ones too You're not alone in how you're feeling I wonder why nobody is asking youHere's to now And to nothing else In a crowd All by yourself To the lows and every high The hellos and the goodbyes In this moment, I could die with you Never felt like this before Dizzy, drunk, and beautiful In this moment, I let go with you When you are next to me and the music's loud Singing 'Hey Nineteen' somewhere in the crowd We're up so high They can't touch us now We are thousands of feet from the ground And won't come down We won't come down Yeah, here's to all To all this culture's rules and your pretty things How dirty, wild, blurry, juvenile We ain't got no time for what tomorrow brings And the choir singsLet's take our time While it's still ours to take'Cause some things hardly change But nothing ever stays the same Let's fall back in love With the world and who we are And do the things we talked about But never did before And darling Don't blink because you will And when you open up your eyes again You may not recognise a friend It may be bittersweet'Cause we're no longer Seventeen, but we're still young So dance with me in naivety And follow endlessly The sound of reverie Make up our minds While they're still ours to make The past is in the rear view And the future holds no weight We've got a lot But what have we got to lose Besides the track of time And all the ugly shades of blueThe only thing I'm really sure of I'm unsure of most everything But I'm looking up and looking forward There's nothing back there for you or me So you say you are Broken, beaten Used and mistreated Tired, shattered Bruised and battered The only thing I'm really sure of I'm unsure of almost everything But I know, I know I only wanna talk to you I only wanna talk to you I only wanna talk to you I only wanna talk to you I only wanna talk to you, now I only wanna talk to To you You see, yesterday I said tomorrow I learned today tomorrow can't be saved And the less you know the moreI'm not looking for anything In particular But I'm far more desperate than you think I wonder what it's like to be the universe Experiencing itself ironically I need some space to run around I'll always have the underground I'll build my road despite the cost I'm not looking to be found No, no not at all Unaware of where I'm going Or if I'm going anywhere at all But I know I'll take the leap If it is worth the fall So long as the blood keeps flowing I'll set a sail and swim across I'm not looking to be found Just want to feel unlost With my eyes closed this feels like home Adrift in my own head And all I really know is Whatever this is it doesn't get easier So take it slow Just take it slowWhen I see your face It’s like I hit rewind Because you’re on repeat Just like “so good” in “Sweet Caroline”I want to put you on Like a 45 And I’ll watch you spin Until the sunrise With the windows closed I hear your heartbeat echo I feel the same rush all over For the first time all over again And I swear These days You’ve been stuck in my brain Want to play you Over and over again Sticky just like the song in my head Back to that summer soundtrack Want to play you Over and over again Sticky just like the song in my head To be honest I am full of shit But that's alright Because everyone else that I know is It's just a tough thing For us humans to admit Yes, we all have the question But we don't know what the answer is Oh, the brain is a funny place Oblivion is where I'm headed My mind is on the brink of going supernova Just shut up, that's when she said it She told me just shut up and drink your diet soda The bloody unknown My every fear in essence This neurotic head makes me believe Danger is omnipresent And all the crazies talk about The world and how it's gonna end I sit worried sick Because I'm starting to believe them And I've got an ugly little feeling Oh, the brain is a funny place
