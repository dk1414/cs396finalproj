We had a great day Even though we forgot to eat And you had a bad dream And we got no sleep'Cause we were kissing I had a fever Until I met you Now you make me cool But sometimes I still do Something embarrassing I never said I'd be all right Just thought I could hold myself together When I couldn't breathe, I went outside Don't know why I thought it'd be any better I'm fine now, it doesn't matter I didn't wanna be this guy I cried at your show with the teenagers Tell your friend I'll be all right In the morning it won't matterShe's asleep in the back seat Looking peaceful enough to me But she's wakin' up inside a dream Full of screeching tires and fire We're comin' back from where no one lives Pretty much just veterans When I pointed out where the North Star is She called me a fuckin' liar Emily, I'm sorry, I just Make it up as I go along And I can feel myself becoming Someone only you could want Headed straight for the concrete In a nightmare, screaming Now I'm wide awake, spiraling And you don't wanna talk Just take me back to Montreal I'll get a real job, you'll go back to school We can burn out in the freezing cold And just get lostI said, "I think that you're special"You told me once that I'm selfish And I kissed you hard In the dark, in the closet You said my music is mellow Maybe I'm just exhausted You think you're a good person Because you won't punch me in the stomach And I love you I don't know why I just do, ooh, but You're not special, you're evil You don't get to tell me to calm down You made me feel like an equal But I'm better than you And you should know that by now When you fell down the stairs It looked like it hurt and I wasn't sorry I shoulda left you right there With your hostages, my heart and my car keys You don't know meDreamcatcher on the rearview mirror Hasn't caught a thing yet Twenty dollars and a souvenir Anything's worth trying To stay out of your nightmares See, I was in your dream last night Always end up dying You said, because of course I did Ooh Ooh Always managed to move in Right next to cemeteries And never far from a hospital I don't know what that tells you about me Pulling thorns out of my palm Work a midnight surgery When you cut a hole into my skull Do you hate what you see like I do Black hole opened in the kitchen Every clock's a different time It would only take the energy to fix it I don't know why I am The way I am Not strong enough to be your man I tried, I can't Stop staring at the ceiling fan and Spinning out about things that haven't happened Breathing in and out Drag racing through the canyon Singing "Boys Don't Cry"Do you see us getting scraped up off the pavement I don't know why I am The way I am Not strong enough to be your man I lied, I am Just lowering your expectations Half a mind that keeps the other second guessing Close my eyеs and countMet you at the dive bar to go shoot some pool And make fun of the cowboys with the neck tattoos Ask you easy questions about work and school I'm trying to be cool about it Feelin' like an absolute fool about it Wishin' you were kind enough to be cruel about it Tellin' myself I can always do without it Knowing that it probably isn't true I came prepared for absolution, if you'd only ask So I take some offense when you say, "No regrets"I remember it's impossible to pass your test But I'm trying to forget about it Feelin' like I'm breaking a sweat about it Wishin' you would kindly get out of my head about it Tеllin' myself one day, I'll forget about it Knowing that it probably isn't truе Once, I took your medication to know what it's like And now I have to act like I can't read your mind I ask you how you're doing and I let you lieYou said you wanted to feel alive So we went to the beach You were born in July '95 In a deadly heat You say you're a winter bitch But summer's in your blood You can't help but become the sun When you moved to Chicago You were spinnin' out When you don't know who you are You fuck around and find out When you called me from the train Water freezin' in your eyes You were happy and I wasn't surprised And it feels good to be known so well I can't hide from you like I hide from myself Now you're movin' in Breakin' a sweat on your upper lip And gettin' pissed about humidity And the leaky faucet You already hurt my feelings three times In the way only you couldIt's a bad idea and I'm all about it Give it one more chance and Then I finally had it When you wake up, I'll be gone again Motorcycle in the front lawn It's an all-night drive from your house to Reno To the T-bird graveyard where we play with fire In another life, we were arsonists How long's the Chevy been on cinder blocks Mama told me that it don't run on wishes But that I should have fun Pushing the flowers that come up Into the front of a shotgun So many hills to die on Run out of gas, out of time, out of money You're doing what you can, just makin' it run Gas, out of time, out of money You're doing what you can, just makin' it run Gas, out of time, out of money You're doing what you can, just makin' it run Gas, out of time, out of money You're doing what you can, just makin' it run Gas, out of time, out of money You're doing what you can, just makin' it runI can't hear you, you're too far away I can't see you, the light is in my face I can't touch you, I wouldn't if I could I can't love you how you want me to I can't love you how you want me to I can't love you how you want me to Here's the best part, distilled for you But you want what I can't give to you Your hands are grabbing while my hands are tied I can't love you how you want me to I can't love you how you want me to I can't love you how you want me to Who do you think you are Who do you think I am What do you want to say What do you think will change Maybe I'm afraid of you Maybe I'm afraid of youYou put salt in the wound And a kiss on my cheek You butter me up And you sit down to eat You add insult to injury You say you believe in me But you haven't decided About taking or leaving me But you take and you take Like silks up my sleeve Tied corner to corner, never ending Trick after trick, I make the magic And you unrelentingly ask for the secret Neck full of mockingbirds All calling your name I tried to sing it all back Like I heard it, it don't sound the same I'm gnashing my teeth Like a child of Cain If this is a prison, I'm willing to burn my own chain
