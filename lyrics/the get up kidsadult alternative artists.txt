Come tomorrow, I'll be on my way back home In the morning, call from a roadside telephone One night doesn't mean the rest of my life If I go, it's not impossible But possible is probably wrong So let go, 'cause I'm afraid to try Keep my hands by my side I won't come back I hope some day, you understand I want to try, and make it right But don't know if I can Last night, everything was right, the rain was gone One summer night's the only time we've known So shut your eyes When you wake up, I'll be gone When you wake up, I'll be gone One night doesn't mean the rest of my life If I go, it's not impossible But possible is probably wrong So let go, 'cause I'm afraid to dieCan you sleep as the sound hits your ears One at a time An unspoken balance here Unabridged for so many years That I should stare at receivers To receive her Isn't fair Don't worry, I'll catch you Don't worry, I'll catch you Don't ever worry Your arms in mine, any time Wouldn't trade anything You're still my everything To my surprise Before my eyes, you arrive Don't worry, I'll catch you Don't worry, I'll catch you Don't ever worryWhat became of everyone I used to know Where did our respectable convictions go Your words don't match the story that your actions show What do I know I'm sure you can't help but remembering I thought that you'd be the one not to forget Remembering's not helping you yet Say goodnight, mean goodbye I know you think my life would stop when you're away Maybe I can see you on holidays You're worlds away I've never forgotten all our yesterdays I'm lucky if we're speaking on the holidays The evidence presents itself accusingly Your absence speaking everything you think of me Now that I am faced with opportunity You're not remembering I'm not asking you anyway And even if you ever could cave in I wouldn't know where to beginIt's words you forget to Anniversary songs The bottles bite back Your tolerance wrong Your good intentions count for little anymore If you're sorry, why wage war I'm not fully convinced There's something wrong with this Could another point of view Biased and untrue Tear me away from you Will you be my valentine If I'm a world away Apologies are breaking me Constants aren't so constant anymore Two days, I wait for calls to come through Tonight for me translates to yesterday to you Bend and you wave You're barely away I wish I could say tonight When you bend and wave goodbye You'd take me with youYou really think that you're bigger than this To the tune of ten thousand lisps Who'd have thought we'd represent When I can't take a compliment Overexposure is the key And any focus on me Is appreciated And it should be No wonder now I finally found The right formula for...You taught me how I play the fool Every mistake that I make I couldn't have made without you What's said is done And plain to see You take it all too seriously What better way to make an honest mistake Than a televised hand of fate When the world closes in on you A decision would be overdue Now, nothing left is out of hand A stronger, jaded man stands If the world is ending Then we toast to itYou've got some nerve, I never knew What with the world we gave away in front of you I see it all much clearer now You're just a phase I've gotten over anyhow It's over I'm not giving in again We're loyal like brothers Just us versus all the others You're the one for...You're the one for me I trusted misleading promises worth repeating How could you do this to me Red letter day that I learned I'm sure you'll get what you deserve I see it all much clearer since Far past the point of this It's over We're loyal like brothers Just us versus all the others You're the one for...You're the one for meTen minutes to downtown Is ten minutes too far When my friends all say I'm crazy Maybe I'm being selfish Maybe I'm just scared Don't be gone when I get home I need you there If I had to explain it I wouldn't know where to start It's like you're falling in love while I just fall apart Ten minutes to downtown Is ten minutes too far When my heart is saying, "You're crazy."Maybe things are getting better Maybe things aren't so bad Don't be gone when I get home You're all I haveLong way from home Lost by an echo I'd never have known I've got pictures to prove I was there But you don't care Here's me overseas Across the pond by the Dover peaks I've smuggled myself into new nationalities You think you'd be proud of me There's room to believe Out of sight Out of mind Out of reach Start over Is no way to begin Long way from home Lost by an echo I'd never have known I've got pictures to prove I was there But you don't careForgive me for running off to find the one thing I have to do And each night, you can fall asleep assured That someday, I'll be coming home to you These constant reminders in everything I see The chance of a lifetime, what a great place to be Oh Amy, don't hate me for running away from you Oh Amy, don't hate me'Cause I'm still in love with you I'm sorry I can't be everything to you Your face is at the heart of what I do Everything's for you Oh Amy, don't hate me for running away from you Oh Amy, don't hate me'Cause I'm still in love with you Oh Amy, oh Amy!Oh Amy, oh Amy!Oh Amy, don't hate me'Cause I'm still in love with youEvery attempt to Is filled with holes Reads like a polygraph, I'm told I'm not bitter, anyway Let it go I never sleep still Lest I forget Tied down by handicaps instead I'm not bitter, anyway But I didn't want it to turn out this way Sing a long goodnight Forfeit any fight Refuse to rest assured It comes with no reply Hold on too tight Hang on every word If it all ended tonight You know that I wouldn't mind Back to the good old times Before it won
