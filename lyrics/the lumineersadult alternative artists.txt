Ah, ah, when I was younger I, I should've known better And I can't feel no remorse And you don't feel nothing back I, I got a new girlfriend here Feels like he's on top And I don't feel no remorse And you can't see past my blindness Oh, Ophelia You've been on my mind, girl, since the flood Oh, Ophelia Heaven help the fool who falls in love I, I got a little paycheck You got big plans and you gotta move And I don't feel nothing at all And you can't feel nothing small“Honey, I love you”That's all she wroteI was Cleopatra, I was young and an actress When you knelt by my mattress, and asked for my hand But I was sad you asked it, as I laid in a black dress With my father in a casket, I had no plans And I left the footprints, the mud stained on the carpet And it hardened like my heart did when you left town But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant Damn your wife, I'd be your mistress just to have you around But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time While the church discouraged, any lust that burned within me Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held true So I drive a taxi, and the traffic distracts me From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce But I've read this script and the costume fits, so I'll play my partHo!Hey!Ho!Hey!Ho!I been tryin' to do it right I been livin' a lonely life I been sleepin' here instead I been sleepin' in my bed Sleepin' in my bed So show me family All the blood that I will bleed I don't know where I belong I don't know where I went wrong But I can write a song And I belong with you, you belong with me You're my sweetheart I belong with you, you belong with me You're my sweet…Ho!Hey  Ho!Hey, hey!Ho!I don't think you're right for him Think of what it might have been if we Took a bus to Chinatown I'd be standin' on Canal And Bowery And she'd be standin' next to me I belong with you, you belong with me You're my sweetheart I belong with you, you belong with me You're my sweetheart Love, we need it now Let's hope for some'Cause oh, we're bleedin' outPack yourself a toothbrush, dear Pack yourself a favorite blouse Take a withdrawal slip, take all of your savings out'Cause if we don't leave this town We might never make it out I was not born to drown, baby come on Forget what Father Brennan said We were not born in sin Leave a note on your bed Let your mother know you're safe And by the time she wakes We'll have driven through the state We'll have driven through the night Baby, come on If the Sun don't shine on me today And if the subways flood and bridges break Will you lay yourself down and dig your grave Or will you rail against your dying day And when we looked outside, couldn't even see the sky How do you pay the rent, is it your parents Or is it hard work dear Holding the atmosphere I don't wanna live like thatShe'll lie and steal and cheat And beg you from her knees Make you think she means it this time She'll tear a hole in you The one you can't repair But I still love her, I don't really care When we were young, oh-oh, we did enough When it got cold, ooh-ooh, we bundled up I can't be told, ah-ah, it can't be done It's better to feel pain Than nothing at all The opposite of love is indifference So pay attention now I'm standing on your porch screamin' out And I won't leave until you come downstairs So keep your head up, keep your love Keep your head up, my love Keep your head up, my love Keep your head up, keep your loveWhen you left this town, with your windows down And the wilderness inside Let the exits pass, all the tar and glass'Til the road and sky align The strangers in this town They raise you up just to cut you down Oh, Angela, it's a long time coming And your Volvo lights lit up green and white With the cities on the signs But you held your course to some distant war In the corners of your mind From the second time around The only love I ever found Oh Angela it's a long time coming Home at last Were you safe and warm in your coat of arms With your fingers in a fist Did you hear the notes, all those static codes In the radio abyss I feel her filth in my bones Wash off my hands 'til it's gone The walls, they're closin' in With velvet curtains Some love was made for the lights Some kiss your cheek and goodnight Lift up a red high heel Lock up your doors with steel They're makin' noise in my street My blinds are drawn, I can't see Smashed in my car window Didn't touch the stereo Slow it down, Angie come back to bed Rest your arms, and rest your legs Act like you've been here before Smile less and dress up some more Tie up your scarf real tight These boys are out for blood tonightIt's not the words you say, but how you say it I saved a picture where your hair was braided They found your wallet in the cemetery You told your daughter she was ordinary You hate the name Junior Your husband loved his computers Your mother never was one The eldest of seven children If you don’t have it, then you'll never give it And I don't blame you for the way you livin’A little boy was born in February You couldn't sober up to hold a baby You hate the name Donna You love to judge strangers' karma We drove from New Jersey The trucks always made you worryOne, two, three, four Could it be I was the one That you held so deep in the night On the back staircase You fell to your knees with tears in your eyes All that you suffered, all the disease You couldn't hide it, hide it from me All alone, scared in your room Would you swear there's nobody home On the bed, laying awake As you prayed he'd leave you alone I'll let the darkness swallow me whole I need to find you, need you to know I'll be your friend in the daylight again There we will be, like an old enemy Like the salt and the seaOh, the devil's inside You opened the door, you gave him a ride Too young to know, too old to admit That you couldn't see how it ends What did you do to my eyes What did you sing to that lonely child Promised it all, but you lied You better slow down, baby, soon It's all or nothing to you The glow of Hollywood signs They sold you a bridge They fed you the lines You always confused your servants for friends But you couldn't see how it ends It's all or nothing to you What did you do to my eyes What did you say to my only child Promised your love, but you lied You better slow down, baby, soon It's all or nothing to you
