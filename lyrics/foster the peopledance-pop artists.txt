kitchen and it's packed in ice I've waited for a long time Yeah, the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger I reason with my cigarette And say, "Your hair's on fire, you must've lost your wits," yeahYeah, it's over, it's over, I'm circling these vultures Got me praying, man, this hunger, and feeling something rotten Last time I saw you, said "What's up " and pushed right through Then I tried to catch you but we're always on the move And now it's over, we're sober, symptoms of the culture And the night ain't getting younger, last call's around the corner Feeling kinda tempted and I'm pouring out the truth Just fading out these talkers 'cause now all I want is you Just sayin'Come over here and sit next to me We can see where things go naturally Just say the word and I'll part the sea Just come over here and sit next to me, ooh-ooh-ooh And I'll take you high High, ooh-ooh-ooh Well, I ain't frontin' my intention, got your man outlined in chalk It's a midnight intervention, got no plans to make it stop Last time I saw you, said you wanna keep it light But I'm here to tell you I'm not trying to change your mind It's alright, ooh-ooh-ooh It's alright, ooh-ooh-oohRise above, gonna start the war Oh, what you want  What you need  What'd you come here for Well, an eye for an eye and an 'F' for fight They're taking me down as the prisoners riot Eh, yeah Got shackles on, my words are tied Fear can make you compromise With the lights turned up, it's hard to hide Sometimes I want to disappear Eh, oh, eh When I feel kinda bad and don't want to stress I just pass it off on ability Well, you got what you want and what you never knew Perfect gift from me to you Yeah, yeah, yeahI wouldn't try to throw myself away If you asked me, I'd say To be careful, my love At death we'll leave the same If you want me to stay Don't keep me waiting for it We can't change the things we can't control It's summer somewhere so you shouldn't be so cold But you can't even look me in the eye if you tried We can try, we can try I see us dancing by ourselves We do it better with no one around, yeah Just you in my imagination, yeah In my imagination, oh Yeah, there's nothing left to cry about I guess I'm living in a drought It's raining like it was before Something that you never knew you needed more ofSometimes life, it takes you by the hair Pulls you down before you know it It's gone and you're dead again I've been in places and I won't pretend That I'd make it out just to fall on my head Wake up strange and take the walk downstairs Hit the pawn up on the corner and pay for my rent You know that I could not believe my own truth Just show 'em what I choose, got nothing to lose, oh Yeah, yeah, and it's okay I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright I took a sip of something poison, but I'll hold on tight You know those days when you wanna just choose To not get out of bed, you're lost in your head again You play the game, but you kind of cut'Cause you're coming down hard, your joints are all stuck I've tried to say that it's not the only way I never knew if I could face myself to change You were pacing, I was insecure Slip and fall, I'm dodging calls, hug the prison I've been living inYou do everything you can 'cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down Yeah, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start Feelings sleeping in the field again But I can feel, I can feel, I can feel it's beginning to end Yeah, premonitions smiling in the dark Well, I can see, I can see, I can see the story's starting to arc It dries up I've been a spoken word, I've been a riverbed I've been a rabid force and let it flow out from within Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white And color's so, oh You do everything you can 'cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down You say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the startNever want to stand upon myself Never want to get in the way, I said it I don't know what the plan is, but you can share with me'Cause I'll be a listening ear To everything you say, I won't turn away And I'll listen, open up my heart and I must say that I love you, so Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love And it's better this time than ever before Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love And it's better this time than I've ever known Every day is a battle I face Strange life I live, but it's what you've decided I give it all into your hands Do what you will with me And I'll, I'll smile when you speak Remember all those times I was hoping for something And shaking my head from all I had done But you never left me Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love And it's better this time than ever before Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love And it's better this time than I've ever known Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love And it's better this time than ever before Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love And it's better this time than I've ever knownWhat you need  What you need What you need, man  What you need What you need  Yeah, what'd you see What'd you see  Yeah, oh yeah Well, I need a little something to cool my head off Need a little something to cool my head off, yeah Need a little something because I've been running from a truce We'll never lose Lies come from loose teeth tied to the noose Climbing up my own tree hoping it can hold All the things I've seen but have chosen to ignore, mmm Well, I said, well, I believe I've been well fed, yeah But the wolf's not dead Say what you love, it's alright Don't be afraid to find your light Embrace the day like night We're here to fight, we all go wild again And you have the name of someone I love You said, just keep it true, lift up your name Seasons change, you know it'll never be the same We'll see the sun again And before it fades I just wanna say that I love you, mmmCall it what you want, eh, eh, eh Call it what you want, eh, eh, eh I said, just call it what you want, eh, eh, eh Call it what you want Yeah, we're locked up in ideas We like to label everything Well, I'm just gonna do here what I gotta do here'Cause I gotta keep myself free You're ducking and moving just to hide your bruises From all your enemies And I'm in the crossfire dodging bullets From your expectancies, yeah, yeah Ooh, we got nothing to lose You better run and hide, yeah, you crossed the line I got a knife behind my back, just sayin'Ooh, we got nothing to prove Your social guides give you swollen eyes But what I got can't be bought, so you can just Call it what you want, eh, eh, eh Call it what you want, eh, eh, eh I said, just call it what you want, eh, eh, eh Call it what you wantYou are a secret that's worth keeping And now I'm keeping my mouth shut On the weekends I won't hang out with anybody else The pavement, always begging What's it want from me And I keep falling backwards, looking for relief Oh, to be free Well, I've been counting all the minutes And the days have been counting me I want to live my life again But you are I'll never understand the winds But you do I didn't know I was afraid But you did I want to do it again Well, I've been sleeping Waiting for something But to feel nothing At all, and avoid the call Sometimes I'm reckless Sometimes misdirected And sometimes when I'm tested I tend to do nothing at all
