Sunny came home to her favorite room Sunny sat down in the kitchen She opened a book and a box of tools Sunny came home with a mission She says, "Days go by, I'm hypnotized I'm walking on a wire I close my eyes and fly out of my mind Into the fire"Sunny came home with a list of names She didn't believe in transcendence"And it's time for a few small repairs," she said Sunny came home with a vengeance She says, "Days go by, I don't know why I'm walking on a wire I close my eyes and fly out of my mind Into the fire"Get the kids and bring a sweater Dry is good and wind is better Count the years, you always knew it Strike a match, go on and do itWhen you know That you know Who you love You can't deny it Or go back Or give up Or pretend That you don't buy it When it's clear this time You've found the one You never let him go'Cause you know And you know That you know When you feel In your skin In your bones And the hollows Of your heart There's no way You can wait'Til tomorrowToday, we took a walk up the street We picked a flower and climbed the hill above the lake And secret thoughts were said aloud We watched the faces in the clouds Until the clouds had blown away And were we ever somewhere else You know, it's hard to say And I never saw blue like that before Across the sky, around the world You're giving me all you have and more And no one else has ever shown me how To see the world the way I see it now Oh I, I never saw blue like that I can't believe a month ago I was alone, I didn't know you I hadn't seen you or heard your name And even now, I'm so amazed It's like a dream, it's like a rainbow, it's like the rain And some things are the way they are And words just can't explainChina gets broken And it will never be the same Boats on the ocean Find their way back again I am weaving Like a drunkard Like a balloon up in the air I am needing a puncture and someone To point me somewhere I'm gonna keep my head on straight I just hope it's not too late Open up the gate I go straight on I'll steady on Go steady on Steady on Steady on I was feeling imploded A wooden smile, a wooden heart Then things exploded Like rockets in the dark Now I'm pulling out splinters And I'm off to hibernate somewhere For the nuclear winter Of another love affairAll the happy couples on their way to New Orleans Reminding me of when we got along They're only renting time and space to fill up with their dreams And dreams are what they'll have when they have gone How could it be that I was born without a clue to carry on And still it is the same now I am older Armed with just a will and then this love for singing songs And minding less and less if I am colder But I have this funny ache and it's burning in my chest And it spreads just like a fire inside my body Is it something God left out in my spirit or my flesh Would I be saved if I were brave and had a baby It was never clear what would come next but that's the risk and that's the test And you were the only one so far to follow And no one talks about when one might stop and need to rest Or how long you sit alone before you stop looking back It's like you're waiting for Godot And then you pick your sorry ass up off the street and GoAs a little girl I came down to the water With a little stone in my hand It would shimmer and sing And we knew everything As a little girl I came down But in a little while I got steeped in authority Heaven only knows what went wrong There is nothing so cruel Than to bury that jewel When it was mine all along I'm gonna find it'Cause you're shining—I can see you You're smiling—that's enough Oh, I'm holding on to you Like a diamond in the rough Every now and then I can see that I am getting somewhere Where I have to go is so deep I was angry back then And you know I still am Well, I have lost too much sleep I'm gonna find itI'm riding shotgun down the avalanche Uh huh Tumbling and falling down the avalanche Uh huh So be quiet tonight, the stars shine bright On this mountain of new fallen snow But I will raise up my voice into the void You have left me nowhere to go And I love you so much and it's so bizarre A mystery that goes on and on and on And this is the best thing and the very most hard Oh, we don't get along After countless appeals we keep spinning our wheels On this mountain of new fallen snow So I let go the catch and we are over the edge You have left me nowhere to go I'm riding shotgun down the avalancheDown at the train they go to Independence every day But anywhere else now seems like a million miles away And I must have been high to believe That I would ever leave Now I'm just a flat fine line Like the Wichita skyline I rode on the airstream across the great lonesome afternoon And I wished hard enough to hurt, drove fast enough to catch the moon But I must have been dreamin' again'Cause there's nothing around the bend Except for that flat fine line The Wichita skyline Well, as far as Salina I can get that good station from La Rue I'm searching the dial while I'm scanning the sky for a patch of blue And I watch the black clouds roll in Chasing me back again Back to that flat fine line The Wichita skyline The Wichita skyline The Wichita skylineGo jump in the lake, go ride up the hill Get out of this house It's a house of your making, it's a house of ill will Get out of this house Go listen to Buddha, go listen to Joe Get out of this house If anyone asks, you tell them you don't know Get out of this house I spent 11 long years in a hothouse zone I spent 29 more trying to get home Well, I never got home, but I did what I did And I got myself this house, and you can't come in, oh Yeah Get out of this house Get out of this house I'm the queen of my castle, I'm the king of my room Get out, get out of this house I got more than I need, more than I ever could use Get out, get out of this houseFill me up, fill me up I'm a long way from home And I don't have a lot to say Fill me up, fill me up'Cause you're all that I've got And I traveled a long, long way Cheer me up, cheer me up'Cause I'm all alone And I'm takin' it day by day Cheer me up, cheer me up'Cause you're all that I've got And I traveled a long, long way I'm a bellhop now On a busy day And I'm starting at sunrise And the color of dawn From this plane that I'm on Is the day breaking in your eyes I'm a still life now On a tabletop I'm a case study in French blue And it's clear to me now That the whole of my life I've been making my way to you
