So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot away from you And if you leave here, you leave me broken, shattered I lie I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot, then we can die Oh, oh, oh I know I won't be leaving here with you I say, don't you know You say you don't know I say: take me out I say you don't show Don't move, time is slow I say: take me out Well, I say you don't know You say you don't know I say: take me out If I move, this could die If eyes move, this could die I want you to take me outWhen you're half way from a dream Is it hard to work out what is real Is the real over there More vivid than here ever feels We could love, we could love you If you need somebody to love you While you're looking for somebody to love Sweet love illumination Sweet, sweet love elevation Outside, fresh avaricide But inside our love, you'll be alright Sweet love illumination Sweet, sweet love celebration Cop car burn, reason turn But it'll bring you up, you'll be alright You'll be alright Is the Blackpool bright light Brighter than the light in your home Were you born to be loved But nobody else seems to know We could love, we could love you If you need somebody to love you While you're looking for somebody to loveTake your white finger Slide the nail under the top and bottom buttons of my blazer Relax the fraying wool, slacken ties And I'm not to look at you in the shoe But the eyes find the eyes Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files You must follow, leave this academic factory You will find me in the matinée, the dark of the matinée It's better in the matinée, the dark of the matinée is mine Yes, it's mine Time every journey to bump into you accidentally I charm you and tell you of the boys I hate, all the girls I hate All the words I hate, all the clothes I hate How I'll never be anything I hate You smile, mention something that you like Oh, how you'd have a happy life if you did the things you like Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files You must follow, leave this academic factory You will find me in the matinée, the dark of the matinée It's better in the matinée, the dark of the matinée is mine Yes, it's mineDon’t be concerned It’s just the way that gravity works 'round here All slowly rising, falling patiently Feel no, feel no fear Cirrus caress you, cumulus kiss you Raindrops of crystal whisper, "We’ll miss you"But go Let go Always and always and always ascending The opening line leaves an uncertain ending Always and always and always ascending
