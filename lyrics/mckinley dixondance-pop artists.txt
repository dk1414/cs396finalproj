don’t know how to cope Every time I’m awoke I have fantasies of a rope Leaving me strangled and choked, got me gasping for hope Now I’m back copping some more'Cause it keeps me away from the metal Daily, a dance with the devil Anxieties, trying me Wire me, into a pedal Pressing me, wish it would let go In search of a level of peace That I’d never reach Convinced I won’t get there 'til I’m deceased Weaving my grief up inside instrumentals In case you were wondering dawg I been nowhere, just floating through time Taking L’s for my friends Look my homie in the eyes, "Dawg, I love you I promise you’ll never go homeless again"That's my word, that's on God And if God get in the way I'ma have to put God to an end Give a fuck what you say Too many times I done prayed With no answer Ends up as a trend Riding so lowFuck around they take your son My niggas had the right to run We twist our fingers into guns They get torn apart by the sun You can’t thrive when you only that nigga'Cause the prior nigga ain’t make it out his last battle alive Where my grandma resides Same thing for the homies If I speak her name, will it keep her alive I’m so selfish Both headphones in, don’t wanna hear cars comin'There’s certain sounds when you get close to death And I swear, it sound like when she start humming Baby, I can’t givе you wings But this chain on my neck is my power of flight So you know what it brings You can hear it sing, listеn to it Orchestrate the way that we live Maneuver through the pain that they give You stronger than what they say you is Little man, this chain will make you big It’ll change your life for better or worse Make something of you 'fore you get in the hearse But then you my rival, so I know this hurts Pray that chain is a fraction of your worthTread softly, please tread so softly These demons haunt me, Mama keep them off me She says, "Everything gon' be okay"Whispers to me, "I know that it hurts Sometimes cuts could use more dirt"The songs they sing in the jump ropes They have heart Tread softly, please tread so softly These demons haunt me, Mama keep them off me She says, "Everything gon' be okay"Whispers to me, "I know that it hurts Sometimеs cuts could use more dirt"The songs thеy sing in the jump ropes They have heart, have heart The song that I bear And I bear it because my mama The one who taught it And still for her, I work for honor I walked along the water Revealed the holes in my skin Just so these motherfuckers know who I am And I’m a motherfucking human, rapping lucid on the harp I'm prolly down to die for my art I definitely don’t know what I’m doing And I’m moving through the bullshit by my prayers and angels Close to familiar But at best I’m a stranger But a seat at the table Eat without saying grace That’s prolly why I’m not graceful And end up falling on face Trippin', and niggas trippin’Niggas wish upon a nigga Live vicariously even if it kill em Nigga tread soft, my heart so light Will it really be okay when it’s dark at night We don’t know the know And really grow so much Dreaming bout being already there When you so close to touch, yo, nigga, tread soft Nigga tread soft Nigga tread, tread soft
