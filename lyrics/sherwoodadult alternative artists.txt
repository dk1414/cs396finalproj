A warning carved in a figure Run before they see you Lead you all away Run before they know Can't be real Make me feel Like crumbling away Where are all the names A warning wind in the distance brings a colder morning Mourning day and night brings a darker light Over me Now there are nine De profundis clamavi Bleeding from the darkest beating heart What is this I'm looking for Who am I beyond this door Show me something that I recognize Show me answers to all this mystery A warring cry of resistance sings to sleep a monster Howling with the loons and tolls an April bell In my mind Won't stop ringing Time is rust wearing away Greater than all grains of sand you seeFalling slowly, drifting coldly When will the night end So little time's gone by Lightly drifting down below Snowing and foaming falls Falling in form into the midnight deep horizon Beyond the shore where we all go Shaking, all that's gone involuntarily awry Intensity of pain incensed in me A cold flame, a fire, my one way out Waking inside of a dreamscape That shows me the end of my life A flash before my eyes restore The more painful way that we go And I drift down a little farther down Into the great unknown And holding back from breathing in From letting go and giving in, I'm Drowning in silence, breathing in violence Dying alone, I know you never knew me I'm sinking all the way down In darker, deeper, colder water Drowning and silent, bleeding in violet Dying alone can't even kill this feeling I'm going all the way under I'm darker, deeper down and drowningWhere are we going from here Where do we go Are we all blinded by fear Where do we go  How do we know Need for survival is clear We persevere without an end Into forever, we fall And wander on and on and on Dust of a thousand years thrown on your path And in the aftermath, you'll stumble forward Mouth full of air resuscitating life And you'll ascend and carry on and on Where are we going from here Where do we go Are we all blinded by fear How do we know  How do we know In the depths, easy steps Water flows Fire burns, all returns Ashes cleanse the ordinary woeI just went crazy on designer for my bae Luxury up in the driveway V VS's

dreamland is so far away from you after all Distance takes time, time takes us all away I'll always follow you and be your shadow Shadowing everything that your Ever-glowing knowing brings to light I'm floating up into the bright air, light sanctified They'll hear my name, just like a shock wave, mind rarified Shock wave Nine deicidal apparitions Time is the poison of attrition When will the day come when a new way dawns The new day's gone and the Night might bring the darkest dawn to light Our wayA warning carved in a figure Run before they see you Lead you all away Run before they know
