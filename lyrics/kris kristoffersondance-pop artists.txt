Busted flat in Baton Rouge, headin' for the trains Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained Took us all the way to New Orleans I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues With them windshield wipers slappin' time and Bobby clappin' hands we finally sang up every song That driver knew Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues And buddy, that was good enough for me Good enough for me and my Bobby Mc Gee.From the coalmines of Kentucky to the California sun Bobby shared the secrets of my soul Standin' right beside me, Lord, through everythin' I done Every night she kept me from the coldWhy me Lord What have I ever done To deserve even one Of the pleasures I've known Tell me, Lord What did I ever do That was worth lovin' you Or the kindness you've shown Lord help me, Jesus I've wasted it so help me, Jesus I know what I am But now that I know That I've needed you so help me, Jesus My soul's in your hand Try me, Lord If you think there's a way I can try to repay All I've taken from you Maybe, Lord I can show someone else What I've been through myself On my way back to youI started writing a song about Chris Gentry and ended up writing about Dennis Hopper,  Johnny Cash..  Norman, Norbert, Funky Donnie Fritts, Billy Swan, Bobby Neuwirth, Jerry Jeff Walker,  Paul Siebel…and Ramblin’ Jack Elliott had a lot to do with it See him wasted on the sidewalk in his jacket and his jeans Wearin' yesterday's misfortunes like a smile Once he had a future full of money, love, and dreams Which he spent like they was goin' outta style And he keeps right on a-changin' for the better or the worse Searchin' for a shrine, he's never found Never knowin' if believin' is a blessin' or a curse Or if the goin' up was worth the comin' down He's a poet and he's a picker, he's a prophet and he's a pusher He's a pilgrim and a preacher and a problem when he's stoned He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction Takin' every wrong direction on his lonely way back home He has tasted good and evil in your bedrooms and your bars And he's traded in tomorrow for today Runnin' from his devils, Lord, and reachin' for the stars And losin' all he's loved along the way But if this world keeps right on turnin' for the better or the worse And all he ever gets is older and around From the rockin' of the cradle to the rollin' of the hearse The goin' up was worth the comin' downWell, I woke up Sunday morning With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad So I had one more for dessert Then I fumbled through my closet for my clothes And found my cleanest dirty shirt And I shaved my face and combed my hair And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day I'd smoked my brain the night before On cigarettes and songs that I'd been pickin'But I lit my first and watched a small kid Cussin' at  a can that he was kickin'Then I crossed the empty street And caught the Sunday smell of someone fryin' chicken And it took me back to somethin'That I'd lost somehow, somewhere along the way On the Sunday morning sidewalks Wishing, Lord, that I was stoned Cause there's something in a Sunday That makes a body feel alone And there's nothin' short of dyin'Half as lonesome as the sound On the sleepin' city sidewalks Sunday mornin' comin' downTake the ribbon from your hair Shake it loose and let it fall Lay it soft upon my skin Like the shadows on the wall Come and lay down by my side Till the early morning light All I'm takin' is your time Help me make it through the night I don't care who’s right or wrong I don't try to understand Let the devil take tomorrow Lord, tonight I need a friend Yesterday is dead and gone And tomorrow's out of sight And it's sad to be alone Help me make it through the night I don't care what's right or wrong I don't try to understand Let the devil take tomorrow Lord, tonight I need a friend Yesterday is dead and gone And tomorrow's out of sight Lord, it's bad to be alone Help me make it through the night{Intro}Don't look so sad, I know it's over But life goes on, and this old world will keep on turning Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning Lay your head upon my pillow Hold your warm and tender body close to mine Hear the whisper of the raindrops Blowin' soft against the window And make believe you love me one more time For the good times I'll get along; you'll find another And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me Lay your head upon my pillow Hold your warm and tender body close to mine Hear the whisper of the raindrops Blowin' soft against the window And make believe you love me one more time For the good timesA couple of years back I come across a great and wasted friend of mine in the hallway of a recording studio And while he was reciting some poetry to me that he'd written I saw that he was about a step away from dyin' and I couldn't help but wonder why And the lines of this song occurred to me I'm happy to say he's no longer wasted and he's got him a good woman And I'd like to dedicate this to John and June Who helped show me how to beat the devil It was winter time in Nashville, down on music city row And I was lookin' for a place to get myself out of the cold To warm the frozen feelin' that was eatin' at my soul Keep the chilly wind off my guitar My thirsty wanted whisky, my hungry needed beans But it'd been of month of paydays since I'd heard that eagle scream So with a stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreams I left my pride and stepped inside a bar Actually, I guess you'd call it a "tavern"Cigarette smoke to the ceiling and sawdust on the floor Friendly shadows I saw that there was just one old man sittin' at the bar And in the mirror I could see him checkin' me and my guitar And he turned and said "Come up here boy, and show us what you are"I said "I'm dry," and he bought me a beer He nodded at my guitar and said "It's a tough life, ain't it "I just looked at him He said, "You ain't makin' any money, are you "I said,  "You've been readin' my mail"He just smiled and said "Let me see that guitar"I've got something you oughta hear"Then he laid it on me:{Intro}I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies Turning on the world the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I've been Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying Talking of tomorrow and the money, love, and time we had to spend Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again Coming close together with a feeling that I've never known before in my time She ain't ashamed to be a woman nor afraid to be a friend I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end And loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again Mmm, mmm AhI was runnin' through the summer rain Tryin' to catch the evenin' train And kill that old familiar pain Weavin' through my tangled brain When I tipped my bottle back I smacked into a cop I didn't see That policeman said Mr  Cool If you're ain't drunk then you're a fool I said if that's against the law Tell me why I never saw A man locked in that jail of yours Who wasn't just as lowdown poor as me Well that was when someone turned out the lights And I wound up in jail to spend the night And dream of all the wine and lonely girls In this best of all possible worlds Well I woke up next morning Feelin' like my head was gone And like my thick old tongue Was lickin' somethin' sick and wrong And I told that man I'd sell my soul For somethin' wet and cold as that old cellBilly Dalton staggered on the sidewalk Someone said he stumbled and he fell Six squad cars came screaming to the rescue Hauled old Billy Dalton off to jail'Cause the law is for protection of the people Rules are rules and any fool can see We don't need no drunks like Billy Dalton Scarin' decent folks like you and me No sir-ee Homer Lee Hunnicut was nothing but a hippy Walking through this world without a care Then one day, six strapping brave policeman Held down Homer Lee and cut his hair'Cause the law is for protection of the people Rules are rules and any fool can see We don't need no hairy-headed hippies Scarin' decent folks like you and me No sir-ee
