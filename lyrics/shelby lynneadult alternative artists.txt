I don't know what it is that makes me love you so I only know I never want to let you go Cause you've started something Oh, can't you see That ever since we met You've had a hold on me It happens to be true I only want to be with you It doesn't matter where you go or what you do I want to spend each moment of the day with you Oh, look what has happened with just one kiss I never knew that I could be in love like this It's crazy but it's true I only want to be with you You stopped to smile at me And asked me if I want to dance I fell into your open arms Oh, and I didn't stand a chance Now hold on, baby I just want to be beside you everywhere As long as we're together, baby, I don't care Cause you've started something Oh, can't you see That ever since we met You've had a hold on me No matter what you do I only want to be with youIn the dark I can hear You whisper Shadows still Move across The distance What did you say It's okay Did you miss me Did you miss me Make it mine Takin' time Forgotten Speak for me Silently Surrender What did you say It's okay, oh baby Did you miss me Did you miss me You know, at times, I wondered if you ever thought of me And I wondered if you wanted to be free like me And I needed to feel you and I wondered did you miss me  baby, oh yeah"Tell Me I'm Crazy"Tell me I'm crazy Whisper everything's alright Tell me I'm crazy;Then love me like crazy tonight Am I so wrong Thinking we might be over Could it be when your holding me Your still loving her She broke your heart Is it true now she's breaking mine If you know oh please tell me so Before I go out of my mind Tell me i'm crazy Say its not true Call it my imagination Say I'm not losing you Lay down beside me Whisper everything's alright Tell me I'm crazy;Then love me like crazy tonightWell I guess this is it babe Reality has hit home hard No need in puttin' it off anymore Just turn away and let me walk Out the door You thought you had it all figured out But baby, you don't know what love's about It's time for me to spend some time alone I'm tired of trying to make This your happy home I'm leavin' This time it's for good You should have treated me The way you said you would I'm leavin' And you can't make me stay I'm tired of hurtin' you This ain't no good anyway I'm leavin'I know it's gonna be hard on ya Once it really hits you that I'm gone I spent too much time Trying to make things right When I really knew all along You'll be O.K  in time baby But it won't be today As you walk around and Try to find yourself Take a look at the bed you madeThat old picture on the dresser goes with your things The rocking chair in the corner goes with mine You can take the bed and have the T VAnd I'll keep the stereo if you don't mind We've seperated everything between us It's the kindest that we've been in a long, long time But there's still one thing we've got left between us And we don't know what to do, I wonder if we thought this through What about the love we made She's upstairs in her room, cryin' over me and you Lord we never meant to hurt her this way We've divided everything me and you Even her little heart right in two Now what about the love we made We've told her at least a thousand times we love her And no matter what happens that won't change But who could blame her if she won't believe us Aren't we the same ones who told her She'd never see this day It filled us both with shame when she told her dolly"Now promise me that you won't leave me too"And it was more than I could take when she said "Mommy If there's something I've done wrong Well, I'll be good for you"Waste away to nothin' in a dark, dusty tomb Lookin' for the traces of what used to be a room Wipe away the blood from a tormented brow Solve the wicked problem never asking how Rock the sinking vessel 'til it rests on the bottom Count the waves of water, don't remember, forgot 'em Taste the stench of livin' on thin dimes and a dream Opening an ear to a painful, silent scream Oh, life is bad Oh no, worst I ever had Ache and writhe in agony like a vise on aging bones Tar and acid drip from an ice cream cone Holding onto a wind that chases the hell Fallin' in the darkness of an inner-descending well Caress transparent night as a demon with a sword Speak with an eloquence, never saying a word Look into the clarity, then erase it with the muck Lying in a pool of consciousness, no such thing as luckWritten by Ed Bruce, Miriam Silver I can't believe your calling me Did you run out of things to do Are you bothered by my old memory Has guilt got the best of you I can't imagine what you'd want with me You must have come up short tonight But I thought you were happy being free But your voice tells me that's not right Guess things are tough all over Even on the single side of town I guess it's harder than you thought it be Without my loving arms around And now the beating of your lonely heart Is the cold nights only sound Guess things are tough all over When old memories get you down Well you ask me if I think about you What are you expecting me to say Well I do but I can live without you It's too late to ask me anyway So if you're calling me for sympathy Cause I'm getting harder to forget I won't be a one night remedy To help you live with your regretOh, I love you so much, it hurts me Darlin', that's why I'm so blue I'm so afraid to go to bed at night Afraid of losing you You know, I love so much, it hurts me And there's nothin' I can do I want to hold you, my dear, forever and ever'Cos I love you so much, it hurts me so I love you so much, it hurts me Darlin', that's why I'm so blue I'm so afraid to go to bed at night Afraid of losing you I love you so much, it hurts me And there's nothin' I can do I want to hold you, my dear, forever and ever I love you so much, oh it hurts me, it hurts me so It hurts me soWeather man says it's rainin' again Perfect night for stayin' in Well, lookin' at you I don't doubt that it's true And did I hear you say Baby put on a smile Kick your shoes off and stay a while Well since you asked me to, I don't mind if I do That ol' clock can just tick off the wall I ain't worried 'bout the time at all Long as I'm makin' time with you And holdin' you tight In the light of the radio I'll whisper, "Baby, I love you so"And since you want me too I don't mind if I do Ooh, that ol' clock can just tick off the wall I ain't worried 'bout the time at all Long as I'm makin' time with you And holdin' you tight In the light of the radio I'll whisper, "Baby, I love you so"And since you want me too I don't mind if I doMissed the Saturday dance Heard they crowded the floor I couldn't bear it without you Don't get around much anymore Thought I'd visit the club Got as far as the door They'd have asked me about you Don't get around much anymore Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease But nevertheless, why stir up memories Been invited on dates I might have gone but what for Awfully different without you Don't get around much anymore Oh, darling, I guess my mind's more at ease But nevertheless, oh, why stir up memories Been invited on dates I might have gone but what for Oh, it's awfully different without you Don't get around much anymore
