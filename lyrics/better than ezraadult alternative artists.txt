Looking around the house Hidden behind the window and the door Searching for signs of life But there's nobody home Well, maybe I'm just too sure Or maybe I'm just too frightened by the sound of it Pieces of note fall down, but the letter said Aha, it was good, living with you Aha, it was good, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah Aha, it was good, living with you Aha, it was good, ah-ah-ah Good, good, good, good, good, good Sitting around the house Watching the sun trace the shadows on the floor Searching for signs of life But there's nobody home Well, maybe I'll call or I'll write you a letter Now maybe we'll see on the fourth of July But I'm not too sure, and I'm not too proud Well I'm not sure, and I'm not too proud to sayPassed the road to your house That you never called home Where they turned out your lights Though they say you'll never know I remember running through the wet grass Falling a step behind Both of us never tiring Desperately wanting When they pumped out your guts Filled you full of those pills You were never quite right Deserving all the chills Said the worst is over Take it over again Then they ask what went wrong When they turn you on again Don't they turn you on again I remember running through the wet grass Falling a step behind Both of us never tiring Desperately wanting I remember running through the wet grass Falling a step behind Both of us never tiring Desperately wantingAllie woke up 8 AM Graduation day Got into a car And crashed along the way When we arrived late to the wake Stole the urn while they Looked away And drove to the beach'Cause I knew you'd want it That way And you were standing On the hood of the car Singing out loud When the sun came up And I know I wasn't right But it felt so good And your mother didn't mind Like I thought she would And that R EM song was playing In my mind And three and a half minutes Felt like a lifetimeGot an angel on the stairs As if you'd even care When the lights are up And the sun had nearly gone down Did you see him on the street Did you pass him at your feet Did you think at all, "How dare they even look me in the eye"?And he loves the girls And he loves the boys Going to make twenty dollars Before the weekends over So set him up To let him fall Turn him over in your hands God save the King of New Orleans Got a ticket to a show Going to see him take a blow When the drunk one said"Cat Stevens was the greatest singer!"And did you kick him in the head Did you see the blood run down Did you laugh at all, when the people walked right by and said aloud"Gutter punks are all the same Probably make twenty dollars 'fore the weekends over "Maybe I should drop you at your door Or leave tonight and vanish up the shore Anywhere but here It's three o clock we're driving in your car You're screaming out the window at the stars"Please don't drive me home"Blame us cause we are who we are Hate us cause you'll never get that far And who'd suppose you would go I've already learned enough to know Tell me all the places we could go And count the headlights passing on the road A long long time ago Blame us cause we are who we are Hate us cause you'll never get that far And who'd suppose you would go I've already learned enough to know Here we are Foreign to their world Straight and composed Your sermons I can do without And I finally found that everybody loves to love you When you're far awayHow can you be so warm How can you know what I feel Well, it's the way you move your hands And it's the way you understand And that's the reason that I'm asking Hey-ee-yay-I And that's the reason that I want to know Hey-ee-yay-I And that's the reason that I'm asking Hey-ee-yay-I And that's the reason that I'm How can you throw away everything you live for Well it's the way we shake and sway Oh And it's the passion that you play And that's the reason that I'm asking Hey-ee-yay-I And that's the reason that I want to know Hey-ee-yay-I And that's the reason that I'm asking Hey-ee-yay-I And that's the reason that I'mThere are six and three-quarter billion people in this world And 51 percent of them are girls You roll your eyes like I'm full of it But I Googled that shit And if the world is four times bigger than the moon Tell me how on Earth did I find you We're just two grains of sand blowing on the beach Damn that's deep It's like faith, God, or the Big Bang It's just one of them things that you can't explain And I don't need to know why Maybe we're crazy, crazy lucky Maybe we're crazy, crazy lucky And I'm just one in a billion guys But the way the way you love me Has got me feelin' crazy crazy lucky Feelin' like oh oh oh like we're crazy lucky There are so many reasons why we shouldn't have met I could've turned right when you turned left But the

Fischer!Still I couldn't get arrested Though I got more hooks Than Madonna got looks And just like that A C/D C song Come on baby, shake me all night long All I want to do Is stay till early in the morning And all I've got to say Is your love's extra ordinary You're extra ordinary, baby Somebody push me through the door I been sleeping on the floor Thirty-one flavors, listen to the neighbors Through the wall At a debutante ball Cumba lada vista!Got a Mona Lisa!So much for the late rent Cause your money's spent And it's cold inside But just like that Barenaked Ladies' song I'm hot like wasabi when I'm next to your body All I want to do Is stay till early in the morning And all I've got to say, yeah Is your love's extra ordinary You're extra ordinary, baby Ain't love such a sweet thing!Ain't love such a sweet thing!All I want to do Is stay till early in the morning And all I've got to say, yeah Is your love's extra ordinary You're extra ordinary, babyWell there's a feeling in the air Just like a Friday afternoon Yeah you can go there if you want Though it fades to soon So go on Let it be If there's a feeling coming over me Seems like it's always understood This time of year Well I know there's a reason to change Well I know there's a time for us You think about the good times, and you live with all the bad You can feel it in the air Feeling right this time of year Well there's a football in the air Across a leaf blown field Yeah and there's your first car on the road And the girl you'd steal So go on With yourself It there's a feeling that there's something else Seems like it's always understood This time of year
