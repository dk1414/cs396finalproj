I walked across an empty land I knew the pathway like the back of my hand I felt the earth beneath my feet Sat by the river, and it made me complete Oh, simple thing, where have you gone I'm getting old and I need something to rely on So tell me when you're gonna let me in I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin I came across a fallen tree I felt the branches of it looking at me Is this the place we used to love Is this the place that I've been dreaming of Oh, simple thing, where have you gone I'm getting old and I need something to rely on So tell me when you're gonna let me in I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin And if you have a minute, why don't we go Talk about it somewhere only we know This could be the end of everything So why don't we go Somewhere only we know Somewhere only we know You say you wander your own land But when I think about it I don't see how you can You're aching, you're breaking And I can see the pain in your eyes Says everybody's changing And I don't know why So little time Try to understand that I'm Trying to make a move just to stay in the game, I Try to stay awake and remember my name, but Everybody's changing And I don't feel the same You're gone from here Soon you will disappear Fading into beautiful light'Cause everybody's changing And I don't feel right So little time Try to understand that I'm Trying to make a move just to stay in the game, I Try to stay awake and remember my name, but Everybody's changing And I don't feel the sameThis is the last time That I will say these words I remember the first time The first of many lies Sweep it into the corner Or hide it under the bed Say these things, they go away But they never do Something I wasn't sure of But I was in the middle of Something I forget now But I've seen too little of The last time You fall on me for anything you like Your one last line You fall on me for anything you like And years make everything alright You fall on me for anything you like And I, no, I don't mind This is the last time That I will show my face One last tender lie and Then I'm out of this place Tread it into the carpet Or hide it under the stairs You say that some things never die Well, I tried and I triedA turning tide Lovers at a great divide Why do you laugh When I know that you're hurt inside And why'd you say It's just another day, nothing in my way I don't wanna go, I don't wanna stay So there's nothing left to say And why'd you lie When you wanna die, when you hurt inside Don't know what you lie for anyway Now there's nothing left to say A tell-tale sign You don't know where to draw the line And why'd you say It's just another day, nothing in my way I don't wanna go, I don't wanna stay So there's nothing left to sayMany's the time I ran with you down The rainy roads of our old town Many the lives we lived in each day And buried all together Don't laugh at me Don't look away You'll follow me back With the sun in your eyes And on your own Bedshaped on legs of stone You'll knock on my door And up we'll go In white light I don't think so But what do I know  What do I know I know I know you think I'm holding you down And I've fallen by the wayside now And I don't understand the same things as you But I doWell they said you were a bright child Never anything but joy behind your eyes No sign of all the dark clouds Spreading like volcanic dust over your blue skies Now they're looking for an answer Where the rot set in and set up the landslide But it only makes it worse now You're like a puzzle to be worked out And it's the voices in your head now Saying there's something wrong about the way I feel A broken link, a missing part, a punctured wheel And it's not what you expected The way the world you built loves to cut you down The way your head gets twisted And you sit up all night trying to figure it out And they say you've made your bed now Don't you see you've brought it on yourself And they say that you should move on But you can't even get your shoes onI wanna hand you my heart and let you carry the load Nobody tells you anything you need to know I need a friend but a friend is so hard to find I need an answer but I'm always one step behind Cause it takes time Learning to fly Do you ever feel like all you want is to go home To kiss the earth, to weave a way through this storm Some days I rage like a fire in the wilderness Some days I only need the darkness and a place to rest Oh it takes time Learning to fly Tear up this town Blinking in the sunlight as the walls come down This fire will burn Digging for a truth that just can't be found Don't want your lessons in love I want to tear it all upI, I always thought that I knew I'd always have the right to Be living in the kingdom of the good and true And so on, but now I think I was wrong And you were laughing along And now I look a fool for thinking you were on my side Is it any wonder I'm tired Is it any wonder that I feel uptight Is it any wonder I don't know what's right Sometimes It's hard to know where I stand It's hard to know where I am Well, maybe it's a puzzle I don't understand But sometimes I get the feeling that I'm Stranded in the wrong time Where love is just a lyric in a children's rhyme A sound bite Is it any wonder I'm tired Is it any wonder that I feel uptight Is it any wonder I don't know what's right When you, when you forget your name When old faces all look the same Meet me in the morning when you wake up Meet me in the morning then you'll wake up If only I don't bend and break I'll meet you on the other side I'll meet you in the light If only I don't suffocate I'll meet you in the morning when you wake Bitter and hardened heart Ah  Aching, waiting for life to start Meet me in the morning when you wake up Meet me in the morning then you'll wake up If only I don't bend and break I'll meet you on the other side I'll meet you in the light If only I don't suffocate I'll meet you in the morning when you wakeWhy do I have to fly Over every town up and down the line I'll die in the clouds above And you that I defend I do not love I wake up, it's a bad dream No one on my side I was fighting But I just feel too tired to be fighting Guess I'm not the fighting kind Where will I meet my fate Baby, I'm a man; I was born to hate And when will I meet my end In a better time you could be my friend I wake up, it's a bad dream No one on my side I was fighting But I just feel too tired to be fighting Guess I'm not the fighting kind Wouldn't mind it If you were by my side But you're long gone Yeah, you're long gone now
