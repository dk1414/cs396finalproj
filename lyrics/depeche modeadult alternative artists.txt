Words like violence break the silence Come crashing in into my little world Painful to me, pierce right through me Can't you understand  Oh, my little girl All I ever wanted All I ever needed is here in my arms Words are very unnecessary They can only do harm Vows are spoken to be broken Feelings are intense, words are trivial Pleasures remain, so does the pain Words are meaningless and forgettable All I ever wanted All I ever needed is here in my arms Words are very unnecessary They can only do harmReach out and touch faith Your own personal Jesus Someone to hear your prayers Someone who cares Your own personal Jesus Someone to hear your prayers Someone who's there Feeling unknown and you're all alone Flesh and bone by the telephone Lift up the receiver, I'll make you a believer Take second best, put me to the test Things on your chest you need to confess I will deliver, you know I'm a forgiver Reach out and touch faith Reach out and touch faith Your own personal Jesus Someone to hear your prayers Someone who cares Your own personal Jesus Someone to hear your prayers Someone who's thereI'm taking a ride with my best friend I hope he never lets me down again He knows where he's taking me Taking me where I want to be I'm taking a ride with my best friend We're flying high We're watching the world pass us by Never want to come down Never want to put my feet back down on the ground I'm taking a ride with my best friend I hope he never lets me down again Promises me I'm as safe as houses As long as I remember who's wearing the trousers I hope he never lets me down again We're flying high We're watching the world pass us by Never want to come down Never want to put my feet back down on the ground We're flying high We're watching the world pass us by Never want to come down Never want to put my feet back down on the groundYou had something to hide Should have hidden it, shouldn't you Now you're not satisfied With what you're being put through It's just time to pay the price For not listening to advice And deciding in your youth On the policy of truth Things could be so different now It used to be so civilized You will always wonder how It could have been if you'd only lied It's too late to change events It's time to face the consequence For delivering the proof In the policy of truth Never again is what you swore The time before Never again is what you swore The time beforeWasted feelings Broken meanings Time is fleeting See what it brings Hellos, goodbyes, a thousand midnights Lost in sleepless lullabies Heaven's dreaming Thoughtless thoughts, my friends We know we'll be ghosts again Sunday's shining Silver linings Weightless hours All my flowers A place to hide the tears that you cried Everybody says goodbye Faith is sleeping Lovers, in the end Whisper we'll be ghosts againWhen I'm with you baby I go out of my head And I just can't get enough And I just can't get enough All the things you do to me And everything you said I just can't get enough I just can't get enough We slip and slide as we fall in love And I just can't seem to get enough of We walk together We're walking down the street And I just can't get enough And I just can't get enough Every time I think of you I know we have to meet And I just can't get enough And I just can't get enough It's getting hotter, it's a burning love And I just can't seem to get enough ofYou've been kept down You've been pushed 'round You've been lied to You've been fed truths Who's making your decisions You or your religion Your government, your countries You patriotic junkies Where's the revolution Come on, people You're letting me down Where's the revolution Come on, people You're letting me down You've been pissed on For too long Your rights abused Your views refused They manipulate and threaten With terror as a weapon Scare you till you're stupefied Wear you down until you're on their sideWrong Wrong Wrong Wrong I was born with the wrong sign In the wrong house With the wrong ascendancy I took the wrong road That led to the wrong tendencies I was in the wrong place at the wrong time For the wrong reason and the wrong rhyme On the wrong day of the wrong week I used the wrong method with the wrong technique Wrong Wrong There's something wrong with me chemically Something wrong with me inherently The wrong mix in the wrong genes I reached the wrong ends by the wrong means It was the wrong plan in the wrong hands With the wrong theory for the wrong man The wrong eyes on the wrong prize The wrong questions with the wrong repliesPrecious and fragile things Need special handling My God, what have we done to you We always tried to share The tenderest of care Now look what we have put you through Things get damaged, things get broken I thought we'd manage But words left unspoken left us so brittle There was so little left to give Angels with silver wings Shouldn't know suffering I wish I could take the pain for you If God has a master plan That only He understands I hope it's your eyes He's seeing through Things get damaged, things get broken I thought we'd manage But words left unspoken left us so brittle There was so little left to givePeople are people, so why should it be You and I should get along so awfully People are people, so why should it be You and I should get along so awfully So we're different colours and we're different creeds And different people have different needs It's obvious you hate me, though I've done nothing wrong I've never even met you, so what could I have done I can't understand What makes a man Hate another man Help me understand People are people, so why should it be You and I should get along so awfully People are people, so why should it be You and I should get along so awfully
