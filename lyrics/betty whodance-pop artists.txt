Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream Of light mist, of pale amber rose Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent Touching, discovering you Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me Miles of windless summer night air Secret moments shared in the heat of the afternoon Out of the stillness, soft spoken words I love you always, forever Near and far, closer together Everywhere I will be with you Everything, I will do for you I love you always, forever Near and far, closer together Everywhere I will be with you Everything, I will do for you You've got the most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen You've got me almost melting away As we lay there, under a blue sky with pure white stars Exotic sweetness, a magical timeWe all wanna believe Wanna believe in something'Cause if we believe in nothing Then what do we have  What do we have We all wanna be loved All wanna love somebody'Cause if we ain't got nobody Then what do we have  What do we have If you're hearing this, I'm at King and 5th Eight to ten I'll sit at this table for two In a Dodgers cap, drinking coffee black Wondering where you're at I'll be waiting, be waiting for you I've been waiting, been waiting for you We all wanna believe Wanna believe in something'Cause if we believe in nothing Then what do we have  What do we have We all wanna be loved I wanna love somebody'Cause if we ain't got nobody Then what do we have  What do we have Good love is so hard to find We got it right for a while Do you get lonely at night We don't have to go home We don't have to go Low lights, cold nights, remember when I call you every now and then So good, that on and off again And on again Oh, why don't you come over Baby, be close to me, just like you used to be Oh, one more night to hold ya We don't have to call it love, we just need a human touch We don't have to call it love, we just need a human touch I always loved how you kiss And I'm overdue for a fix Just with a touch of your lips I want you to come home I want you to come homeWhat would your mama say Come with me, I'm what you need I light you up, 'cause I can see the fire in your eyes Welcome to your fantasy, your wildest dreams I'll show you things you never knew you liked What if we kiss just like this Go insane tonight What would your mama say What would your mama say You know you love a pretty girl with a twisted mind And you love it when my lovin' hurts, you tell me all the time So don't apologize, give it to me one more time You know you love a pretty girl What would your mama say Take me on the floor, yeah, I adore the way it's yours And no one else can do it right Elevator, kitchen table, any flavor, what's your favorite Tell me what you like Holding on to secrets Gripping handle bars on the road Racing home at sunset With the last light into the glow Ooh, I let you love me right back Ooh, it's easy how we lose track We talk all night, we talk all day Wish I could meet you on the other side The bedroom lights keep us awake Wish I could meet you on the other side On the other side, on the other side On the other side, on the other side Taking in this moment Say "I love you" under my breath Though your heart is stolen It's like your voice is right in my hands Ooh, I let you love me right back Ooh, it's easy how we lose trackIt's a long, cold walk after midnight When you send me home'Cause she comes 'round late and she hates it When we're left alone She's beautiful, and I just can't compete But I'd ride with you, die with you I'd spend my life with you Stuck with me, fuck with me So come make love to me I know she's sweet, but she isn't me Where she lies in your eyes That's where I wanna be When a stranger says we look good together, we just laugh If you only knew how it hurts 'cause you're my other half This nightmare has become my favorite dream'Cause I'm standing in for a love that is the real thing You know I need you'Cause I'd ride with you, die with you I'd spend my life with you Stuck with me, fuck with me So come make love to me I know she's sweet, but she isn't me Where she lies in your eyes That's where I wanna be That's where I wanna be3 A M and all my friends are looking at me sideways Give me a minute Maybe I'm too drunk and I'm not doing this the right way But let me finish I'm so happy that you're happy with her Almost called you, tried to text you like a million times3 A M, but I don't care, I had to tell you someday The way I'm feeling I can still feel you, you're everywhere I can taste your lips, hear your voice in my head And I know that I should shut my mouth And just hang up the phone, but I still want you I just thought you should know Bet you're in the kitchen hoping she don't hear you whisper Just admit it Do you ever think of me when you lean in to kiss her Do you miss it  'Cause I can still feel you, you're everywhere I can taste your lips, hear your voice in my head And I know that I should shut my mouth And just hang up the phone, but I still want you I just thought you should knowClap your hands if it feels good It does indeed, goddamnit I've been thinking we're meant to be But I don't know how to show you the best of me Yeah, I want you,

The rest of my life is some kinda wonderful We will always be some kinda wonderful Some kinda wonderfulI should know better by now But it's twenty to two and you know that I want some Should be drinking 'em down But he poisoned my mind any time that I'm on one Every tomorrow I wake up and pray it's the day That I won't miss it or want it or need him to stay But he's already on his way You know the worse they are, the better they taste All my cravings come at night This ain't love, it's sacrifice Oh my God, I can't behave The worse they are, the better they taste I got a big appetite If I look then I touch then it's already over I wish I could just take a bite So I do, I don't think I can sink any lower Every tomorrow, I wake up and pray I won't be'Caught in the sugar, your sour, your salty, your sweet I'm starving, so give it to me You know the worse they are, the better they'll beI know that you don't love me anymore I know that you don't love me anymore I know that you don't love me like you did before, before So I get higher than that party that you hated in the valley'Cause I'll never say I'm sorry But, oh God, I am, I'm sorry Now there's fire burning in the valley Do you think you'll ever end up happy When the smoke clears, I can see the stars down here Yeah, maybe they look brighter by the sea But I know where I'm going in the valley And, babe, I'm coming home to the valley
