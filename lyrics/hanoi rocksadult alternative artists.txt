The nights are wearing me down And it's hard getting through the day'Cause I need you right now And right now you're so faraway I guess that I should have known That I'd end up this way But I swear I'll come home And then nothing will drag me away Don't you ever leave me, baby Don't you ever leave me now Don't you ever leave me, baby If you leave me you will kill me now Now that some much time has passed I know that this love of ours will last forever'Cause we feel it, take it, hold it and believe it You need me like I need you I know you do, I'm sure you do The lights are slowly going down On Lexington Avenue And me, I'm all alone feeling the tears Falling down from my eyesWell the music's slowly dying and I'm jumping outta my jeans I jump into the bed, you're there already waiting for me Ain't this a perfect way to spend the night There ain't no better way of killing time than loving you Be sure of that I do It's reached top speed and I'm getting inside of you Well this is hot stuff mama, taste it, it sure tastes good, oh yes it does It may be cold outside but in you the fire is burning And when you bite me woman, I know, love is hurting Oh tragedy life reminds me 'bout a symphony on the radio First a little bit too fast and then a little bit much too slow Tragedy life reminds me 'bout a symphony I heard today First a little bit too fast and then a little bit much too slow for me I wake up in the morning and I feel the pain in my head If it's the rest I need I'd rather be dead No destinations in this life I live No expectations, I just drift and drift and drift Life is likeLate at night as I lay down to sleep I think of all the secrets people keep Like how I feel for you Do you feel it too Or is it something we have to resume We're just two people watching time fly by In a world in it's obvious decline But we are young and strong We can carry on Find a little Paradise of our own'Cause no one saves the day It's no one else's fault If you're a day late or a dollar short Just think about how lovely life could be Excluding all the man-made misery If we're too far behind And really out of time Is there another world they plan to find Took too much of this, had too much of that But with you I never got enough I thought there'd never be love in my life And that's sad 'cos when I think what I could've had It makes me feel so bad I smoked a lot of sky, I drank a lot of rain Anything to ease my pain But now your touch is all it would take And that's a shame 'cos I can never come home again And you're a million miles away I'll never get a chance to hold you So my message is the wind I pray that it gets through to you Loving you was so easy And leaving you was so very hard And now I'm living in this ocean of blue In the corner of a prison yard I should have listened to you Now you're a million miles away I never get a chance to hold you Please don't be thinking of me Please just forget about meThere's a place up ahead and I'm goin'Just as fast as my feet can fly Come away Come away, if you're goin'Leave the sinkin' ship behind Come on the risin' wind We're goin' up around the bend Bring a song and a smile for the banjo Better get while the gettin's good Hitch a ride to the end of the highway Where the neons turn to wood Come on the risin' wind We're goin' up around the bend Yeaah!Do do do dah..Do do do dah..Do do do dah..Do do do dah..You can ponder perpetual motion Fix your mind on a crystal day Always time for a good conversation There's an ear for what you sayFor your love I'd give anything For your time stars above And if I ever get you I'll never let you go Don't deny, you have seen me before Realize, look me in the eye just a while I got love 'n I won't hide it Now when I finally found it Hey you hey you where did you come from From supermarket corridor Hey you, hey you what's going on While I turn my head away you had gone the other way Away, oh there she walks again I have to be her boyfriend Hey you, it's true, Baby, there I stood When I looked her in the eye She gave me her sweet sweet smile Don't deny, you have seen me before Realize, look me in the eye just a while I got love 'n I won't hide it Now when I finally found it I've seen you many times before For each time you mean more I'd like to be always yours So it's up to you Please take me home with youDon't you ever leave me baby Don't you ever leave me now Don't you ever leave me baby If you leave you will kill me now The lights are slowly going down Alexington avenue And me I'm all alone Watching the rain falling down on my face A lot of people passing by I don't think they recognize me They fade away Into the night That's when i think about you Don't you ever leave me baby Don't you ever leave me now Don't you ever leave me baby If you leave you will kill me now I stop living in the memory of you I stop living in the memory of you I stop living in the memory of you I stop living in the memory Of youI don't wanna hurt you, I don't wanna see you cry, I don't wanna hurt you once more I don't wanna leave now, I don't wanna sight for sore eyes Gone sore of all the tears that we cried Hey, come here with the guitar  Okay Recall the times we met, so wild, wild and free We had our ups and we had our downs And the sweet, sweet rock'n'roll playing on the radio We grew up and we learned the rules You gotta fight to win, otherwise you'll lose Oh Cheyenne, you imprisoned me in liberty Never, ever showed me no sympathy Remember that night, how you made me cry I almost lost my mind When it appeared that the winner was you and the loser was me That night, that endless lonely nite...I just can't think of you, with another man Oh Cheyenne, you must understand Just stay right where you are, I'll pick you up anyway, any day around I'll be with you You don't have to worry, you don't have to worry, baby, don't you worry You don't have to worry no moreFriday is the 13th, to 24th is not so long to go Though my face don't show, my temperature is gettin' too-o low I've seen it all in a dream, I know just how it's gonna feel I'd like not to be alive anymore I'll be dead by X-mas now anyway Tell me will you remember me that day When you've found a new one who's better than I ever was I'll be dead by X-mas now anyway Please give all my things away They'll make great X-mas presents for you and for all my friends It hurts so inside to see you with another from the edge of a cloud Whatever happened to the promises that you gave Before the angels took me away So here I'm all dressed in white While you're drinking up my best red wine And you don't even realize I'm with you all the time I'll be dead by X-mas now anyway Tell me will you remember me that day When you've found a new one who's better than I ever was I'll be dead by X-mas now anyway Please give all my things away They'll make great X-mas presents for you and for all my friendsI've been drinkin' quite a lot lately Been thinkin' of the times when you made a star Times do change and we must Rearrange our lives with it I'd like to send you a postcard but still don't Know your address, don't remember your name It's funny how your face is still in my eyes...Hidden by a tear I do believe in that one day you'll rise again I'll always keep on believing It gives me strength to carry on Without love through dark nites...A million miles away
