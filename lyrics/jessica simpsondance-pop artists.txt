Ooh, ooh Ooh, ah You set my soul at ease Chased darkness out of view Left your desperate spell on me Say you feel it too I know you do I've got so much more to give This can't die, I yearn to live Pour yourself all over me And I'll cherish every drop here on my knees I wanna love you forever And this is all I'm asking of you Ten thousand lifetimes together Is that so much for you to do 'Cause from the moment that I saw your face And felt the fire in your sweet embrace I swear I knew I'm gonna love you forever, ah My mind fails to understand What my heart tells me to do And I'd give up all I have just to be with you And that would do I've always been taught to win And I never thought I'd fall Be at the mercy of a man I've never been Now I only want to be right where you areOh-oh, oh-oh The real me is a Southern girl With her Levi's on and an open heart Wish I could save the world, like I was Supergirl The real me used to laugh all night Lying in the grass, just talkin' 'bout love But lately, I've been jaded Life got so complicated I start thinkin' about it I almost forgot what it was like To know what it feels like But with you I can let my hair down I can say anything crazy I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground With nothin' but a T-shirt on I never felt so beautiful Baby, as I do now Now that I'm with you]Are you ready, boots  Start walkin' Yee-haw Let’s go You keep saying you got something for me Well, officer, I don’t mind to say you do Now you're looking right where I thought you’d be looking Legs come in handy when the law's in front of you]These boots are made for walking That's just what they’ll do One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you Alright You believe you've stopped me for a reason Now I'm pretending my bending's just for fun You keep playing where I got you playing, yeah These double 'D' initials work to run These boots are made for walking That's just what they’ll do One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over youYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Oh-oh Oh-oh-oh Every time you're near, baby I get kinda crazy in my head for you And I don't know what to do And, oh, baby I get kinda shaky when they mention you I just lose my cool My friends tell me Something has come over me And I think I know what it is I think I'm in love Boy, I think that I'm in love with you Got me doin' silly things when it comes to you Boy, I think that I'm in love with you I been tellin' all my friends what I feel for you Just the other night, baby I saw you hanging, you were with your crew I was with mine too You took me by surprise When you turned and looked me in my eyes Boy, you really blew my mind You know I don't know what it is But everything about you is so irresistible Don't you try to tell me that he's not my type To hide what I feel inside When he makes me weak with desire I know that I'm supposed to make him wait Let him think I like the chase But I can't stop fanning the fire I know I meant to say, "no"But he's irresistible Up close and personal Now inescapable I can hardly breathe More than just physical, deeper than spiritual His ways are powerful Irresistible to me Oh, I can hardly breathe Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right That I should really say goodnight But I just can't stop myself falling Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same I don't wanna play no game 'Cause when I feel his arms wrapped around me I know I meant to say, "no" Oh the weather outside is frightful But the fire is so delightful And since we've no place to go Let it snow  Let it snow  Let it snow!It doesn't show signs of stopping And I've bought some corn for popping The lights are turned way down low Let it snow  Let it snow  Let it snow!When we finally kiss goodnight How I'll hate going out in the storm!But if you'll really hold me tight All the way home I'll be warm The fire is slowly dying And, my dear, we're still goodbying But as long as you love me so Let it snow  Let it snow  Let it snow!When we finally kiss goodnight How I'll hate going out in the storm!But if you'll really hold me tight All the way home I'll be warmThere go the street lights The night's officially on I got the green light To do whatever we want Gonna stand outside, the box And put the rules on hold Tonight Carte blanche, first class for the evening Ready, set, go All the girls stepping out for a public affair All the cameras come out for a public affair Hey, baby, I see you looking over here, baby Are you gonna keep looking or get up And talk to me Here's an opportunity that you don't wanna

what it is galore You want thingamabobs I got twenty But who cares No big deal I want more I want to be where the people are I want to see Want to see them dancing Walking around on those What you call them Oh - feet Flipping your fins you don't get too far Legs are required for jumping, dancing Strolling along down a What's that word again Street Up where they walk Up where they run Up where they stay all day in the sun Wandering free Wish I could be Part of that world What would I give If I could live Out to these waters What would I pay To spend a day Warm on the sand Betcha on land They understand Bet they don't reprimand their daughters Bright young women Sick of swimming Ready to stand And I'm ready to know what the people know Ask them my questions And get some answers What's a fire and why does it What's the word  Burn When's it my turn Wouldn't I love Love to explore that shore up above Out of the sea Wish I could be Part of that worldOhh, baby Mary, did you know that your baby boy Would someday walk on water Mary, did you know that your baby boy Would save our sons and daughters Did you know that your baby boy Has come to make you new This child that you've delivered Will soon deliver you Mary, did you know Mary, did you know Mary, did you know that your baby boy Will give sight to a blind man Mary, did you know that your baby boy Will calm a storm with his hand Did you know  that your baby boy Has walked where angels trod When you kiss your little baby You have kissed the face of God Mary, did you know Ding, Dong Ding, Dong Ding, Dong Ding, Dong
