think of two Love lost, such a cost Give me things that don't get lost Like a coin that won't get tossed Rolling home to you Old man, take a look at my life, I'm a lot like you I need someone to love

little bit closer, hear what I have to say Just like children sleeping, we could dream this night away But there's a full moon rising, let's go dancing in the light We know where the music's playing, let's go out and feel the night Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again Because I'm still in love with you On this harvest moon When we were strangers, I watched you from afar When we were lovers, I loved you with all my heart But now it's getting late and the moon is climbing high I want to celebrate, see it shining in your eye Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again Because I'm still in love with you On this harvest moonI want to live, I want to give I've been a miner for a heart of gold It's these expressions I never give That keep me searchin' for a heart of gold And I'm getting old Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold And I'm getting old I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line That keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold And I'm getting old Keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold And I'm getting oldTin soldiers and Nixon coming We're

their feet People sleeping in their shoes There’s a warning sign on the road ahead There’s a lot of people saying we’d be better off dead Don’t feel like Satan, but I am to them So I try to forget it any way I can Keep on rockin' in the free world Keep on rockin' in the free world Keep on rockin' in the free world Keep on rockin' in the free world I see a woman in the night With a baby in her hand There's an old street light Near a garbage can Now she put the kid away and she’s gone to get a hit She hates her life and what she’s done to it There’s one more kid that’ll never go to school Never get to fall in love, never get to be coolOh, Alabama The devil fools with the best laid plan Swing low, Alabama You got the spare change, you got to feel strange And now the moment is all that it meant Alabama, you got the weight on your shoulders That's breaking your back Your Cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch And a wheel on the track Oh, Alabama Banjos playing through the broken glass Windows down in Alabama See the old folks tied in white robes Hear the banjo, don't it take you down home Alabama, you got the weight on your shoulders That's breaking your back Your Cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch And a wheel on the trackI caught you knockin' at my cellar door I love you, baby, can I have some more Ooh, ooh, the damage done I hit the city and I lost my band I watched the needle take another man Gone, gone, the damage done I sing the song, because I love the man I know that some of you don't understand Milk-blood to keep from running out I've seen the needle and the damage done A little part of it in everyone But every junkie's like a settin' sunWell I dreamed I saw the knights in armor comin'Sayin' something about a queen There were peasants singin' and drummers drummin'And the archer split the tree There was a fanfare blowin' to the sun That was floating on the breeze Look at Mother Nature on the run In the 1970s Look at Mother Nature on the run In the 1970s I was lyin' in a burned out basement With the full moon in my eyes I was hopin' for replacement When the sun burst though the sky There was a band playin' in my head And I felt like getting high I was thinkin' about what a friend had said I was hopin' it was a lie Thinkin' about what a friend had said I was hopin' it was a lie Well, I dreamed I saw the silver space ships flyin'In the yellow haze of the sun There were children cryin' and colors flyin'All around the chosen ones All in a dream, all in a dream The loadin' had begun Flying Mother Nature's silver seed To a new home in the sun Flying Mother Nature's silver seed To a new home
