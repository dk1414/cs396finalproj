Realign all the stars above my head Warning signs travel far I drink instead On my own Oh, how I've known The battle scars and worn out beds Gentle now a tender breeze blows Whispers through a Gran Torino Whistling another tired song Engines hum and bitter dreams grow Heart locked in a Gran Torino It beats a lonely rhythm all night long These streets are old They shine with the things I've known And breaks through the trees Their sparkling Your world is nothing more than all the tiny things You've left behind So tenderly your story is nothing more than what you see Or what you've done Or will become Standing strong Do you belong In your skin Just wonderingAfter years of expensive education A car full of books and anticipation I'm an expert on Shakespeare, and that's a hell of a lot But the world don't need scholars as much as I thought Maybe I'll go traveling for a year Finding myself, or start a career I could work with the poor, though I'm hungry for fame We all seem so different, but we're just the same Maybe I'll go to the gym, so I don't get fat Aren't things more easy with a tight six-pack Who knows the answers, who do you trust I can't even separate love from lust Maybe I'll move back home and pay off my loans Working nine to five answering phones Don't make me live for my Friday nights Drinking eight pints and getting in fightsTruth, truth isn't something I learned I feel like it's something you earn Restless and hungry for future stories Of days where we all live our lives in the graves And the hymns of your heroes of phrase Don't lose your memories prematurely If it's true what they say about love and affection I'll open my eyes to a door that is flowing with Flowing with, flowing with Drink, drinking in all of the sunshine Reminding ourselves that there's no time To wander around in the cold Pain, pain is just part of your day So suck it up, learn how to play And down your first pint of the sunshine stories It's true if it's all over now, baby blue Did you listen when I told you to Live out your life in a blaze of glory It's getting late I'm making my way over to my favorite place I gotta get my body moving Shake the stress away I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way Possible candidate Who knew That you'd be up here looking like you do You're making staying over here impossible Baby I must say your aura is incredible If you don't have to go, don't Do you know what you started I just came here to party Now we're rocking on the dancefloor Acting naughty Your hands around my waist Just let the music play We're hand in hand Chest to chest Now we're face to face I wanna take you away Lets escape into the music DJ let it play I just can't refuse it Like the way you do this Keep on rockin to it Please don't stop the Please don't stop the musicI missed the opportunity To get you babe to stay with me Never thought, I'd regret the excuses that I've made Like a song, it will fade If there's music in the night And it's really, really right It's the only thing I need It intoxicates your mind All your troubles left behind So come on and take my lead It's not just me who feels it Music plays a mind trick Watch me forget about missing you So I put my feelings out to dry Love, one day again I'll have to try Falling out, making up It seems such a silly game Why do I never gain If there's music in the night And it's really, really right It's the only thing I need It intoxicates your mind All your troubles left behind So come on and take my lead It's not just me who feels it Music plays a mind trick Watch me forget about missing youEverybody wants to be a cat Because a cat's the only cat Who knows where it's at Tell me, everybody's pickin' up on that feline beat Cause everything else is obsolete Now a square with a horn Can make you wish you weren't born Every time he plays But with a square in the act You can set music back To the caveman days I've heard some corny birds who tried to sing Still a cat's the only cat Who knows how to swing Who wants to dig A long-haired gig Or stuff like that When everybody wants to be a cat A square with that horn Makes you wish you weren't born Every time he plays oh a rinky, tinky, tinkyYou asked me over and over and over Have you seen my peacock feathered hat If it was under a four leaf clover I'd be on the lawn lookin' for that Where is your heart at  Nobody knows that Even though you've, him, her, me and an army searching I've got a feeling you will be reeling When you are bad and the circus comes to town And you'll see me leaving dressed up As a magician or something like that Your satin and flip-flops are hidden in the Pockets of your velvet dressing gown Your diamond cufflinks are hidden in the Ruffles of your silk white shirt from town Where is your heart at  Nobody knows that Even though you've, him, her, me and an army searching I've got a feeling, you will be reeling When you are bad and the circus comes to town And you'll see me leaving dressed up As a magician or something like that, heyHello innocence Though it seems like we’ve been friends for years I’m finishing How I wish I had never begun Though it should be the last one And it’s dragging me down to my knees Where I’m begging you please Let me go Don’t you know I’m all over it now And I can't say how glad I am about that I’m all over it now‘cause I worked and I cursed and I tried And I said I could change and I lied Where there’s something still moves me inside Yeah She’s a melody That I’ve tried to forget but I can’t It still follows me When I wake in the dead of the night And I know that I can’t fight That song going round in my head Like the last thing she said:Right now the world looks so exciting But that first rung it feels so cold The air up there looks so inviting You'll do the rest when you are old The printed pictures they stain your hands It's like a memory you don't own The architecture of your grand plan Designed to put you on the throne The bitter taste of the unknown I'll tell you for nothing you're not the only one singing singing Trying to bring to life your dreams I'll tell you for nothing you're not the only one who believes I don't know if you're gonna make it How many girls you're gonna know I don't know if you'll pay your dad back With front row tickets to your show Right now your snare drum is a trash can Your bedroom shadows are your stage Your old best friend he is your one fan He'll watch the light inside you fadeKnow this is a universal truth People let you down So reach out for the things that you can use Buried in the ground I think I've been misunderstood Not all of my choices have been good In a fading light So we should put this one to bed Before it bursts out of my head Ready for the fight So when it get's too late And I find my place Who will save your soul and love me here So when it get's too far So well let down your guard Who will save your soul and love me here Inside of another tiny life Full of big ideas Strikes me with the baggage left behind I could dry those tears
