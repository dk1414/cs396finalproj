I gave you all of me and more But you went and threw it out the door I, did everything you asked of me But you took my love for granted Now you're begging me not to leave If I once told you that I loved you, I now regret it If I once told you that I loved you I know now that I must've been crazy If I once told you that I loved you And that I'd give the world to hold you If I once told you that I loved you, I will never again Because my love is over and dead And I, know one day you'll realize That you, didn't even say your goodbye I, did everything you asked of me But you took my love for granted Now you're begging me not to leaveI, gave you all of me and more But you, went and threw it out the door I, did everything you asked of me But you took my love for granted Now you're begging me not to leave Si una vez dije que te amaba, I now regret it Si una vez dije que te amaba I know now that I must've been crazy If I once told you that I loved you And that I'd give the world to hold

blanca y morena Cuide su imagen, manténgase al margen don Este ángel se arma de coraje en el Armagedón Como Agamenón, un mito griego en el Partenón Reparto gol como Diego Soy Lego pongo mi arte en on Y la activo, sigo guardando mi rap en archivo Con contraseña así se empeña en descifrar que digo Difícil como en Argelia encontrar un soldado herido Sin fusil que se la ingenia pa' no ser colgado en vivo Y no va a tener lápida será un desconocido No lo sabe ni la mitad de este mundo podrido Por suerte tengo cualidad de sonar corrosivo Y si voy sobreviviendo es que se me hace pan comido Sigo vivo sin dormir domingos Si con Smirnoff brindo y golpea como un low kick Domino el ping pong con joystick Y por mil combino la garra de Pirlo con los skills de Modric Intento plasmar mi estampa en Marpla y todo el mapa Aunque no hago trampa ni doble tempo Me ampara a pleno una lámpara Para poner mis amplios planes en papel como planos de un arquitecto Soy lluvia en tu pantalla táctil Dormiste mal por mis temas los sistemas te fallan pero tranqui Como yo quieren ser Formula Uno y por un apuro chocan Sigan con su laburo corriendo en karting Invento técnicas y no me cuestan Son mi huella en el cemento y mi respuesta la gente que le molesta Esos intentos de estrellas de cine Que odian que combine métricas sublimes con instrumentos de orquesta Caen caras como caen fichas de dominó No quiero pasar desapercibido ser un anónimo Traje un mensaje para pintarlo en un sonido Y firmar como un tag en un grafo mi pseudónimo L-E-G-O, el jefe llego, aléjense del eje Que el tiempo ya se teje en ese reloj Herejes creen cuando ven a un dios o algo que se le asemeje Asi que despejen y déjenmelos No me aleje de mis orígenes me origine de genes de aborigen al morir me regeneraré Me limite y eliminé el germen Que rige que me fije solo en la mujer que exije semen y eso ser mas menHey  Ladies and gentlemen… It's time to party  So that means, While I'm at my mother fucking table, And I'm trying to
