Alabama, Arkansas, I do love my Ma and Pa Not the way that I do love you Well, holy moly, me oh my, you're the apple of my eye Girl, I never loved one like you Man, oh, man, you're my best friend, I scream it to the nothingness There ain't nothing that I need Well, hot and heavy pumpkin pie Chocolate candy, Jesus Christ There ain't nothing please me more than you Oh, home, let me come home Home is whenever I'm with you Oh, home, let me come home Home is whenever I'm with you La-la-la-la, take me home Honey , I'm coming home I'll follow you into the park Through the jungle, through the dark Girl, I never loved one like you Moats and boats and waterfalls, alleyways and pay phone calls I been everywhere with you Laugh until we think we'll die, barefoot on a summer night Never could be sweeter than with you And in the streets, you run a-free, like it's only you and me Geez, you're something to seeThe book of love is long and boring No one can lift the damn thing It's full of charts and facts and figures And instructions for dancing But I, I love it when you read to me And you, you can read me anything The book of love has music in it In fact that's where music comes from Some of it is just transcendental Some of it is just really dumb But I, I love it when you sing to me And you, you can sing me anything The book of love is long and boring And written very long ago It's full of flowers and heart-shaped boxes And things we're all too young to knowI don't want to get over you I guess I could take a sleeping pill And sleep at will And not have to go through what I go through I guess I should take Prozac, right And just smile all night At somebody new Somebody not too bright But sweet and kind Who would try to get you off my mind I could leave this agony behind Which is just what I'd do If I wanted to But I don't want to get over you'Cause I don't want to get over love I could listen to my therapist Pretend you don't exist And not have to dream of what I dream of I could listen to all my friends And go out again And pretend it's enoughAlabama, Arkansas, I do love my Ma and Pa Not the way that I do love you Well, holy moly, me oh my, you're the apple of my eye
