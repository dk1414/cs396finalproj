It starts with one One thing, I don't know why It doesn't even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme To explain in due time, all I know Time is a valuable thing Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings Watch it count down to the end of the day The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal Didn't look out below Watch the time go right out the window Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know I wasted it all just to watch you go I kept everything inside And even though I tried, it all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually be A memory of a time when I tried so hard I tried so hard and got so far But in the end, it doesn't even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end, it doesn't even matterShould've stayed, were there signs I ignored Can I help you not to hurt anymore We saw brilliance when the world was asleep There are things that we can have, but can't keep If they say Who cares if one more light goes out In the sky of a million stars It flickers, flickers Who cares when someone's time runs out If a moment is all we are Or quicker, quicker Who cares if one more light goes out Well I do The reminders pull the floor from your feet In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair Just 'cause you can't see it doesn't mean it isn't there If they say Who cares if one more light goes out In the sky of a million stars It flickers, flickers Who cares when someone's time runs out If a moment is all we are Or quicker, quicker Who cares if one more light goes out Well I doI'm tired of being what you want me to be Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface I don't know what you're expecting of me Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow Every step that I take is another mistake to you Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow I've become so numb, I can't feel you there Become so tired, so much more aware I'm becoming this, all I want to do Is be more like me and be less like you Can't you see that you're smothering me Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control'Cause everything that you thought I would be Has fallen apart, right in front of you Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow Every step that I take is another mistake to you Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow And every second I waste is more than I can takeI don’t like my mind right now Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary Wish that I could slow things down I wanna let go but there’s comfort in the panic And I drive myself crazy Thinking everything's about me Yeah, I drive myself crazy'Cause I can’t escape the gravity I'm holding on Why is everything so heavy Holding on So much more than I can carry I keep dragging around what's bringing me down If I just let go, I'd be set free Holding on Why is everything so heavy You say that I'm paranoid But I’m pretty sure the world is out to get me It’s not like I make the choice To let my mind stay so fucking messy I know I'm not the center of the universe But you keep spinning 'round me just the same I know I'm not the center of the universe But you keep spinning 'round me just the sameYeah Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind  Ah, uh, whoo, yeah  Ready Whoo, whoo, whoo!Let's go!Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boys So for one last time I need y'all to roar Uh, uh, uh, uh Now, what the hell are you waiting for After me, there shall be no more So for one last time, nigga, make some noise Get 'em Jay!Who you know fresher than Hov  Riddle me that The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at Can't none of y'all mirror me back, yeah, hearin' me rap Is like hearin' G Rap in his prime, I'm Young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express Out the country but the blueberry still connect On the low but the yacht got a triple deck But when you Young, what the fuck you expect  Yep, yep!Grand openin', grand closin'Goddamn, your man Hov cracked the can open again Who you gon' find doper than him With no pen, just draw off inspiration-tion Soon you gon' see you can't replace him-him With cheap imitations for these generationsCrawling in my skin These wounds, they will not heal Fear is how I fall Confusing what is real There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface Consuming, confusing This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending Controlling, I can't seem To find myself again, my walls are closing in Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take I've felt this way before, so insecure Crawling in my skin These wounds, they will not heal Fear is how I fall Confusing what is real Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me Distracting , reacting Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection It's haunting  how I can't seemI got a long way to go And a long memory I been searching for an answer Always just out of reach Blood on the floor Sirens repeat I been searching for the courage To face my enemies When they turn down the lights I hear my battle symphony All the world in front of me If my armor breaks I’ll fuse it back together Battle symphony Please just don’t give up on me And my eyes are wide awake For my battle symphony For my battle symphony They say that I don’t belong Say that I should retreat That I’m marching to the rhythm Of a lonesome defeat But the sound of your voice Puts the pain in reverse No surrender, no illusions And for better or worse When they turn down the lightsMemories consume like opening the wound I'm picking me apart again You all assume I'm safe here in my room Unless I try to start again I don't want to be the one the battles always choose'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way, I know it's not alright So I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit tonight Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door I try to catch my breath again I hurt much more than anytime before I had no options left again I don't want to be the one the battles always choose'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confusedIn this farewell There's no blood, there's no alibi'Cause I've drawn regret From the truth of a thousand lies So let mercy come and wash away What I've done I'll face myself to cross out what I've become Erase myself and let go of what I've done Put to rest what you thought of me While I clean this slate With the hands of uncertainty So let mercy come and wash away What I've done I'll face myself to cross out what I've become Erase myself and let go of what I've doneSo say goodbye and hit the road Pack it up and disappear You better have some place to go'Cause you can't come back around here Good goodbye Live from the rhythm, it's Something wild, venomous Enemies trying to read me You're all looking highly illiterate Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix You won't find an equivalent I've been here killing it Longer than you've been alive, you idiot And it makes you so mad Somebody else could be stepping in front of you And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one There's more than one of you And you can't understand the fact That it's over and done, hope you had fun You've got a lot to discuss on the bus Headed back where you're from
