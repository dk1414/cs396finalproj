Call it love and devotion Call it a mom's adoration, foundation A special bond of creation, ha For all the single moms out there Goin' through frustration Clean Bandit, Sean da Paul Anne-Marie, sing, make them hear She works the nights by the water She's gone astray, so far away From her father's daughter She just wants a life for her baby All on her own, no one will come She's got to save him She tells him, "Ooh, love No one's ever gonna hurt you, love I'm gonna give you all of my love Nobody matters like you" She tells him, "Your life Ain't gon' be nothin' like my life You're gonna grow and have a good life I'm gonna do what I've got to do" Ooh, oh-oh We're a thousand miles from comfort We have travelled land and sea But as long as you are with me There's no place I'd rather be I would wait forever Exalted in the scene As long as I am with you My heart continues to beat With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay Strolling so casually We're different and the same, gave you another name Switch up the batteries If you gave me a chance, I would take it It's a shot in the dark, but I'll make it Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be N-n-no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be N-n-no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be N-n-no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be I've been hearin' symphonies Before, all I heard was silence A rhapsody for you and me And every melody is timeless Life was stringin' me along Then you came and you cut me loose Was solo, singin' on my own Now I can't find the key without you And now your song is on repeat And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat And when you're gone, I feel incomplete So, if you want the truth I just wanna be part of your symphony Will you hold me tight and not let go Symphony Like a love song on the radio Will you hold me tight and not let go I'm sorry if it's all too much Every day you're here, I'm healin'And I was runnin' outta luck I never thought I'd find this feelin''Cause I've been hearin' symphonies Before all I heard was silence A rhapsody for you and me And every melody is timelessIt solo, solo, everybody It solo, e-e-e-everybody It solo, solo, everybody I never meant to leave you hurtin'I never meant to do the worst thing Not to you 'Cause every time I read your message I wish I wasn't one of your exes Now I'm the fool Since you've been gone I've been dancin' on my own There's boys up in my zone But they can't turn me on'Cause, baby, you're The only one I'm comin' for I can't take no more No more, no more I wanna f— , but I'm brokenhearted Cry-cry-cry, but I like to party Tou-tou-touch, but I got nobody Here on my own I wanna f— , but I'm brokenhearted Cry-cry-cry since the day we parted Tou-tou-touch, but I got nobody So I do it soloI tried hard to make you want me But we're not supposed to be And the truth will always haunt me Even though it set me free And my tears flow like the ocean As they floated in the breeze They were falling in slow motion And they brought me to my knees You're haunting me, taunting me all in my brain Turn off the light and now all that remains Fills me with doubt And I'm shouting your name out loud Why do you wanna put me through the pain I get the feeling I'll never escape I can't hide away from the shame of you Tears on the ground, tears on my pillow You won't bring me down And I'll get over you These tears will get me through And I'll get over youI know you're out in Cabo Hanging with your brother Wishin' that I was your bottle So I could be close to your lips again I know you didn't call your parents and tell 'em that we ended'Cause you know that they'd be offended Did you not want to tell 'em it's the end And I know we're not supposed to talk But I'm getting ahead of myself I get scared when we're not'Cause I'm scared you're with somebody else So, I guess that it's gone And I just keep lying to myself Oh, I can't believe it, I-I miss you, yeah, I miss you I miss you, yeah, I miss you, oh, I do I miss you, yeah, I miss you Though I’m tryin’ not to right now You weren't a fan of pictures So I hardly ever took 'em Got them saved in my mind from the bedroom So that way I can't forget your skin So I saved all the texts All of the best over the years Just to remind myself of how good it is, or wasSé que te gusto a ti todavía Tres, dos, uno Standing here in an
