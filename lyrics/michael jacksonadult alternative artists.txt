She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one Who will dance on the floor in the round "She said I am the one Who will dance on the floor in the round She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one Who will dance on the floor in the round People always told me, "Be careful of what you do Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love And be careful of what you do 'Cause the lie becomes the truth" , hey-ey Billie Jean is not my lover, uh She's just a girl who claims that I am the one But the kid is not my son She says I am the one But the kid is not my son For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side But who can stand when she's in demand  Her schemes and plans'Cause we danced on the floor in the round So take my strong advice Just remember to always think twice Do think twice  She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine 'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby Ow!Cha!Shoo-cha-choo-cha!As he came into the window Was a sound of a crescendo He came into her apartment He left the bloodstains on the carpet She ran underneath the table He could see she was unable So she ran into the bedroom

suiting you right You were just fine as a real thing, thing You, you, you know That's not the way to get over me I don't know what you're sayin'You, you, you know That's not the way to get over me All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more All of a sudden you say that I closed the door It don't matter to me It don't matter to me what you say It don't matter to me It don't matter to me what you say I can't recover from our last conversation You called me weak And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other You wanted me to gon' put my hands on you Just to show you I love you You know I can't jeopardize both our reputations Despite what you say Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer You're actin' out, you know you love to see me down Stressin' over somethin' It's close to midnight And something evil's lurking in the dark Under the moonlight You see a sight that almost stops your heart You try to scream But terror takes the sound before you make it You start to freeze As horror looks you right between the eyes You're paralyzed'Cause this is thriller, thriller night And no one's gonna save you From the beast about to strike You know it's thriller, thriller night You're fighting for your life inside a killer Thriller tonight, yeah Ooh You hear the door slam And realize there's nowhere left to run You feel the cold hand And wonder if you'll ever see the sun You close your eyes And hope that this is just imagination But all the while You hear a creature creepin’ up behind You're out of timeWhy Looking out, across the nighttime The city winks a sleepless eye Hear her voice, shake my window Sweet seducing sighs Get me out, into the nighttime Four walls won't hold me tonight If this town is just an apple Then let me take a bite If they say why , why Tell them that it's human nature Why , why , does he do me that way If they say why , why Tell them that it's human nature Why , why , does he do me that way Reaching out to touch a stranger Electric eyes are everywhere See that girl, she knows I'm watching She likes the way I stareI'm gonna make a change For once in my life It's gonna feel real good Gonna make a difference Gonna make it right As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat This wind is blowin' my mind I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top And one man's soul They follow each other on the wind, ya know'Cause they got nowhere to go That's why I want you to know I'm starting with the man in the mirror I'm asking him to change his ways And no message could have been any clearer If you wanna make the world a better place Take a look at yourself and then make a change Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love It's time that I realize There are some with no home Not a nickel to loan Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart And a washed-out dream They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see'Cause they got no place to be That's why I'm starting with meThey told him, "Don't you ever come around here Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear So beat it, just beat it You better run, you better do what you can Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man You wanna be tough, better do what you can So beat it, but you wanna be bad Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it No one wants to be defeated Showin' how funky and strong is your fight It doesn't matter who's wrong or right Just beat it Just beat it Just beat it Just beat it They're out to get you, better leave while you can Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man You wanna stay alive, better do what you can So beat it, just beat it You have to show them that you're really not scared You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare They'll kick you, then they'll beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair So beat it, but you wanna be badOw!Ow!I took my baby on a Saturday bang Boy, is that girl with you Yes, we're one and the same Now, I believe in miracles And a miracle has happened tonight, hee!But if you're thinking about my baby It don't matter if you're Black or White, ooh!They print my message in the Saturday Sun I had to tell 'em I ain't second to none And I told about equality and it's true Either you're wrong or you're right, ooh!But if you're thinking about my baby It don't matter if you're Black or White, ooh
