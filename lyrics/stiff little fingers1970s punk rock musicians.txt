I met you in no man's land Across the wire, we were holding hands Hearts a bubble in the rubble It was love at bomb site But all you give me is barbed wire love We're all caught up in barbed wire love Tangled up in barbed wire love Throw my leg over barbed wire love And barbed wire love snags my jeans Barbed wire love Barbed wire love Barbed wire love When I fell, it was awful nice Caught when not suspectin' vice The night was rife with wasteland life You set my arm alight All you give me is barbed wire love  All caught up in barbed wire love  Tangled up in barbed wire love  Throw my leg over barbed wire love  Barbed wire love  snags my jeansThere's nothin' for us in Belfast The Pound's old and that's a pity Ok so there's the Trident in Bangor And then you walk back to the city We ain't got nothin' but they don't really care They don't even know you know They just want money We can take it or leave it What we need Is an alternative Ulster Grab it and change itâ€”it's yours!Get an alternative Ulster Ignore the bores and their laws Get an alternative Ulster Be an anti-security force Alter your native Ulster Alter your native land Take a look where you're livin'You got the Army on the street And the R UC dog of repression Is barking at your feet Is this the kind of place you wanna live Is this where you wanna be Is this the only life we're gonna have What we needI think it's time we talked this over I think you've taken this too far I never wanted to be different Didn't ask to be nobody's star Try to take control of it Cos what you see is what you get Try to take control of it And not me You say there's talk of revolution - so what's new You say there's fighting in the air You think that I've got the solutions But do you really think that's fair Try to take control of it Cos what you see is what you get Try to take control of it And not me Alright now Don't wanna be nobody's hero Don't wanna be nobody's star Don't wanna be nobody's hero Get up get out be what you are You think it's time you took me over To do what you can't do yourself But don't let heroes get your kicks for you It's up to you and no-one else Try to take control of it Cos what you see is what you get Try to take control of it And you'll seeInflammable material planted in my head It's a suspect device that's left 2000 dead Their solutions are our problems They put up the wall On each side time and prime us Make sure we get fuck all They play their games of power They cut and mark the pack They deal us to the bottom But what do they put back Don't believe them Don't believe them Don't be bitten twice You gotta suss, suss, suss, suss, suss, suss Suss suspect device They take away our freedom In the name of liberty Why can't they all just clear off Why can't they let us be They make us feel indebted For saving us from Hell And then they put us through it It's time the bastards fellRastus was a nigga, thug mugger junkie Black golly gob, big horny monkey Pimp pusher coon, grinning piccaninnies Send him home soon, back to the trees!Black wogs, black wogs Your face don't fit Black wogs, black wogs You ain't no Brit!Ahmed is a Paki, curry coffee queer Ten to a bed, flocking over here Tax-sponging canker, smelly thieving kids Ponce greasy wanker, worse than the yids!Brown wogs, brown wogs Your face don't fit Brown wogs, brown wogs You ain't no Brit!Stick together we'll be all right me and you The only colours we need are red, white and blue Paddy is a moron, spud thick Mick Breeds like a rabbit, thinks with his pick Anything floors him if he can't fight or drink it Round them up in Ulster, tow it out and sink it Friday night's here, what's to see Nothing to do, you know what I mean Nothing on the telly There is no late-night show No shows in town, there is no place to go Here we are nowhere, nowhere left to go Is it a crime to be young 'Cause every time we have some fun They put us down and tell us that we're wrong Every time, they sing the same old song Here we are nowhere, maybe that's where we belong You know it's never what they would do But that could be that I'm looking at you And sitting there won't change a thing Must we only wonder what the future will bring Two, three, fourGotta gotta gettaway, gotta gotta gettaway You know there ain't no street like home To make you feel so all alone Plenty of folk to tell you what to do But they don't speak the same language as you They wanna have me here Have me and hold me near Hold me down fasten and tie But the cars are all flashing me Bright lights are passing me I feel life passing me by The fuss is buzzing in my head My father argued and my mother begged It's not their words ain't tugging at me But gotta stretch them break them get myself free Gotta gotta gettaway, gotta gotta gettaway I'm leaving homePunctuality, waste of time Now nostalgia is past its prime History's a thing of the past Being first just cannot last Beep, beep, I'm an answering machine I mean to say I say what I mean Beep, beep, I've got very strong views Plug in any loop tape you choose My one single fault is modesty I'm changing my views consistently Amnesia's something I try to forget Who can't kick gambling  Want to bet Beep, beep, I'm an answering machine I mean to say I say what I mean Beep, beep, I've got very strong views Plug in any loop tape you choose The case for racism is black and white If you want world peace, you've got to fight Must do what you're told to be free Think what you like if you agree with meHe joined up to get a job And show he wasn't scared Swapped boy scout hat for army cap He'd finally be prepared At the age of 17, he was forced to choose At the age of 21, he's in Catch 22 Hey He joined up for just three years It seemed a small amount But they didn't tell him That the first two didn't count At the age of 17, how was he to know That at the age of 21, he'd still have one to go Tin soldier He signed away his name Tin soldier No chance for cash or fame Tin soldier Now he knows the truth Tin soldier He signed away his youthI met you in no man's land Across the wire, we were holding hands Hearts a bubble in the rubble It was love at bomb site But all you give me is barbed wire love We're all caught up in barbed wire love Tangled up in barbed wire love Throw my leg over barbed wire love And barbed wire love snags my jeans Barbed wire love Barbed wire love Barbed
