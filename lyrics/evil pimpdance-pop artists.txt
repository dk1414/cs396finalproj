I summoned the prince of darkness By the power of the pact we seal one sweet and faithful night He is our most frightening symbol of evil; The tempter, the soul snatcher who goes by many names    Tonight is a full moon and Friday the  13th  An auspicious night  for satanist who are into dark magic and the ancient practice of calling the devil to work I'm meeting with a man who calls himself a high priest of the first church of Satan  Thanks to the internet he is a shadowing mentor for the thousands of kids he communicates with online See I worship devil shit to keep the demons in my head Close my eyes and now I'm sweatin', tossin', turnin' in my bed Making homicides, demons fly as I increase my high Satan now appears but just in shadow and it's time to ride Slowly rub my eyes to clear my head cuz I'm not seein straight Lucifer repeats "It's time to go" but still I hesitate Rubbin' and washin' my hands right on my jeans Cause theres' a bloody mess Figurin' out what did I do To get these cuts all on my hands and chest Feelin' so satanic in a panic and I'm full of rage Now I'm placed in prison, locked away up at an early age So I grab and cock my Glock and get my ass up on the creep Niggas talkin' shit about my clique are buried six feet deep Walk into the living room and call my roomates to the den Then I start to buck and leave them buckas Shoot up all my friends Now I'm
