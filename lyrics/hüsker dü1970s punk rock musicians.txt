I'm curious to know exactly how you are I keep my distance, but that distance is too far It reassures me just to know that you're okay But I don't want you to go on needing me this way And I don't want to know if you are lonely Don't want to know if you are less than lonely Don't want to know if you are lonely Don't want to know, don't want to know The day you left me, left me feeling oh so bad Baby, I'm not sure about all the doubts we had From the beginning we both knew it wouldn't last Decisions have been made, the die has been cast And I-I don't want to know if you are lonely Don't want

the air like pollen from a flower Somewhere in April time, they add another hour I guess I better think up a way to spend my time Just when I'm ready to sit inside, it's summertime Should I go swimming or get a friend to hang around It's back to summer, it's back to basics, hang around Getting drunk out on the beach or playing in a band And getting out of school meant getting out of hand Was this your celebrated summer Was that your celebrated summer Was this your celebrated summer Then the sun disintegrates between a wall of clouds I summer where I winter at, no one is allowed there Do you remember when the first snowfall fell When summer barely had a snowball's chance in hell Was this your celebrated summer Was this your celebrated summer Was this your celebrated summer Summertime Summertime Summertime SummertimeTime heals, time goes on, and time really flies Time hurts and time can cut you, cut you down to size There's no need to touch you now, no, I'm doing fine Life too can cut you and I've cut you out of mine You're making me Sorry, sorry somehow You're making me Sorry, sorry somehow There's no need to talk to you, well, to know what's on your mind There's no need to see you either, no, I'm just being kind You want me to beg forgiveness, tender an apology It's not my fault and you're not getting one from me You're making me Sorry, sorry somehow You're

to tell me When I'm right or when I'm wrong It's the same thing in your mind The only time I'm right is when I play along When I play along Walking around with your head in the clouds It makes no sense at all Sell yourself short, but you're walking so tall It makes no sense at all Is it important  You're yelling so loud It makes no sense at all Walking around with your head in the clouds Makes
