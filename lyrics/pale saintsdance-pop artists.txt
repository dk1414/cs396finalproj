Kinky love Kinky, I'm mad about you Kinky love I need you so bad I need you, kinky love Kinky, you're all that I've been thinking of Kinky, take me inside and let the honey slide I need you, kinky love Good to me Kinky, do all the things you should to me Wake up, I'm nervous Sleep inside of me Open your gates and let the river free Oh, kinky, take me inside and let the honey slide I need you, kinky love Late at night In my bed as I lie here Somewhere in limbo land Half awake, half asleep Halfway somewhere elseThe sight of you The sight of you Makes me feel blue Makes me feel blue The things you said The things you said Make me feel bad My heart is sad I think of him I think of him Soaked all in red I wish him dead You say that he You say that he's Nothing like me But how can that be What can I do What can I say The world was large And I felt very small What's gonna happen How will I know When things are back The way they used to be before Sepia snapshot Narrating my previous life And a mountain of other lies Numbers and letters Surfacing from a sea of Treacle blackened stone And carrying me back home I hear the language of flowers And now i don't hear anything else Voices from nowhere seducing me To all the lyrics of the world My balance has been disturbed Time stumbles drunkenly While lives are frozen Until they're born again Ripening in the sun I hear the language of flowers And now i don't hear anything else I wasn't cut out for this But my heart was I wasn't cut out for thisIt's eating you away and some will never know it's taste Biting off more than you can chew again You're just a child And all you know is That it's sweetness brings you Close to tears Each time you can't resist And some will never know it's taste You're flying high Oblivious to what it does It's eating you away And it moves much faster Than you can view It's eating you away And some will never know it's taste Some will never know it's tasteTear the world in two And choose a half But look inside you You know what you are I've seen it through And you will too I can tell that you Feel these things too Know yourself And teach yourself to walk Into the hole Exploding in your thoughts I've seen it through And you will too I can tell that you Feel these things too I've seen it through And you will too I can tell that you Feel these things too I've seen it through And you will too You tear the world in two I'll destroy youI'm tired of too much of this And this is wearing me thin There are too many hours And too many ways to fill them in Fine friend, you're a fine friend When will I see Fine friend, you're a fine friend You've been an anchor for me I'm tired of holding my breath There's too much that's been left to say But I know tomorrow the smile on your face Will smooth these thoughts away Fine friend, you're a fine friend When will I see Fine friend, you're a fine friend You've been an anchor for meWaiting for a sign from you Waiting for the signal to change Have you forgotten what your love can do Is this the end Walking through the city Your boots are high heeled And are shining bright The sun was sparkling on the shaft of your knife Glowering in the morning rain Dying in my hands Was it all in vain Superstar in your own private movie I wanted just a minor part But I'm no fool I know you're cool I never really wanted your heart Keeper of the key Nothing seems to bring you down It's not that cool when i'm around Flower in the morning rain Dying in my hands Was it all in vain Superstar in your own private movie I wanted just a minor part But I'm no fool I know you're cool I never really wanted your heartNo longer cradled In gravity's memory Staring and spinning In fragments of endlessness Spinning in torment Into the blinding whiteDreaming too long Wake up Sultan Hear your blood, an ocean roaring Feel your clothes, the nesting Of the naked fishes' mouths inside your skin Now your senses Grow impatiently Feel the light is landing On the surface of your being Like you're dragging an old dress along a floorBreaking through Into the water's heat It won't be long It's impossible to understand There's no way of knowing And no way out Take a breath And tear it up It's not enough As the sky gets nearer So does time You'll never know what You left behind The only way is down As the sky gets nearer So does time You'll never know what You left behind The only way is down
