ice pick, stick it in a vise grip Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch Like Vice President Mike Pence Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and Jesus Christ, man, how many times is Someone gonna fuck on my bitch  You won't ever see Em icy But as cold as I get on the M-I-C I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick Turn down for what I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up 'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut Now when it doesn't matter what caliber I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks You'll turn around and just be like, "Man, how the fuck Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks And now he wants to take it out on us" But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy Of The Mathers L P to tell me to study It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry Especially an effing Recovery clone of me So finger-bang, chicken wang, M GK, Igg' Azae'Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name I'm fed up with bein' humble And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it I guess when you walk into B K you expect a Whopper You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to Mc Donald's But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned And you woulda bought it But sayin' I no longer got it'Cause you missed a line and never caught it'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic With a bottle full of malt liquor But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet I don't see why y'all even started with me I get in beefs, my enemies die I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased I'm east side, never be caught slippin'Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze"Aw, man  That B ET cypher was weak, it was garbage The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!"Shout to all my colorblind people Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green Aquamarine, or you think water is pink"Dawg, that's a date" — "Looks like an olive to me""Look, there's an apple!" — "No, it's not, it's a peach!"So finger-bang, Pootie Tang Burger King, Gucci

slaughterhouse, bitch  Invite 'em in like a One A Day I'm not done 'Cause I feel like the beast of burden That line in the sand, was it even worth it 'Cause the way I see people turning's Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict Or still yet to be determined 'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent Sold the dream to that he's deserted But I think it's workin'These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous And he's too scurred to answer me with words'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered But I know at least he's heard it'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists I said, "Only when it comes to ink and lyricists"But my beef is more media journalists I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist Can get a mouthful of flesh And yes, I mean eating a penis'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death So I've been givin' the media fingers Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh But they've been puttin' me through the ringer So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press But I just took this beat to the cleanersObie Trice, real name, no gimmicks *record scratch*Two trailer park girls go round the outside Round the outside, round the outside Two trailer park girls go round the outside Round the

And started whoopin' her ass worse than before They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture It's the return of the "Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding He didn't just say what I think he did, did he "And Dr  Dre said… nothing, you idiots!Dr  Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement Feminist women love Eminem"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though"Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms Sometimes I wanna get on T V and just let loose But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss And that's the message that we deliver to little kids And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is By the time they hit fourth grade They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals Who cut other people open like cantaloupes But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—
