Well I don’t know you but I feel you You feel it too Coming at you through the tall grass My lies come through Cause then I’m frozen in stereo, and It fucks me up, sad injury the first degree Set yourself free Take it on faith, my love Baby just one time Picture life from my eyes Take it on faith, my love I know you All my leafs they fall for you You fall in too Cause I’m sinking with an over silence I don’t know you but I feel you You feel it too Sad injury of the first degree Set yourself free Take it on faith, my love Baby just one time Picture life from my eyes Take it on faith, my love I know you I never knew her Have a little faith Give it now You meant forever, die Kill my mind, so have a lil’ faith Show a little love Give a little heart Take it on faith, my love Baby just

my love Take it on faith, my love Take it on faith, my loveOur doves still fly our doves still sing This kinda love is a vicious thing‘Cause all I ever want All I ever need is your crazy love If we’d never met you’d never be this sad You don’t have to forget what you never had But all I ever want All I ever need is your crazy love So bring on the heartache my love Just never let us be apart And bring on the heartache Your love is not for the faint of heart But all I ever want All I ever need is your crazy love So bring on the heartache my love Just never let us be apart And bring on the heartache Your love is not for the faint of heart Friday I met you Saturday we fell in love By Sunday it all fell through And started all over againSomeone light up the sunset with my heart Come find me and save me ‘neath the stars All I wanted was a memory Come pull some diamonds from the sands of time I mean, come on, let’s face it, we ain’t that young Let’s paint this town red with our blood All I wanted was a good time But I don’t have fun if I ain’t with you Under the stars, the stars a-shinin’Well I’ve been loveless much too long Sing one for the soldiers that defend my heart‘Cause she defeats them slowly with precision charm All I wanted was my freedom But I don’t feel free if I ain’t with you Under the stars, the stars a-shinin’Well I’ve been loveless much too long Burn up my ticket, ashes to the wind Cut my ties open, slash them with your grin All I wanted was a sense of place But I don’t feel home if I ain’t with youHe wants the life-changing song on a white cassette Old melody I'll never forget Gettin' me a triple-triple & a B.C.D The good times'll be on me Chorus:Throw in the shifter 1 2 & 3 Find me the queen of Portland street Out in the five-runner out in the rain Me and G chasing hurricanes So come on Lanny cut me a deal I work so hard and I never steal In the 827 punched out my lights Down at Rudy's last Saturday night I know this road like the back of my hand From the donair temple to the L-Town sand Me & G'll meet you down in the dunes With the moon and the tunes yeah we'll be there soon So come on Lanny cut me a deal I work so hard and I never steal In the 827 punched out my lights Down at Rudy's last Saturday nightReach out and grab my alien hand You always like it best when I don’t understand Your mistakes walk around in big tall shoes Who in the hell do you think you’re talking to I gotta get it wrong before I get it right I’m always feeling better when I’m up all night You gotta trust life What you think that you got you still need to get The one that got away that you haven’t met yet Life’s a trip we’ll never make it through It’s been so nice to spend it with you I gotta get it wrong before I get it right I’m always feeling better when I’m up all night You gotta trust life You gotta trust life Hang on to anything keeping you alive We’re gonna get it wrong before we get it right I’m always feeling better when I’m up all night You gotta trust life You gotta trust life Hang on to anything keeping you aliveWell play me anything that makes my heart sing man Never turn this car around We’ll set fire to the smokes and drive all night Looking for that golden lonesome sound There ain’t no saints out on the highway tonight Just a couple lost and lonely drunken seekers We hear the tires on the ice but we ain’t scared‘Black Rose’ is blowing out them speakers Free man now You’re free Up in the arms of them drunken angels Dancing on the moon Well I’m all coiled up and ready to strike Like a viper in the rough in the setting sun Shocked and terrified Like a sniper in the grass long after the war is done I miss you in my bed I miss your heartbeat sound I swear to god sometimes I can still feel it And the things I said to you still shatter my head But you knew me so well you knew I never meant it Set fire to my smoke and drive all night Looking for that golden lonesome soundHey barman get it right this time Pour some life into these jaws of mine Life is only real if you’re a memory Cause this old coyote has seen too much With the sha la la’s and the such n’ such Life is only real if you’re a memory Howl at the night I’m at this party they’re all talking too much I should be home with the wife and two kids in my clutches I guess that’s not exactly where this night is going So I’ll just keep faith in the rhythm and trust myself And you my god I love you You some memory All I wanted was you All I wanted was you Howl at the night Howl at the night Enter a new life Say your prayers And fall into a new life All I wanted was youI met her in the spring When the earth began to breathe again She snuck in with the dawn And just like summer she was gone Lonely is just a word And it don’t mean shit to me Cause I’m a hummingbird in hawk wings Designed to be free And all your dark promises are gone And the tears that fall down my face Soon will turn to stone now And all your dark promises are gone Cause I’m sick of throwing stones up at your window Broken hearts beat harder On highways built along the water How many times do I gotta tell you It’s all in your mind Nothing is what it seems We’re just dust in the arclight beams Shining off the back of my eyelids While I lay here While I lay here trying to dreamBabe, it seems like so long Since you heard your favourite song playing downtown, playing downtown And, oh, it seems like awhile Since the country's been in style, so now I'm downtown, now I'm downtown I never really understood why I'm here in the city You're in them fields, walking around I've been seeing too much trouble here and not enough you I've been standing here for days Searching for some kinda change, but I've had no luck to speak of Take a trip out of the heart babe Where the trains and troubles start, if you're downtown, if you'rе downtown Well, I never rеally understood why I'm here in the city You're in them fields, walking around I've been seeing too much trouble here and not enough of you I've been seeing too much trouble here and not enough of you Babe, it seems like so long Babe, it seems like so long Babe, it seems like so long So long, so long, so longYou wake up with a strange new feeling like you might be saved And the fever breaks Like a perfect wave So you get out of bed and smile at yourself up in the mirror And that missing part of you Has never been clearer Let there be love Let there be love Let there be love Let there be love Dancing through the ghost and glitter Of the last parade Down the same street from once You were to afraid to go And you start missing who Means everything to you You reach out with your hands And you feel them coming back I’m through to you And you finally understand Let there be love Let there be love Let there be love Let there be love
