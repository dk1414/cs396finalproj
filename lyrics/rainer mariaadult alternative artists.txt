Before us great Death stands Our fate held close within his quiet hands.When with proud joy we lift Life's red wine To drink deep of the mystic shining cup And ecstasy through all our being leaps—Death bows his head and weeps Wake me up this morning And take me down to the corner Place before the shade Where we eat and that's where we talk Retreats behind the wall and And that's when I decide to stay here Wake me up this morning And take me down to the corner Place before the shade Where we eat and that's where we talk Retreats behind the wall and And that's when I decide to stay here Cup of tea, blackberry Golden Gate Bridge Everything's alright now Don't let me sleep It was warm and pleasant And over in an instant I feel like I dreamt it But I'm not there now But I'm not there nowHis vision, from the constantly passing bars,has grown so weary that it cannot hold anything else.It seems to him there are a thousand bars;and behind the bars, no world.As he paces in cramped circles, over and over,the movement of his powerful soft stridesis like a ritual dance around a centerin which a mighty will stands paralyzed.Only at times, the curtain of the pupils lifts, quietly--.An image enters in,rushes down through the tensed, arrested muscles,plunges into the heart and is gone My loves drink deep Love, lust and fire I hear them cry I hear them weep Will You Be Mine Every time they speak Street lights like fire Every time they call I answer polite Will You Be Mine Slam shut The doors To lower To lowerParis February 17, 1903 Dear Sir,Your letter arrived just a few days ago  I want to thank you for the great confidence you have placed in me  That is all I can do  I cannot discuss your verses; for any attempt at criticism would be foreign to me  Nothing touches a work of art so little as words of criticism: they always result in more or less fortunate misunderstandings  Things aren't all so tangible and sayable as people would usually have us believe; most experiences are unsayable, they happen in a space that no word has ever entered, and more unsayable than all other things are works of art, those mysterious existences, whose life endures beside our own small, transitory life.With this note as a preface, may I just tell you that your verses have no style of their own, although they do have silent and hidden beginnings of something personal  I feel this most clearly in the last poem, "My Soul." There, some thing of your own is trying to become word and melody  And in the lovely poem "To Leopardi" a kind of kinship with that great, solitary figure does perhaps appear  Nevertheless, the poems are not yet anything in themselves, not yet any thing independent, even the last one and the one to Leopardi  Your kind letter, which accompanied them managed to make clear to me various faults that I felt in reading your verses, though I am not able to name them specifically.You ask whether your verses are any good  You ask me  You have asked others before this  You send them to magazines  You compare them with other poems, and you are upset when certain editors reject your work  Now  I beg you to stop doing that sort of thing  You are looking outside, and that is what you should most avoid right now  No one can advise or help you - no one  There is only one thing you should do  Go into yourself  Find out the reason that commands you to write; see whether it has spread its roots into the very depths of your heart; confess to yourself whether you would have to die if you were forbidden to write  This most of all: ask yourself in the most silent hour of your night: must I write  Dig into yourself for a deep answer  And if this answer rings out in assent, if you meet this solemn question with a strong, simple "I must", then build your life in accordance with this necessity; your whole life, even into its humblest and most indifferent hour, must become a sign and witness to this impulse  Then come close to Nature  Then, as if no one had ever tried before, try to say what you see and feel and love and lose  Don't write love poems; avoid those forms that are too facile and ordinary: they are the hardest to work with, and it takes a great, fully ripened power to create something individual where good, even glorious, traditions exist in abundance  So rescue yourself from these general themes and write about what your everyday life offers you; describe your sorrows and desires, the thoughts that pass through your mind and your belief in some kind of beauty Describe all these with heartfelt, silent, humble sincerity and, when you express yourself, use the Things around you, the images from your dreams, and the objects that you remember  If your everyday life seems poor, don't blame it; blame yourself; admit to yourself that you are not enough of a poet to call forth its riches; because for the creator there is no poverty and no poor, indifferent place  And even if you found yourself in some prison, whose walls let in none of the world's sound - wouldn't you still have your childhood, that jewel beyond all price, that treasure house of memories  Turn your attention to it  Try to raise up the sunken feelings of this enormous past; your personality will grow stronger, your solitude will expand and become a place where you can live in the twilight, where the noise of other people passes by, far in the distance  And if out of this turning within, out of this immersion in your own world, poems come, then you will not think of asking anyone whether they are good or not  Nor will you try to interest magazines in these works: for you will see them as your dear natural possession, a piece of your life, a voice from it  A work of art is good if it has arisen out of necessity  That is the only way one can judge it  So, dear Sir, I can't give you any advice but this: to go into yourself and see how deep the place is from which your life flows; at its source you will find the answer to, the question of whether you must create  Accept that answer, just as it is given to you, without trying to interpret it  Perhaps you will discover that you are called to be an artist  Then take that destiny upon yourself, and bear it, its burden and its greatness, without ever asking what reward might come from outside  For the creator must be a world for himself and must find everything in himself and in Nature, to whom his whole life is devoted.But after this descent into yourself and into your solitude, perhaps you will have to renounce becoming a poet   Nevertheless, even then, this self searching that I ask of you will not have been for nothing  Your life will still find its own paths from there, and that they may be good, rich, and wide is what I wish for you, more than I can say.What else can I tell you  It seems to me that everything has its proper emphasis; and finally I want to add just one more bit of advice: to keep growing, silently and earnestly, through your whole development; you couldn't disturb it any more violently than by looking outside and waiting for outside answers to questions that only your innermost feeling, in your quietest hour, can perhaps answer.It was a pleasure for me to find in your letter the name of Professor Horacek; I have great reverence for that kind, learned man, and a gratitude that has lasted through the years  Will you please tell him how I feel; it is very good of him to still think of me, and I appreciate it.The poem that you entrusted me with, I am sending back to you  And I thank you once more for your questions and sincere trust, of which, by answering as honestly as I can, I have tried to make myself a little worthier than I, as a stranger, really am.Yours very truly,Rainer Maria RilkeAs a lit match first flickers in the hands Before it flames, and darts out from all sides Bright, twitching tongues, so, ringed by growing bands Of spectators—she, quivering, glowing stands Poised tensely for the dance—then forward glides And suddenly becomes a flaming torch.Her bright hair flames, her burning glances scorch,And with a daring art at her command Her whole robe blazes like a fire-brand From which is stretched each naked arm, awake,Gleaming and rattling like a frightened snake.And then, as though the fire fainter grows,She gathers up the flame—again it glows,As with proud gesture and imperious air She flings it to the earth; and it lies there Furiously flickering and crackling still—Then haughtily victorious, but with sweet Swift smile of greeting, she puts forth her will And stamps the flames out with her small firm feet Can we start this conversation over You are looking over my shoulder to impress someone tonight I'm dying from o-only listening to you And though I smile, it's just because I want to like you The truth is, I'm o-overwhelming you with lies and though I try There's no honesty in me tonight Can we start the introductions over You are looking over my shoulder to impress someone tonight I'm dying from o-only listening to you And though I'm quiet, I'll find my voice tonight I know that I can be cold sometimes There was snow on the ground when i was born And the stars didn't shine that night I know that I'm so cold sometimes Take me out, take me out and I'll melt, I'll melt All the way down Take me out and I'll melt all the way down Take me out, take me out and I'll melt, I'll meltCan you name all the bones in my body ?Can you make all the tones in my head What you couldn't find in books And you've broken every spine Is that I'll make I'll make you mine I'll make you mine Because I love you so tonight I promise that I will send my fears away I can tame all the tigers in your blood stream Can you lay all my ghosts in their place What you couldn't find in books And you've broken every spine Is that I'll make I'll make you mine I'll make I'll make you mine I'll make you mine Cause I love you so tonight I'll promise that I will send my fears awaySometimes Offer more than talking Say, I like you very much Say, what when cut grows over Pink and white Carnations Skinny daisies For each inch cut The roots grow ten Where we can't see them Devise A way of saving your words Say nothing If it's forced For each inch cut The roots grow ten Where we can't see them I'm laying in the soil Is it time for me to rise I've pulled up my stakes again Is there someone who can take me in I powered up Owned who I was Changed how I look Broke open love I fell enough I took offense Mangled my heart Broke open love Broken open love As darkness falls Into my arms So must you fall I'll take it all I fell enough On the defense Mangled my heart Broke open love I know, I know, I'm breaking down I don't wanna break down I know, I know, I'm losing out I don't wanna lose out I know, I know, I'm fucking up I don't wanna fuck up I know, I know, I'm losing out I know I'm breaking down Broke open love
