trails and leave the victims catching breath inside the smoke This the revival of that fiver rap Harlem city Epitomy of street survival rap Hard and gritty Allah's math with a swag they can't master cast from the plaster of the Elohim God is with me I spark fear in they hearts with 50,000 watts of light beams from out the deepest chasms of the darkness Each verse I leave my mark and they say they can't market it But these is gemstones, bezel cut lain in gold copper Language so proper, I enunciate the doctrine, taking converts you wonder why my name is so popular I came from a jungle made of concrete and conflict, liars and them tigers and them bears held us hostage Where I learned the difference tween authentic and imposters Where I turned my sentences to loaded guns and cocked em  there I stayed alone beware of sinisters and monsters Now I play in venues in the center of a mosh pit Huh  Im the center of your conscience The black dot, honey skin, the pinnacle of progress The future of music look brighter than a solar flare I'm blacker than garvey, you whiter than a polar bear Hold it there, you don't wanna salsa with the Holyfield Box the crowd and leave my mic like artifact- holy

Give it up for Sa-Roc Sa-Roc: Peace, peace, peace Tracy G: Does anyone try to pressure you into going into that stereotypical female character, just playing, like, a sex icon Sa-Roc: You know what's funny  I've never gotten that, cause I've established myself and who I am as an M C very early on  I'm the Goddess M C  Nobody's gonna ask me to disrespect myself and I won't Tracy G: Goddess M C!Sway Calloway: Yo, she just stunted on us with that, "I'm the Goddess M C"I'm black magic, 5 foot something, the rap maverick Y'all want me to dumb it down, well my shit too elaborate Alphabetic acrobatics on every apparatus Step onto my train of thought and get lost in my labyrinth I am not a Barbie I'm a barbarian Dismember bodies of work vocally then I bury em Prey for my opponents for they know not what they getting into It's too many snakes and froggy types in my terrarium Lyrically I'm Kali Ma, goddess of these arias Nowadays emcees can't walk a mile inside my Adidas, blood I will cripple every rhyme that you exhale from out your diaphragm Then diagram the steps to your retirement I'm Tigress, I earned every stripe that you admiring Never been a star, I am more inclined to be Orion And I'm liable to ionize your entire environment And that means everybody charged up when I'm reciting These 16s like W MDs, I'm public enemy to these Republican bastards asking For passwords to my ribonucleic acids, asterisk That means my genetic code for anybody askingOn January 17th 1961 I was beaten then tortured then murdered by guns The firing squad, The C IA, the Mi6, the Belgians were in on it Mubutu too tried to kill the cause by killing me silly see Because the flesh dies only to set the soul free And it landed in this M C manifest destiny but only for the Africans The salt of the earth the father of man they gave a cross then They took the land As long Belgians continued to mine Then I guess the D RC was fine No its not My body dip in acid All for greed and I just wanted them to leave The United Nations turned their backs while the Europeans cleansed the blacks The Soviet Union wanted to assist But the U SA just labeled me a communist Pan African, pro people, prolific against evil Whether it comes through war or peace Please remember my name - it's Patrice, LamumbaDropped from out the clouds, had to change form Flooded the plains, had 'em praying for my brainstorms I'm a master, pieced from divine Every work of art got a bitter mob trying to frame jawn I'm heir to an era of conflict Where the post codes drawn so the pros and the cons split Professionals been robbin' hoods with a palm flick Gave to the poor and the Black the stigmata of convict See, the cross we bear is too familiar Embedded in the home of the brave, the darkest of interiors Saw street scholars and soldiers defect'Cause they post-traumatic stressed from the American experience Go off then I'm finna go all in Murk every line came before this delivery, make orphans See, my heart bleed from the hardship in my origins My great grand sold for a band at Southern auctions It's the razor edge in my cadence that shredded through these paper trails Only alphabet boys I trust is N OI and Els Only alchemy justify the nuggets I expel Inner city idol trying to be the next Ida Wells, Roc I don't know what you might've heard But we ain't going nowhere but up Got a whole squad dressed in all black Got the streets on notice, what up They want us in the same place Ain't nobody ever gonna really change nothing but us Hello, this is revolution, get on upDear white people, I am not your

my newest seed is a future leader A testament of my evolution of excellence To be or not to be human, that's what the question is I'm still the answer regardless, rappers is movin' targets Acknowledge me as the smartest passenger movin' forward My little sister bars blast like Kalashnikov Just because, heavy bass, dance like Baryshnikov The sound pierce like bullets and swords From a nation under attack like bulletin boards And I'm reppin' the foundation to the fullest, of course Today, another life was lost and it could have been yours Whether in Colorado or Collie Park You but a mile apart from the sharpness of my remarks The Black oligarch makin' weaponry out of art My supplier Sol Messiah told me we gotta talk I walk through the dark Now do I roll deep or do I hold heat Now am I laid back or a control freak Rockin' a crown gilded in gold leaf I'm from a place where the people dream, but don't sleepIf I could get a taste of my freedom, I would savor every tidbit Pilot planes like I was Tuskegee The flyest letterman, call me collegiate That's why I get violent on these mics Can turn a phrase like Ike and Tina Stories bloodied and beaten so well, we're calling 'em red tales, how convenient, facts The struggle I know left physical scars as lasting proof Mommy and pops residual trauma pushed them to bottles, Absolut Homie, that '90s era was rocky, had to be sly and outfox the coop Everyone knows a rose can grow from cracks, but most don't blossom fruit So my lyrical watts like miracle drops, B B, I'm Posdnuos That's De La from the soul I'm undersold and over hip-hop to boot They worship green like God Got bands to ear like radio's top ten grooves My samples clear, I push gems like De Beers No conflict, just the truth See, I'm the plug I'm giving the people the power, try not to blow out the fuse I'm so close to these lower and upper cases that I guess that it's best I recuse Telling me I need to party and bullshit to win Well then, homie, I guess I'ma lose Ain't no biggie, I'm black obsidian Rap's new Gideon, summon the troops RocMy mic is like my only highlight in my life some days I testify in two 8s like saints on Sundays'Cause I been through the sewage and come back unfazed Now my music’s my temple of worship, so come praise Now let me reintroduce myself, I’m Sa-Roc They call me Red or shorty for short on my block Ain’t have no bread, fam kept me fed On Garvey and Gil Scott, so I’d keep a real shot Now I’m trigger happy, busting too often from my esophagus Offer my soul up in every re-verse from my consciousness See, D C made me but I’m bigger than a metropolis Super manifesting my lane from crib to sarcophagus I ain’t gon' lie, little recognition would be dope'Cause I be channeling just like a Panasonic remote The ghost of my past demanding to hide my every quote Until the truth saves my future just like a antidote Hand to God This ain’t never easy Hope that you believe me'Cause I don’t have a reason To ever tell a lie to you, rather say goodbye to you, baby This ain’t never easy Hope that you believe me'Cause I don’t have a reason To ever tell a lie to you, rather say goodbye to you, babyYou won’t ever see us back away Til we make the world see that we ain’t come to play This is so lil girls dream bigger than they supposed to And we get a fair share of pie on the plate I am her Pardon this interruption of your

up to anyone’s opinion on how I protect it I’m part of collectives from Mali to Mecca getting bigger And our premiere gon be major no longer hidden figures We out to level the playing field for them young queens Coming for that wage gap til we recoup them Hidden figures In ’97 million women marched and I was with it In 2017 the same the establishment livid If this a man’s world we came here to
