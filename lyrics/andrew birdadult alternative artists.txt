skeptic, there's a question that still hovers near For it begs the question How did I ever find you Now you got me writing love songs With a common refrain like this one here, baby And all your left

strand of hair You know someone's watching you watching me watching you And all that we look upon You may not know me but you feel my stare And if she sees you, it changes you Rearranges your molecules And if you see her, it changes her She's a danger now, after school And if she sees you, it changes you Rearranges your molecules And if you see her, it changes her She'll be seeing you

lightning rod History forgets the moderates For those who sit recalcitrant and taciturn You know I'd rather turn and burn than scale this edifice, yeah Where's my accomplice So take my hand, we'll do more than stand Take my hand, we'll claim this land Take my hand, and we'll let the rock rollUsed to have just one foot out the door Yeah, I always wanted more I always was the one You thought would

eyes for you Certain fads, stripes and plaids, some singles ads They run you hot and cold like a rheostat I mean a thermostat So you bite on a towel, hope it won't hurt too bad My dewy eyed Disney
