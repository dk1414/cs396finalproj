Drove the people away from their land A land full of beauty and wonder Was raped by the British brigands If you could keep voices like flowers There'd be shamrock all over the world If you could drink dreams like Irish streams Then the world would be high as the mountain of morn In the 'Pool they told us the story How the English divided the land Of the pain and the death and the glory And the poets of auld Ã‰ireland If we could make chains with the morning dew The world would be like Galway Bay Let's walk over rainbows like leprechauns The world would be one big Blarney stoneAngela, they put you in prison Angela, they shot down your man Angela, you're one of the millions Of political prisoners in the world Sister, there's the wind that never dies Sister, we're breathing together Sister, our loves and hopes forever keep On moving oh so slowly in the world They gave you sunshine They gave you sea They gave you everything but the jailhouse key They gave you coffee They gave you tea They gave you everything but equality Angela, can you hear the earth is turning Angela, the world watches you Angela, you soon will be returning To your sisters and brothers in the worldHappy
