I don't want to say I I just want to say we We'd make a great team And teamwork is good It's good enough for me And mediocrity is something I've been trying so hard lately to avoid By avoiding conversations that lead to confrontation While confronting my fears of life and failing hard While hardly making progress Progressing is a process I'm processing everything that I've been through so far Away, far away I've been so far away So far away Romance seems like a means to an end Maybe I don't need a lover, I just need the friend Who carried my weight when my back was sore I don't need a lover I don't need a lover I said, I don't need a lover I don't need a lover I said, I don't need a lover 'cause I don't need anyone And if I came back, would it be like back then Then we could get back to a place that's better than it has been Lately, I've been feeling like you might not like me Like I might be too late Like there might be other ladies in your limelight Limelight, limelight You'll get it when the time's right It's my life, my life, but romance takes the spotlight Lately, I've been feeling like I might not like me Like I might be too late Like it might be too late I'm too lateNot again Not again:]Listen close, listen in The wind is trying to talk to you To warn you that the warmth will be leaving While you're soundly sleeping it off You can try to speak You can try to move forward But your hands won't work on the rocks They'll slip Your grip has become toxic to progress:]And there's no time to climb If you don't let it go Coming around the mountain like an echo Spikes in, spokes up Grab your rope:]It's a test It's a risk You're always racing the clock You're never comfortable unless you're reaching the top I know you need this I know you need this Don't let your bloodstream thin and let the storm win There's a trick in your head to help continue the fight Don't let your thoughts run dry You've got to stay alive I know you need this A goal you can't miss What's the point of dedication without the risk I’m holding back my own hair now‘Cause you don’t even want to hold my hand I can’t change the person I was before I met you I can’t change where I’ve been But how could I have told you when you didn’t want to hear it And how can I tell you now if you don’t want to listen I wasn’t always the person that I am now But I worked so hard to get here And all I want is for you to hear me out Or am I singing to a crowd of new deaf ears I haven’t always been quite this innocent But I worked so hard to get here The road to recovery was a long one, in case you wanna know I was reduced to nothing but my shell While trying to find someone who would love the exterior Well, I subsequently destroyed my inner selfA stone house with brick walls And a good foundation should never fall But when you use dynamite for construction Better prepare for that grand eruption And if you're hoping the wind is blowing In a way that will keep your circuits cool Then you're the fool And all I could hear was an army of voices ringing in my ear And telling me, “The choice is gone There's no place to run”And all I could hear was you telling me, "I'm only Good with my back in a bed while you settle the score"With my face pushed to the floor And yeah, I should've known better But I, I swear it was better before Good face and a sweet tongue With the family swearing that he's the one But when you close off the doors and connections Isolation as his means of deception It's pretty easy keeping quiet When your mouth's held shut by someone else's violence And the only thing worse than the noise was silence'Cause then you never know what'll happen next If you're lucky, it's nothing If you're not, he’ll call it sex But that was just to make himself feel better Wasn't it  All I could see was a stranger in the mirror With blood on her lips and her mind giving into doubt“There's no way out of this”This is not, is not the voice I thought, I thought that I would have now And this is not the life I saw me developing for myself But I guess you can’t stay way up on that pedestal forever With your head so far in the clouds You’re bound to see bad weather Damn Honey, have you seen the view from up here ‘Cause I can see everything in front of me So clearly that I don’t want to go I don’t want to go back now I need to find a way to make this forever I need to find a way to make this forever I need to find a way to make this forever I need to find a way to make this work forever This is not, is not the girl I thought, I thought I was becoming‘Cause for the last three years I moved so slow I moved like molasses and called it running I called it running But I guess you dive in day to day or you’re dead on arrival And dear you’ve got to find the difference between life and survivalGet out of your mourning clothes You can’t stay in bed all day Even though I want to I know I said that I needed this But it seems good things must always slip away And as for the necessities that I buried in my bones They’re not that far away In a place that’s not my home I won’t forget how we always said that we needed this And I know that I always promised That through thick and thin we would remain friends And in spite of this, you know I never meant to be dishonest When I was swimming in those dark waters You pulled me from that lake I swear you meant the world to me Even when I made such an awful mess of things So now comes the consequence that I know we both must face And just because something is just Doesn’t mean that it feels fair I won’t forget how we always said that we needed this I know that I always promised That through thick and thin we would remain friends And in spite of this, you know I never meant to be dishonestCall all those you left out in the cold They won't be back soon Place your bets, that you'll end up alone Just like you've always asked to They don't react well, when you tell them what you crave You want friends  Friends that live in houses, not graves You were a wreck, and they wouldn't let you in Cause you were a dirty mess And they don’t want it on their carpet So you felt like a bug, that everyone wanted to squish But you wouldn't give this up No, you won't give this up Call the bluff, that you've been hanging off of –You can't hold on forever This cliff hanger is you over the edge You're falling off soon You were a wreck, and they wouldn't let you in Cause you were a dirty mess And they don’t want it on their carpet So you felt like a bug, that everyone wanted to squish But you wouldn't give this up No, you won't give this upAnd I'm not trying to keep bringing this up My stupid brain it starts and it won't shut up And I'm not trying to hash this out again Or harp over my hesitations And I'm afraid if I start saying what's on my mind My security blanket will unravel with time So please don't pull this thread I try to see it from your perspective But respectively I I think you're missing the point From your perspective Bet you expected For all of this to fall under the rug I bet you never really thought I'd tug at it What you projected A calm swift exit Everybody says that ignorance is bliss But I don't think that applies to thisI fell asleep on the wrong night Driving down a coast line Running from a love I never wanted to fight Sick of sleeping by myself As the biplanes by my house took off I guess I decided to try It's like my teeth fell out My hair grew in reverse So now my smile's gone And my words are over rehearsed Every single strand You ran your hands through Has blown away with the wind Like every trace of you I started thinking of past times And how in the past I've Let my emotions get the best of me All my hand under details Before my mind derailed And the moon pulled me out to the sea It's like the waves came in and washed over my feet And I was finally content And I could finally breathe ??Now I've got all that I need Hell, we were so close and you never evenCan we talk about your heart please It must be so damn exhausting Always seeing the worst in everybody Including me Can we discuss this condition Your negative disposition To anybody that isn't you I am not a terrible person Like you tend to think I am For some God-awful reason Can we talk about your heart now It must be so debilitating how You save so much room for so much disdain To me it just seems like-Everyone else is always the worst But now self-reflection proves difficult Before anyone speaks, you think you know what they think What an incrediblе feat, to be forevеr in sync With the over-analytical, hyper self-critical Mind of metaphysical, optimistic cynical people I am not a terrible person Like you tend to think I am For some God-awful reason I would laugh, but I woke up crying I would laugh, but I woke up crying You tell me to laugh but I woke up crying
