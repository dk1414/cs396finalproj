Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb In the shape of an "L" on her forehead Well, the years start comin' and they don't stop comin'Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'Didn't make sense not to live for fun Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb So much to do, so much to see So what's wrong with taking the backstreets You'll never know if you don't go You'll never shine if you don't glow Hey now, you're an all star Get your game on, go play Hey now, you're a rock star Get the show on, get paid Only shootin' stars break the mold It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older But the meteor men beg to differ Judging by the hole in the satellite picture The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin The water's gettin' warm so you might as well swim My world's on fire, how 'bout yours That's the way I like it and I'll never get boredIt ain't no joke, I'd like to buy the world a toke And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars Hey, I know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe This is a love attack, I know it went out but it's back It's just like any fad, it retracts before impact And just like fashion it's a passion for the with-it and hip If you got the goods they'll come and buy it Just to stay in the clique So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow But if the offer's shunned You might as well be walking on the sun Twenty-five years ago they spoke out and they broke out Of recession and oppression and together they toked And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire Just singing and clapping, man, what the hell happened Then some were spellbound some were hell-bound, some they fell down And some got back up and fought back against the meltdown And their kids were hippie chicks, all hypocrites Because fashion is smashing the true meaning of itI thought love was only true in fairy tales Meant for someone else but not for me Love was out to get me That's the way it seemed Disappointment haunted all my dreams And then I saw her face Now I'm a believer And not a trace Of doubt in my mind I'm in love, I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I tried I thought love was more or less a given thing More I gave the less I got, oh yeah What's the use in trying All you get is pain When I wanted sunshine, I got rain And then I saw her face Now I'm a believer And not a trace Of doubt in my mind I'm in love, I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I triedWhy can't we be friends Why can't we be friends Why can't we be friends

at yourself Don't worry 'bout it, you look fine How'd you get your hair so tight You can't get laid, you might as well fight It's February and you got a tan I gotta hand it to you, man You're the bull of the ball You try to stand tall Thinking you can take 'em all Sorry about your penis Sorry about your penis Sorry about your penis Caught you looking at yourself I bet you've got overhead cams Personalized plates and all Your truck is probably twenty feet tall I bet you say, "Dude" a lot I bet you don't do it at all And all this anger's building up You might as well fuck a guy up Sorry

are the antibody Mind, soul and zen And the world's a stage And the end is near So push rewind, just in time Thank anybody You're gonna do it again The way that you walk It's just the way that you talk Like it ain't no thing And every single day is just a fling Then the morning comesI can't get enough of you, baby I can't get enough of you, baby Yes, it's true Baby, yes, it's true Whenever we

get enough of you baby Right or wrong Baby, right or wrong When you had to go I hated the thought I always wish the night was twice as longWalking out of the door, I'm on my way Can you tell me just where I'm going Occupational skills would you give me a clue What to do 'cause my mind's in motion Just trying to relax, I find myself on the couch With big plans but there's always tomorrow Is something wrong with me Or the way that I'm thinking Come on, come on and tell me why you're staring Come on, come on it must be what I'm wearing Come on, come on and tell me Why's it taking so long for you to recognize and stop Another day in the sun I'm having fun Feel the heat sneaking up on me I take a look in the sky a plane goes by Is that the reason that I can't breathe I take a look and I wonder why Why these birds don't fly It's hard for me to see and I believe Oh my, oh myI used to get mad at my school The teachers who taught me weren't cool You're holding me down Turnin' around Feeling me up with your rules I've got to admit, its getting better A little better all the time I have to admit, its getting better A little better since you've been mine Me used to be an angry young man Me hiding my head in the sand You gave me the word I finally heard I'm doing the best that I can I've got to admit, its getting better A little better all the time I have to admit, its getting better It's getting better since you've been mineLife imitates the game of chess You can be the rook or the pawn But if you have the strategy that's best You can be the king, or in this case, the don It's easy to get knocked out of the game Depending on which way you want to play You've got to have eyes in the back of your head Now that we have that out of the way Rev up the Lincoln and let's get to drinking some caffeine-o Let's go to Nicoletti's 'cause he makes a mean spaghetti sauce I'm a connoisseur of the finer things in life I'll take any flick with Al Pacino I'm a man of respect and I prefer to be addressed as padrino If you're the type that likes to spill the beans You could be a stone in someone's shoe You'll receive a kiss on each cheek And then you'll know that pretty soon, the stone will be removed Everyone knows that crime doesn't pay It doesn't pay the taxes anyway You've got to be slick if you don't want to stick Now that we have that out of the way
