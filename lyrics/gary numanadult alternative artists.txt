Here in my car I feel safest of all I can lock all my doors It's the only way to live In cars Here in my car I can only receive I can listen to you It keeps me stable for days In cars Here in my car Where the image breaks down Will you visit me please If I open my door In cars Here in my car I know I've started to think About leaving tonight Although nothing seems right In carsWhen they called me broken, I knew When they called me evil, I knew When they called me Ruin, I knew I would always find my way to you When I begged forgiveness, they knew When I begged for mercy, they knew When I begged for nothing, they knew I would always find my way to you My name is Ruin, my name is vengeance My name is no one, and no one is calling My name is Ruin, my name is heartbreak My name is lonely, my sorrow's a darkness My name is Ruin, my name is evil My name's a war song, I sing you a new one My name is ruin, my name is broken My name is shameless, I'll tear your world openAnd M.E., I eat dust We're all so run down I'd call it my death But I'll only fade away And I hate to fade alone Now there's only M.E We were so sure We were so wrong Now it's over But there's no one left to see And there's no one left to die There's only M.E Why should I care Why should I try Oh no, oh no I turned off the pain Like I turned off you all Now there's only M.EWe live in a windswept hell Where dust and death are neighbours We hide in a perfect storm Not even God remembers We ran from the wars of man From everything you are and would be We are invisible We are the dead Ghost Nation When the sky came down When the sun went dark When the night was torn And we heard God laugh When The Righteous came And they cleansed our sins Have you ever seen death With your own eyes We live in The Great Unfound Where thought and ghost still wander We drift on drifting sand Where horrors of our past still lingerWe're in the building where they make us grow And I'm frightened by the liquid engineers Like you My Mallory heart is sure to fail I could crawl around the floor just like I'm real Like you The sound of metal I want to be you I could learn to be a man Like you Plug me in And turn me on Oh, everything is moving I need my treatment, it's tomorrow they send me Singing, "I am an American"Do you Picture this, if I could make the change I'd love to pull the wires from the wall Did you And who are you  And how can I try Here inside, I like metal Don't you All I know Is no one dies I'm still confusing love with needI'm waiting in the dark Waiting for a dark light To show me the way I'm hiding from the world Trapped by my ambition Drowning in my fear You're welcome to stand in my place You're welcome to feel what I feel You're welcome to live my life You're welcome to sleep in my bed of thorns I'm walking through the dust Pulling out splinters Of things that never last I'm easily forgotten There is always someone Better than the pastI could listen to you scream Pretty music to my ears I could listen to it all day If you want me to I could talk about my world How you brought about ruin I could talk about your greed If you want me to I could look into evil See a heart just like mine I could throw away reason If you want me to I could walk into darkness Find the hole you crawled in to I will be the intruder If you want me to You can whisper your Lord's Prayer And pretend that it matters But don't you wish you'd just listened more You can hide in the shadows And pretend I won't find you But don't you wish you'd just listened more I could listen to more lies About promises you kept Will you walk on water Like you said you would I could make you my prisoner But you were dead men talking When you burned the oceans Like you said you wouldWe were dust in a world Of grim obsession We were torn from our Life of isolation We were pulled from the path Of least resistance And the songs we sang What became of us We're here waiting for you We're here waiting for you We are yours We're waiting for you We are yours We're waiting for you We all pray for the end For the god to take us We were falling down One by oneHere in my car I feel safest of all I can lock all my doors It's the only way to live In cars Here in my car I can only receive I can listen to you It keeps me stable for days In cars Here in my car Where the image breaks down Will you visit me please If I open my door In cars Here in my car I know I've started to think About leaving tonight Although nothing seems right In carsWhen they called me broken, I knew When they called me evil, I knew When they called me Ruin, I knew I would always find my way to you When I begged forgiveness, they knew When I begged for mercy, they knew When I begged for nothing, they knew I would always find my way to you My name is Ruin, my name is vengeance My name is no one, and no one is calling My name is Ruin, my name is heartbreak My name is lonely, my sorrow's a darkness My name is Ruin, my name is evil My name's a war song, I sing you a new one My name is ruin, my name is broken My name is shameless, I'll tear your world open
