Na x37 One, two, one, two, three, four!I think there's something, it's hidden deep inside Am I breathing or am I buried alive And I can feel it, the fear that cuts like a knife I pray that no one can see from the inside Voices in my head whisper that I'm okay People all around me tell me I'm so strange I can't tell the difference of the light and the dark Hold me closer dear when I'm falling apart I'm crazy, baby Please medicate me till I lose my head I'm crazy, baby I'm the Jekyll and Hyde Crazy in your eyes tonight It's closing in on me, it's in the air I breathe That silent little voice that lies behind my teeth It's in the pictures I take, the memories I erase If I were you and you were me, what would you say I swore that I'd always love you And your sweet smile and the scent of your hair But your flare has gone away for awhile Take me to the edge of town to To sort this whole thing out To sort this whole thing out I get lost in your eyes and the glow of the fireflies Lets run away, together we stay Forever in your arms, I crumble And now my dream continues So real as you push your hand into mine To let me know it's alright We walk in hand out of the sunlight Hear the clock strike twelve I'm waiting for your whisper Before the last petal hits the groundFeel the wind beneath your feet I don't care to see you leave What you're in for now beats jealousy I'm gone from this wretched place Just another face In and out of my head Scars run down your arms To make you feel like something I'm so lonely and it's killing me It's tearing me apart Life is just a game Says the lady with gold drops filling her hands Life is just a war Says the kid who cannot take anymore Show me paradise where waters fall and fires fly I can't believe my eyes You're falling over the times you lied Wait for reality I won't stand and watch you bleed What you're in for now beats death it seems Keep me alive, I crave the envy And the rush that caves the emptyThey say love is magic They say it's always there But I can show you a magic trick I can show you how to disappear Dance with me, it's just a feeling and I'm over it I'm a dance you won't forget I hope you feel the side effects of a long lost lover The games not over until you fall from your Mountaintop of past regrets Hanging by your fingertips Sit down and wait for further instructions We aren't going anywhere But thanks for a good time Feel what you want today I'm here for you now, but I won't stay Time isn't on our side, but we're turning heads tonight You make me crazy, girl But not enough for me to say I'll let you hold my heart I'll let you in for a tasteTangled in a web of reversed lives And my reflection is the one that's on my side Now lies the choice between regret and time Belief is fading and I can't ignore your signs So close your eyes and wish I'd mock the weak Ones who live in fear, avoiding what they need I'll dream, while you're stuck underneath I am something you're not I don't like to brag but I'm the one who outset your sun I am something you're not You don't understand that your pride has left you undone Weakness, what's your weakness It's the one thing you love most Your biggest fear is when you look in the mirror Weakness, what's your weakness What's your weakness  What's your weakness You are something I'm not I don't like to brag but I'm the one who outset your sun You are something I'm not You don't understand that your pride has left you undoneBurn out the night Burn out the night Burn out the night Burn out while the night is young Come inside, welcome to the show With hollow eyes Chest with empty holes You never know So come inside, just come inside So don't embrace me, never take me, don't take me alive So come inside, just come inside You can't remake me, never fake me, don't take me tonight Lean in closer, I hear you whisper Burn out the night Burn out the night Burn out the night Taste the poison on your tongue Burn out the night Burn out the night Burn out the night Burn out while the night is youngNa x37 One, two, one, two, three, four!I think there's something, it's hidden deep inside Am I breathing or am I buried alive And I can feel it, the fear that
