Up and down like a red rubber ball You're always back and forth like the clock on the wall I want to know about you I'm spinning all around you If I stay, do you think that we could change your routine I know a trick, I've always got a few up my sleeve This life is controlled confusion It's just a grand illusion And you ask me"How do you feel when you're away "And you ask me"How do you pass the days "Sing along to a song that I know It goes bah-bah-bada, sing it over and over Let it hypnotize you I'm still here right beside you Hold my hand, you can follow my lead You're like a ballerina twirling 'round on your feet And watching is so fantastic I want to ask you Would you come here and spin with me I've been dying to get you dizzy Find a way up into your head So I can make you feel like new again Would you come here and spin with me I've been dying to get you dizzy Find a way up into your head So I can make you feel like new again Now collapse, take delight in the fall and catch your breath I know you feel the ring from it all So try and collect yourself now It's just a euphoric comedown And you asked me"How do you feel when you're away "And you asked me"How do you pass the days "'Cause I can still remember when you were afraid of the dark And I told you to come And you followed where I asked you to go You'd goI found a picture that we took when we brought in the new year It's hard to see, but I remember You wore a cocktail dress, ignored the goosebumps on your neck The namesake of your outfit to keep you warm You always said that every thought I had was geometric I couldn't think outside my own lines I hope you're alright love, I'm sorry that I wasted your time Never had the intention to make you go Ooh oh-oh oh To make you go To make you go, to make you go I never wanted to make you go You might be a stranger now And I just wanted to let you know That I meant what I said And every dream I've ever had has been of myself And every dream I've ever had's been of a Better view with a ten-month summer Losing you is like cutting my fingers off And even with that summer Without you, I'd rather cut my fingers offI hear you've been telling all your friends that you're done with me Like you always knew things wouldn't work out And I've been hearing things from people that I don't want to talk to Like it matters who you're sleeping with now Can I erase from my mind anything that you said Or any time that we spent with each other I don't want to waste away another cell on a memory When you're just another meaningless lover Forget the nights that we spent laughing'Til the morning on your bedroom floor Without a thought about your roommate asleep down the hall Forget the days we'd waste in bed Tangled, the smoke still on your breath Undressed, and pinning you up to the wall And I swore I heard you talking when I was tossing in my sleep You were always trying to walk in circles around me I was out one night when I saw you, and you froze me where I stood I would hate you, I would hate you if I could Forget the nights that we spent laughing'Til the morning on your bedroom floor Without a thought about your roommate asleep down the hall Forget the days we'd waste in bed Tangled, the smoke still on your breath Undressed, and pinning you up to the wallCarelessly you pass the hours Humming songs you heard when you were young Positively unattached Naïve and unattracted to the buzz Elated with your lack of interest What a wonderful and different song Show me why you're always smiling Laugh again and make me fall in love Oh, just take me where you go When it gets dark, without you I won't make it out I don't think I'll make it out alive I wanna run and hide With you tonight, I know that I can make it out With you I know I'll make it out alive Let me know your secret Tell me how you color all the empty space Drawn outside the lines Your world's a vibrant illustration you create Chasing you, I'm falling through the rabbit hole Deep down into an old slope Evenly, you're pulling me ever faster as we go Spinning out of controlCan I stay at home  I don’t want to go I don’t want to wake up 'til the sun is hanging low Stay up through the night, sleep away the light Just another dream I had that's better than my life Adolescent dreams gave to adult screams Paranoid that I won’t have all the things they say I need What if I don’t want a pattern on my lawn All I know is something's wrong, because every day, I'm Craving that new scream Lusting for more than just old dreams I’ve been dying to feel alive And I’ve been wasting all my time Chasing the high Can I reset my brain  If not, I’ll go insane I swear to God that I don’t think I can go another day Am I the only one  Is this in all of us I hate the thought that I’m alone, but I hope that you're not Craving that new scream Lusting for more than just old dreams I’ve been dying to feel alive And I’ve been wasting all my time Chasing the highI know you're probably sick Of always sorting me out It's like I've always got the taste Of orange nails in my mouth I know you've probably been exhausted Cause I haven't slept a wink in a week Your father doesn't like me Cause I'm not into sports And your mother won't approve Because I'm not of the cross I took an upper before your sister's wedding Just to help me pretend And I don't know what I need I don't know if I'll be there for you Down on your knees I don't know if I'll be there for you I know you always feel you're by yourself in the house This is the only night this week I haven't slept on the couch I hope you know it breaks my heart That I'm the reason for your sleeping alone Cause it was always a dream just to know you Sometimes I find I can hardly speak your name I know one day I'll come home and I'll find you It's just a matter of time 'til you break from the strainThinner at the waist line I feel thinner at the waist line I'm getting old in the face Everyday there’s another new line, new line Thinner at the waist line I feel thinner at the waist line I'm getting old in the face Everyday there’s another new line You're looking thinner, are you alright Yeah I'm just busy all of the time I'm just a little more tired Every day I really don't know why There's really nothing like the first time There's really nothing like the first time It's a long way down when you fall And you're missing cloud nine I wish I was more afraid I made all the same mistakes they told me I'd make And now it's different everyday They make me, they break meIt's the worst in the summer Those happy songs on the radio And all the pretty girls and perfect weather All make me want to know who really cares Cut my brain into hemispheres I want to smash my face until it's nothing but ears I want to paint my drain with a little red stain tonight Take my head cause it's what I want I want to fall asleep with the T V on And let the house burn down until it's gone with me inside Rest my head just a little longer I don’t care what time it is And I don’t want to have to feel so badly For all the things I said and never did Cut my brain into hemispheres I want to smash my face until it's nothing but ears I want to paint my drain with a little red stain tonight Take my head cause it's what I want I want to fall asleep with the T V on And let the house burn down until it's gone with me insideOn the last weekend before the fall Down at the beach carnival Spinning slowly with the carousel Your gold hoop earrings go so well With the little yellow light Shining on a foggy day Painting you a pretty shade Like you were a girl in a watercolor I could try but I can't explain How I do, I just know it Something supernatural And I'm feeling super natural I don't know how but I can say That I found my religion When nothing was ahead of us That week in California Hold on, won't the water be too cold Out of your mind and you're still so photogenic I like the lighting on you right at sun down We've talked too much to ever go back to the way it wasThree sixteen's of an inch Disappear right behind your lips We were waiting and watching the light in the sky And it hurt my eyes I guess that it must have been then We slipped out of our cagey heads and got Tangled and lost and dove further out into it all again And I was afraid But you were glowing like the most relieving light You were my revealing light I closed my eyes and suddenly we were attached You stayed with me after the moment passed I felt you buried deep under my chest Like my lungs when I'm breathing in And I was not myself when I opened up my eyes again Over our heads in a daze We sat and watched while the setting changed into Something I read in a book that I loved when I was young I fixed my stare to the screen A show with a monster was on the T VIt was early October, and all of the yards were alive with lights
