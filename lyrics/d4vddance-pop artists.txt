Watch the sunrise along the coast As we're both getting old I can't describe what I'm feeling And all I know is we're going home So, please don't let me go Don't let me go And if it's right, I don't care how long it takes As long as I'm with you, I've got a smile on my face Save your tears, it'll be okay All I know is you're here with me Ooh-ooh, oh, oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Watch the sunrise as we're getting old, oh-oh I can't describe, oh-oh I wish I could live through every memory again Just one more time before we float off in the wind And all the time we spent waiting for the light to take us in Have been the greatest moments of my lifeI'm scared It feels like you don't care Enlighten me, my dear  Why am I still here  Mm I don't mean to be Complacent with the decisions you made But why  Mm In the back of my mind You died And I didn't even cry No, not a single tear And I'm sick of waiting patiently For someone that won't even arrive Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh In the back of my mind I killed you And I didn't even regret it I can't believe I said it But it's true I hate youI’m scared It feels like you don’t care Enlighten me, my dear Why am I still here, oh I don’t mean to be complacent With the decision you made, but why In the back of my mind You died And I didn't even cry, no Not a single tear And I'm sick of waiting patiently For someone that won't even arrive In the back of my mind I killed you And I didn’t even regret it I can’t believe I said it But it’s true I hate youI dream about you and I But why do I even try Cause you're running away, running away And I'm trying to stay, trying to stay But what I'm trying to say is that I've been okay but without you Feel like I'm trapped in a maze We’re going our separate ways and I'm without you I dream about you and I But why do I even try Cause you're running away, running away And I'm trying to stay, trying to stay I dream about you and I But why do I even try Cause you're running away, running away And I'm trying to stay, trying to stay Different options and different paths I hope that your happy I hope it lasts Let’s hope we can leave everything in the past Times are changing and my time you're wasting while you'rе here You're nеver near me you act like you fear me Now it’s clearDo you think about me every night Before you go to sleep I know you must be terrified Of what you might see in your dreams, but I'm here for you still And even if you don't think that I'm near I'll still be right next to you, my dear And the way you make me feel Has the power to make the whole world stand still Who's to say that our love ain't real  And I know I'm not the perfect guy But I think I'm doing just alright It doesn't matter what you thought of me then But what you think of me now We haven't always seen eye to eye But right now, won't you look at minе Don't be scared, therе's no such thing as fear When you sleep, just know that I'm here for you still And even if you don't think that I'm near I'll still be right next to you, my dear And the way you make me feel Has the power to make the whole world stand still Who's to say that our love ain't real Hello, are you there 'Cause I missed you at the show tonight Anytime, anywhere, I just want to make sure you're alright If you're off with someone better Then I won't fault you What can I do but complain about us Times were better, but it seems minute The grand scheme of things never seemed to like us We never fit in the same frame The pictures always cut me out The right love, but in the wrong time frame Heart too small, you had to push me out Hello, I'm still here, and I'm holding my tears in my hands And if you were gonna walk away The least you could have done was say in advance"I'm leaving you"Heartless woman, time-consuming, headache-inducing whore That's all that you are, that's all you ever were I'm sorry for bruising you up with my words But you did the same not too long ago How does it feel to have your heart in your throat And biting the flesh How does it taste I still remember the kisses you gave To a broken boy Drown out the noise Everything that you once had in your voice Is no longer there, trapped in the void Of everything that we once tried to destroyDays go by so rapidly Oh, won't you comfort me I know what we had It was make believe, oh A placebo I can’t take a loss like that again I'd rather float off in the wind But maybe this is how it's supposed to be I guess we’ll see on the other side Where the grass seems to be greener On the other side Where my ribcage could be cleaner On the other side Where the light will not go out Oh, on the other side Thе other side Take my timе Please stop rushing me for company I can't figure it out I need you here, but you're not near I can't, I can't I can't, I can't Remember what was a dream or a memory Love isn't real Not to me, not to meLate in the afternoon I watched you as you leave You said you'll be back soon You've got blood on your sleeves The pieces you cut from me I bleed out The pain and suffering I'll take now I look into your eyes and I can see right through your lies And it's a terrible disguise I think we both know who dies here Too much on your mind The truth is what you hope to find But you can't leave the past behind You're the only one that lies here Late in the afternoon I thought I saw you leave But you're still next to me The blood stains on your sleeve Stay away from me I won't be deceivedSittin' on the bleachers alone Wonderin’ where it went wrong The ringin' of bells and the sound of the tone I haven't heard it in years Walkin’ in the rain past your home Feet soakin' wet, four missed calls on your phone Light in the window of where I belong, but I see two shadows up there So, this is how it feels To fall in love with you To always think of you To always dream of you Yes it hurts so much to fall in love with Sorry for leaving like that You don't deserve to get caught in my mess Loving you is just so difficult I don't know how I should tell you that I've fallen for somebody еlse Happened so quickly I lost mysеlf A shadow of you drifts along by my window Or did I imagine that Over water, there's a bridge, and I can't seem to get to you The fear of a loss, what I always succumb to The way, that I feel, I can't capture it all Like the waves that I sink in, when you tell me that I'm not Enough, shut up, 'cause I'd kill myself for you Walk in the dark, I can't find my way to you Gone, gave it all, and it's all my fault That I chose to keep holdin' on to the love you threw away But I'd stay, just to see you make it I'm stuck in my ways, oh, you know I'm not fakin'You thought I was simple so you got complicated Don't you get complicated, that's the reason that we separate The water rising faster, now before and after Climbin' up the laddеr, screamin' at me louder To lеt it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, ah-oh To let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, ah-oh Over water, there's a bridge, and I can't seem to get to you The fear of a loss, what I always succumb to The way, that I feel, I can't capture it all Like the waves that I sink in, when you tell me that I'm not
