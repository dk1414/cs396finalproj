I learned that you could choose why you hurt Or you can let the world hurt you while you do nothing The moment of that decision will change everything I realized my heart was a stranger to me When someone ripped it open And showed me parts that I’ve never seen And the past will pace back and forth Waiting for me to fall asleep And haunt me in my dreams Take me back to a place we used to be What if the real victory is knowing that We will not make the same mistakes again Show them again and again who I am What if the real victory is knowing that We won’t make the same mistakes again What if there’s no victory at all I’m caught in the crossfire of my God and my mistakes Is there more to learn if this is all that I can take Clever words are no escape Feelings shouldn’t be written in vain My God…I have no alibi I live beneath these northern lights We celebrate on autumn nights With the cement beneath our feet Brings our adviceWhere are you tonight I couldn't say goodbye Your words still echo in my mind The stars fall down lighting up the sky If I had one more chance I would have done it right The sky falls down at your command The city will roar with the sound of terror And our world will crumble At the sound of your voice So take my words, it's not my choice There's no looking back Live for right now I'm so far away, so far away With no difference between right or wrong I'm so far away, so far from you The sky falls down With a single glance From your eyes We walk as strangers in these times All of what we know is about to end We'll keep on fighting, but we'll never win There's no looking back Live for right now I'm so far away, so far away With no difference between right or wrong I'm so far away, so far from youI don't really know just where to start It's harder when we're standing miles apart If I could dream I'd paint a scene But there is too much noise When I can't sleep I need to hear your voice Would you sing to me Would you sing to me'Cause I can feel a part of me starting to break And when you are away from me it's harder to breathe I don't really know just where you are It's harder when I'm here and I'm all alone If I could sleep, it's you and me This distance keeps me up Come set me free I need to feel your touch Would you sing to me Would you sing to me'Cause I can feel a part of me starting to break And when you are away from me it's harder to breathe Would you sing to me Would you sing to me'Cause I can feel a part of me starting to break And when you are away from me it's harder to breatheIn the deepest parts Of the human heart that's where I play A piece of art and when I'm done Well I can't be held responsible Take a look at me now Standing oh so tall and proud When you know that inside I must be feeling miserable Take a look At me now Turn around before you forget your way out Take yourself Far away Take yourself Far from me And go to sleep with the lights on I'm the charm you need But I always leave You just don't know what to believe I've always got all my mistakes Right there in front of me It's in everything Oh you don't believe Well then take a look at me Watch me grind words through my teeth As I try to sing in keyDark spots that have broken down An annual Calvary clover On this day I can finally say I am defeated I watch the clouds disintegrate In front of me, everyday I tell them not to go so soon And I need you And I know You need me too God, I hope do It's too late Too late to turn back But my stomach tells me Something else is waiting Where the forests don't seem to hide I know its complicating Its something that you get with time And I'll never see you againThis time maybe this time Maybe this time they’ll all know my name This time after all of this time After this time things won’t be the same And I’m sure you won’t understand And my friends are the ones always being dishonest So I just learn ways to go on living without them They tell me over, over, and over They want closer and closer I’m leaving soon I offered what was left of me And I know the things they say Give me real or make me feel Give me real or make me…The positive and the negative of being alone When words are spoken Where will you be And when I’m down and broken Where will you be If I reach my hand for you Where will you be I’ll find you hidden in old photographyI never thought the day would come When we'd have to say goodbye But now the time has come As I wipe the tears from my eyes Too tired of these lonely nights I've lost everything That meant anything You're still ringing in my ears And in my dreams I've tried running but I can't Escape from you in my memories It's what kills me slowly You kill me slowly with the way I know you won't come back And I regret everything I said The city is so cold tonight It's exactly what I feel inside I only wish I could ask for One more chance It's what kills me slowly You kill me slowly with the way I know you won't come back And I regret everything I saidIf for the rest of your life You decide to never think about me Don’t expect me to care Drawing pictures on the walls all crazy Picked you up off the ground when you were down Don’t you forget it…I think you keep forgetting So it’s over I said it’s done I said there will not ever be another one Now let’s be honest I don’t deserve this So I’m focused in the Midwest Getting back to where we built this I’ve replaced everyone that I hate With everything I love No, I won’t blink twice at the mention of your name No, I’m not calling you out This is me showing I’m not messing around I’ll wave as you sink lower and lower and lower Is this still everything you want Then watch me go and get it This is something you won’t see But you’ve given me a reason to leave you behindI woke up next to her Felt a warm rush go through my body Gasping for air With her heart out of chest in my hands, all bloody She said thanks for taking me to a place i’ve never been Where i feel oh so comfortable It’s that when i’m feeling numb I forget the place i’m from Misguided misfortune, seeking pay in attention You're so comfortable You're so comfortable We all know that oh, you’ve got nothing to say And all you do is talk Tell me the last time you loved anything Can you love anything Is there someone out there to take me away I can’t keep living what you want me to be Well who am i Who am i today This is who i am What gets my heart beating After all - you're just a feeling And i swear one of these days Yea, that i'll just run away And go oh so far from here I’ll run imaginary lines, on my imaginative climb Undivided pretension, lost in loving intentionI can't Seem to crawl away I'm lost and so ashamed Careless but so afraid My life is fading Every day's another test Of fighting my addictions Placing myself in situations Will it ever go away Situations Will it ever go away Situations I used to never dream but now I only have nightmares Will you save me from this darkness Keep me surrounded I hear you calling me I need to feel you To end my agony and wash it all away Let me feel you Reaching for me I need to be I need to be surrounded by you Will it ever go away  Situations Will it ever go away  Situations
