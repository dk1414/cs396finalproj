I know you left me standing there Out of the calm of the coldest air I don't believe the words you said But I can't find the words I want Oh, I can't find the words I want If you were gone in another life I don't believe I would just survive I could feel you next to me An escape from the world I'm in Oh, I'm afraid of the world I'm in One day I will see Heaven's reach I'll find the one who left me sleeping Every war was another seed That could feed every soul in need Oh, I'm worn by the war in me Somebody found me here Somebody held my breath Somebody saved me from the world you left If you're gonna cry my tears If you're gonna hold my breath If you're gonna let me see the sun you set Oh, I am lost and found Oh, I am lost and foundYou could be my white knight And I could be your fairy tale And you could come and save me But that is not the end I will wear a white dress You will paint a sunset Life will be a love fest That’s how it all begins Say say, oh playmate Come out and play with me And bring your dollies three Climb up my apple tree Slide down my rainbow Into my cellar door And we’ll be jolly friends Forever more But the world can spin so madly And love can hurt so badly And stories end so sadly But this is not the end You still have my heartache I still have your sweater Things they will be better Oh no, but not todayMy mind is like a heavy hand Always making more of what really happened Critical imagination always working over time Maybe this is what the world will see A tiny little version of the tallest tree An optical illusion of the human mind Posing as a real life I never have my mind made up Before the bomb dropped And if i ever do decided to take a chance Oh, the part that keeps me holding on It'll be my mind Awaken my mind Awaken my mind Open my eyes Free my mind Awaken my mind Awaken my mind Open my eyes We like to watch the world go by Paint pretty picture with the perfect light Build a happy home to live inside Work until the sunriseWe used to paint petals in the sky Jump around on trampolines and never go inside We'd wake up in the morning and decide What we would do for the rest of our lives But the rest of our lives came quickly Oh my darlin'Oh my dear Times is hard without you here Oh my darlin'Oh my babe How long will it take To be carried away To go back to the younger days I wonder if you're wandering outside Still tracing with your fingers all the colors in the sky I'm looking out my window for a clue Leaving a sign and hoping it finds you I found you Oh my darlin'Oh my dear Times is hard without you here Oh my darlin'Oh my babe How long will it take To be carried away To go back to the younger daysLook up You see the sky on fire Look out The world is getting higher, now Believe, that you can change the world Your dreams, have been living in a cone of silence So let them out Find your voice, find your voice Make a noise You try, to find the words you want to say You might, be looking much too far away To recognize, we’re all disguised Find your voice, find your voice Make a noise Oh, we’re all aboard before the war, worlds collide Look at all the people fighting for the same side We’re all aboard before the war, worlds collide You can’t have the peace you’re looking for without a fight Oh, we’re all aboard before the war, worlds collide Look at all the people fighting for the same sideOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh Hmm, mmm, hmm Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh Can't get out, can't get out, can't get out So beautiful, so elegant So lovely, oh, so lovely So dignified, so hard to find So rare, so fine, so chic Oh, you're still the same, girl you're still the same You've got a first class ticket to the top And everybody's talking how they watching how you play You're a world-class vision;
