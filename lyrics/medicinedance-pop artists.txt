Hit four, actually Okay, umm...Okay, so I kind of want to tell the story of this song It started off as a dream, or a  in the woods In the moon of the budding trees I was gifted new eyes to see All of the shifting shape and ways you can be Wake the dreams into realities Wake the dreams into realities Sunset diamonds trickle down our cheeks The language of no words is how we speak Pachamama spinning firelight And a Little Bear singing by the fireside Out of this city with the wind on our neck, check That's us whistling upon your neck Moonlit diamonds sparkle into my mouth Feels like hunger and it tastes like salt Feels like hunger and it tastes like salt So, tap me out and tap me into you Heal my brain and my body too Balance my chemistry, hydrate these cells Cause the body talks and meditation helps The body talks and meditation helpsI believe in the good things comin’, comin’, comin’ comin’I believe in the good things comin’, comin’, comin’ comin’Out of darkness, lion heart pumpin’, pumpin’, pumpin’ pumpin’Into white light, all things runnin’, runnin’, runnin’ runnin’Who have I been, who am I becomin’  'comin', 'comin', 'comin', 'comin'Deep breaths for a young man learnin’, learnin’, learnin’, learnin’Take a walk with the cedars hummin’, cityscape, pink sunset stunnin’Every empty space is fittin’, every fire kindle burnin’I believe in the good things comin’, comin’, comin’ comin’I believe in the good things comin’, comin’, comin’ comin’Said, I am no master, I know nothin' But I am a servant and I know somethin’, yeah I am no master, I know nothin', definitely still young Built on hunger so fuckin’ stubborn a lot of self-work undone I am a witness, uh-huh uh-huh The life of one who carries all of his secrets in his music, music, music, music oh oh More pages, more words to my story More grace, more meaning unfoldin’More grace, more meaning unfoldin’More grace, more meaning unfoldin’Take a drive, green fog, cascadia Feel the warmth in my cold heart, radiant Two shakes and I’m feelin’ weightless Heart aches but it's actually painless Take a vow in the Pele moonlight, moonlight, moonlight, moonlight, moonlight Take a look at myself through my third eye, third eye, third eye, third eye, third eye)Everything’s already alright, always alright, always alrightLend your ears, lend your hands Lend your movement, anything you can Come to teach, come to be taught Come in the likeness in the image of God'Cause you can be like that With all that humbleness, and all that respect All of the power invested in me Be it hard to love my enemies All of the black bags over the heads of the dead and dying The more I understand about the human race The less I comprehend about our purpose and place And maybe if there was a clearer line The curiosity would satisfy Time-based prophecies that kept me from living In the moment I am struggling To trust the divinity of all the gods And what the hell they have planned for us I cry for the creatures who get left behind But everything will change in a blink of an eye And if you wish to survive You will find the guide inside I go back and forth every single day The clarity it comes to me in the choppy waves As the feelings and the places And the seasons change The galaxies remain Energy fields pullin’ up out of this space The angels that are composting the spiritual waste The hate that gets me displaced from my spiritual place Ten fold the manna when the planets are in place, in polar alignment We’re on assignment Bodies on consignment Return them to the circus And what is the purpose What is the purpose and would you believe it Would you believe itHit four, actually Okay, umm...Okay, so I kind of want to tell the story of this song It started off as a dream, or a  in the woods In the
