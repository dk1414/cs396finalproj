When you wake up to white walls And endless halls There's an emptiness that echoes through it all So sit back in your bed With your mind medicated And your senses stuck on the sick scent of the dead You can call for the doctor It's all you've got any more He's the ticket to the life you had before If I could just make them see that I don't need this Doctor, doctor what am I here for Can't you see that I don't need this place I don't need these walls I'm no threat at all Doctor, doctor what am I here for Can't you see that I don't need this place I don't need these walls I'm no threat at all Is there a way we could maybe through therapy Find a way to rate and release me I just need to be outside Even if supervised Get back to my job, back to my lifeIt's all about the song in my head The one where the audience is all dead These days they're allowing Visitation to aid in my rehabilitation To make these days mean so much more to me I beg friends and family for forgiveness And now for the first time together we'll witness Together we'll live this song I've been living incessantly So come sing with me Through these poison pills and chemicals I know that you'll lose something beautiful And brilliant, release will be instant I'm sorry its the only way It's all about the song in my head The one where the audience is all dead So come over to my house Catch up over dinner We're having strychnine and sirloin Port wine and paint thinner You'll convulse through the chorus It's the song of a sinnerThe first night after your released No one expects you to get much sleep You're the waking walking dead In my case, I'm not much better Walk through the kitchen and grab a marker Trace the path the blood will flow The lines I wear around my wrists are there to prove that I exist Tomorrow it will be easier to forgive myself, and remember her Without a guilty head, these nightmare lines, an empty heart We take for granted all the things that make us who we are Get up  Get dressed  Go to work  They all know who you are They can't believe you'd show up here, but that's just who they are Set up shop at your machine, calibrate, remember who you are Here lies clarity in a perfect grave comprised of perfect steel The perfect blade glows a perfect white against the perfect lines from this perfect night I'm the perfect picture of complacency, and that's all I feel Slow motion replaces real time As the horror fills their eyes These claws will never kill again I am a monster clothed in crimson sleeves And perforated lines where my wrists should be A warehouse full of workers scramble like a pack of Bewildered wolves as my world turns blackOn some nights you'll find me falling I am formless I am shapeless And on some nights I'm better left alone You take it all in from some severed state of stasis You scream, "wake up", inside your own body but You're buried or suffocating or worse Tonight it's worse Tonight the screaming hurts Tonight it's worse Tonight I'm wrapped up in her We find each other under Blankets as warm as summer We are inseparable Our bodies know what they're for And we give in, we explore Each other desperate for Something inseparable This coma kiss is infinite And I may take your tongue if you stay We are this dream - fluid and intricate We made it that way Every nightmare needs an influence And your body turning blue as you lay Directly next to me colors this one In bluish hues and darker graysPicture yourself in a nightmarish scene of such Grotesque complexity that you'd kill to be dreaming Your body's been dying, while your mind has been trying To make you picture a life where you'd kill for your Lover and a song in your head  The deaths of countless Others simply set up the lyrics for your symphony That's where you'll find me Something awful has happened here..this is This is so much worse than i ever could have imagined I knew it all along that this man should not have been released God, what's happened here, he's completely torn his entire apartment apart The smell is overpowering, a fowl pungent odor Like rotten food or i don't know, possibly something worse But there's something else that's almost overpowering I think its a woman's perfume, oh no..no..I found the patient he's lying on the floor in the center of the living room Completely naked, emaciated, deathly pale, it appears he hasn't eaten anything at all for weeks The infection has spread up his arms, it must have reached his brain There's bulging bright red veins all the way up from his wrist to his neck There's empty bottles everywhere, of alcohol and medication My god this smell is sickening There's blood coming out of his mouth nose ears He's not dead yet, but he's close I failed, this is my fault And somehow, he's smiling at me, i think he's whispering something No, not just whispering, i think he's singing..... I dialed 911 a long time ago Now I see how late they're reacting Here shakes a former lover/husband And there lies the wife Of a train wreck just waiting to happen My God, make this a dream because I really can't believe that she's gone I'm not here and this isn't happening Make this a dream because I really can't believe that she's gone We'll wake up and she'll be next to me I can't believe that she's gone Marvel at this madman as this make-shift monster rips through the room Watch in in fear as he comes completely unglued Gaze in horror and amazement for a frightening instant As he christens the walls with broken bottles of perfume Her few, final moments must have been a nightmare in waking Victim lies, violently shaking My God, make this a dream because I really can't believe that she's gone I'm not here and this isn't happening Make this a dream because I really can't believe that she's gone We'll wake up and she'll be next to me I can't believe that she's gone I can't breathe...I dont deserve to take these breaths All I need is to sit and rest my head on my knees The ambulance and police will be here soonThe smell of her perfume Struggles to cover everything Inside this ringing room Though once subdued, the silence seems to sing Whoa-oh, I told you so!Whoa-oh, I told you so!My name is evidence My role is undeniable Unless I've become inadmissable In crimes of consequence I'm only as reliable as the defendant's defense is defendable I am the kill Though I'm unwilling to be still and accept evil As my own personal - and sentient will Nothing makes sense anymore When murder's just a mistake that you have made Nothing makes sense anymore So a sick and guilty man will be born again with conscience saved Judicial precedent will see to that I'll see to that He'll see to that It's impossible given the incident Given his catatonic state, to imagine it playing out any other wayLast call at the hospital You slept through it all And these four walls warn you That your surgery, it might not be the key To fix the memory of you and me Doctor, I don't know what I've done There's more to this than my Ex-love and my ex-limbs could ever in my life begin to explain Everytime I think of her and what went on that night I don't see it, instead I hear it A song so awful and so perfect Last call at the hospital You slept through it all And these four walls warn you That your surgery, it might not be the key To fix the memory of you and me Doctor, I don't know what I'm gonna do I need this song to be shouted out And to be heard by everyone Its like each word and every chord refuses to be ignored This is bigger than me But with no hands and even less skill I don't know how it ever will come outYou and me You know that we were always funny in a Car crash sort of way Watch me bruise and bleed for you I always knew that I'd end up dead today.  today.  today So I'm going to tear down the sky And all the dull stars tonight So I can stay hidden and live in the black I hate being famous for my hits And never for my misses Bloody kisses from poison lips Leave lovers dead in ditches So, pass another round around for the kids Who have nothing left to lose And for those souls old and sold out By the soles of my shoes Drag my corpse through the cities I never got to visit Promise don't let me miss it Promise don't let me miss it Drag my corpse through the cities I never got to visit Promise don't let me miss itWhen you're left with only a bullet I'll bring the trigger with the promise to pull it I'll be the end of everyone who's ever entered your life And taken peices out of it I'll give you enough time to regain your composure To reconstruct a heart that's torn apart from over-exposure I know forever isn't long enough to forget the faces and places That played out your tragedy Our memory defeats us all I've touched this stagnant water and muddy walls of the trench Where you've been sleeping And there's nothing there worth keeping or believing So on the eve of the attack We'll finger-trace the targets On their backs and open fire Just hold on until they're gone So with this kiss I promise to Never forget what you did for me I felt the sun on my face for the first time And tasted blood on my tongue for the last
