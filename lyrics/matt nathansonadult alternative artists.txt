I miss the sound of your voice And I miss the rush of your skin And I miss the still of the silence As you breathe out and I breathe in If I could walk on water If I could tell you what's next I'd make you believe I'd make you forget So come on, get higher, loosen my lips Faith and desire and the swing of your hips Just pull me down hard And drown me in love So come on, get higher, loosen my lips Faith and desire and the swing of your hips Just pull me down hard And drown me in love I miss the sound of your voice The loudest thing in my head And I ache to remember All the violent, sweet Perfect words that you saidI don't wanna see the wires in the circus anymore I wanna dream and make believe people can fly I don't need to be reminded what it takes to kill the fun I've got a head full of sharp knives Yeah, it's easy to get colder And it's easy to forget So meet me where the light's dim We can wake up every mornin'We can set ourselves on fire And we can do it all again The world don't speak for us They lack the confidence Yeah, we're only hearts and bones and blood Oh, but we are giants Giants The walls are closing in We climb and they descend With nothing but the clouds against our skin Oh, we are giants GiantsOh, oh Oh, oh Cinderella's gone to New York City Wants to shave her hair and disappear18 years of never feeling pretty Says she's finally thinking clear Ain't too proud to swim or drown now baby Ain't too proud to sink or see it through She said Everybody wants to be with me I got all I need I feel invincible with my headphones on Everybody posed for magazines It's all just noise to me I feel invincible with my headphones on Oh Oh If anybody comes around to find me If anybody asks for me she said Tell 'em all I'm in the deep end singing With this music in my headI fell asleep Had a dream Bill Murray and I were friends We drove the world, from Boston to Japan Blasting old Van Halen and one night over drinks, Bill started crying He said to me, "Kid,""Of all the stupid things I ever did""You know, I let go when I should've pulled her in"And he handed me his cell phone But when I called, you were on a plane Moving back to Portland for the rain I won't only love you when you're winning Other fools pretend to understand Come on, take my hand and we'll go down swinging Let me be your man Let me be your man A hundred days we hiked the coast of Galway in the rain And Bill said something late one night in Spain And it's always just stuck with me"You only get one person knows you best""And it's temporary, everybody else"Rent love, run in circles Sweet fiction silhouette Meet me at 9th and Irving Let's do things we can both regret It's all there in your chipped red fingernails It's all there in the twist of your pigtails It's the way she walks The way she talks Can't stop thinking About the girl in the kinks shirt Take me home, San Francisco Can't stop thinking about the girl in the kinks shirt You and my imagination You and my imagination You and my imagination Can't stop thinking about the girl in the kinks shirt Sidewalk mariachis I see you in your party dress Played out Sid and Nancy Bring on the apocalypseSomewhere in between the beginning and the end September took the tourists and settled in for good We could hear the trains again Brooklyn girls in scarves Summer left and no one said a word And we'd open your window and stay in your bed All day 'til the streetlights came on What happened to bulletproof weeks in your arms What happened to feeling cheap radio songs What happened to thinking that the world was flat What happened So up on 59th steet right before the rains Lovers catching taxis going downtown I'm talking to what's left of you I'm watching what I say Counting all the freckles on your perfect face You open your window, I sit on your bed Just waiting for right words to come So, what happened to bulletproof weeks in your arms What happened to feeling cheap radio songs What happened to thinking that the world was flat What happened to thatAnd it's amazing with the look in your eyes Like you could save me But you won't even try And then you tell me again How everything will be alright And if I told you that I'm sorry Would you tell me you were wrong Would you hold me down forever If I came to you for answers I saw pictures in my head And I swear I saw you opening up again Cause I would be heavenly If baby, you'd just rescue me now And I'm surrounded You spill all alive and brand new And I'll forget about you long enough To forget why I need to I saw pictures in my head And I swear I saw you opening up again Cause I would be heavenly If baby, you'd just rescue me nowShe said this talking Kind of wears me out And all these salesmen Baby, make me tired They're no good To tell you the truth, she said I've been getting used to liars These silly love songs With store bought words They make me promises Like politicians So we stumble And we disconnect Over and over again This modern love is not enough She said, watch your back I'm nobodies girlfriend This modern love is not enough Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh They said one big exhale never did me no, good I let em in, I Oh man, I let 'em win I'd burn my house down Just to hear them scream my name I've carried hopes And heavy daydreams, she said But I'm done with sleeping Take the phone calls Take this circus Take the drama'Cause baby it's just worthlessI'd never fall in love with someone else again If I could only taste your lips and this adrenaline I'd never leave here, never leave your bed I forgot how good this could feel Close my eyes holding the steering wheel Spilling my confessions, midnight on the 405 We really shouldn't be left alone The way we get into each other's bones, yeah Cause you've got your life now and I've got mine Take me home, I'm dying I'd never fall in love with someone else again If I could only taste your lips and this adrenaline I'd never leave here, never leave your bed Ah ooh oh Ah ooh oh I'd never leave here, never leave your bed You said you still remember the words To every single song that we heard Driving California, sky looked like a swimming pool Ever since you pulled me apart In darkness in that garden in Echo Park, yeah Dreams come easy; I just disappear in youI wanna watch you undress I wanna watch you glow Let your hair down All around and cover us both You come in waves We crash and we roll You surround me, pull me, drown me, then swallow me whole You turn, turn, turn, turning me on Like a slow fire burn I know that it's wrong Still I run, run, run, run right into you Yeah, I run, run, run, run right into you Oh, oh, oh You pull me in close You buckle my knees I shake and I shiver just to feel you breathe You trace my lines I trace your lines Stirring my soul Shoot sparks at the heart of the world and I watch it explode I watch you, yeah, I watch you
