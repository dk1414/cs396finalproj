go Go Go Johnny go Go Go Johnny go Go Go Johnny go Go Johnny B  Goode He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track Oh, the engineerswould see him sitting in the shade Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made People passing by they would stop and say Oh my that little country boy could play Go go Go Johnny go Go Go Johnny go Go Go Johnny go Go Go Johnny go Go Johnny B  Goode His mother told him "Someday you will be a man And you will be the leader of a big old band Many people coming from miles around To hear you play your music when the sun

the studio late last night The telephony answered the phone He said your woman’s on the line and it don’t sound fine With problems that I wouldn’t even know But I picked it up and asked, well the first thing she screamed I’m bored Yeah!I said come on baby can’t you see I’m losing lots of dollars on the phone Yeah!I said in maybe six days I’ve been working on this tape Then I’m prying right

thousand Horsepower ain’t it thrilling brother So I’m running in the night I can keep her looking fine For my fans all dressed in blue Just last week I got a paper from a man at my door And you can bet your ass he gotta pleasure out of handing me a bone It said dear Mr  Racer were here to take away your papers You ain’t running no more!And if you think that’s funny well get a load of this one We’re taking your machine to gallop in the bottom of the barrel Yeah  I got the bottom of the barrel bluesStuck in New York City Not a penny to my name I Blew it all down in Texas On Women and Cocaine I've been riding an endless highway A highway long and cold The only shoulder for me to cry on Was the woman on the side of the road Woman she can be so cold Tearin up my soul She makes a man grow old But I love her just the same Had me a dark eyed lover She had a dark eyed lovers name And I gave her all my loving But she didn't love me the same The one bad thing about her She played a game from the start She couldn't give a damn and all around She just kept breaking my heart Woman she can be so mean Soo mean Tearing all of my dreams But I love her just the sameIn the early dawn as I contemplate my life When I'm alone my mind will roam And wander And as I reflect on the blessings in my life At times it seems I often dream…And wonder In the light of day on a welcome afternoon I feel the sun… no need to run Or hurry And at times like this it's impossible to brood It's all O.K.… I'm far away From worry But in the middle of the night Sometimes things don't seem quite right And I feel like I'm falling It's an unnecessary fear Of the kind you often hear So I reach out for the words in the book As I read it thе message of history unfolds I feel alive and know thе truth is speaking And the words pour out and they reach into my soul I close my eyes and know the Lord is teachingShe's lookin' for love all the time She's waiting for words that are kind She's playing for time all the time And I'm happy she's mine, all mine My Angela Since you came into my life My life's been love all the time She's makin' a face like she's mad There's not a trace that she's bad She wants a place with her dad And she's jealous of anyone who's had him My Nadia Since you came into my life My life's been fun all the time They don't know now How much thеy mean They won't know how much until they'vе grown But I know how…How much I love them And I don't believe I've received this dream They don't know now How much they mean They won't know how much until they've grown But I know how…How much I love them And I don't believe I've received this dreamWell listen, someday You'll hear a rush of wings So distant, a sound of secret things There, look there, up in that rusty sky Yonder, sweeps the dragonfly So awesome, he blocks the setting sun He'll come to collect the souls of everyone Come dragon, come In from the sun He floats with an eerie grace A giant blue green sentinal From some distant time and space And because he'll come, he'll have no regrets Surely he'll come to lay this birth to rest I know one day you'll see him But please don't ask me why He will be a secret dragonfly Fly dragon fly, here from the sky So if you hear that sound I'm talkin' about When you know he's near When your times run out Well don't you fear There's nothing that you can say Cause he'll appear and take you to that special place He'll take you there He'll take you there He'll take you there He'll take you there He'll take you there He'll take you .......
