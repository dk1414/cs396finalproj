I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand Life is good today, life is good today Well, the plane touched down just about three o'clock And the city's still on my mind Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head I was still in the baggage line Concrete and cars are their own prison bars Like this life I'm living in But the plane brought me farther, I'm surrounded by water And I'm not going back again I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand Life is good today, life is good today Adios and vaya con Dios Yeah, I'm leaving G AAnd if it weren't for tequila and pretty señoritas I'd have no reason to stay Adios and vaya con Dios Yeah, I'm leaving G AGoing to lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one And grab my guitar and playShe'd trade Colorado if he'd take her with him Closes the door 'fore the winter lets the cold in And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay She's answered by the taillights shinin' through the window pane He said, I want to see you again But I'm stuck in colder weather Maybe tomorrow will be better Can I call you then She said, you're ramblin' man And you ain't ever gonna change You've got a gypsy soul to blame And you were born for leavin'At a truck stop diner, just outside of Lincoln The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin'And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same old light is shinin'He thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him He said, I want to see you again But I'm stuck in colder weather Maybe tomorrow will be better Can I call you then She said, you're ramblin' man And you ain't ever gonna change You've got a gypsy soul to blame And you were born for leavin'Born for leavin'You know I like my chicken fried Cold beer on a Friday night A pair of jeans that fit just right And the radio up Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine And that's home you know Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine where the peaches grow And my house it's not much to talk about But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground And a little bit of chicken fried Cold beer on a Friday night A pair of jeans that fit just right And the radio up Well I've seen the sun rise See the love in my woman's eyes Feel the touch of a precious child And know a mother's love It's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind This I've come to know So if you agree, have a drink with me Raise your glasses for a toastGoing to put the the world away for a minute Pretend I don't live in it Sunshine going to wash my blues away Had sweet love but I lost it She got too close so I fought it Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky Never been so happy Never felt so high And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise Wrote a note said be back in a minute Bought a boat and I sailed off in it Don't think anybody's going to miss me anyway Mind on a permanent vacation The ocean is my only medication Wishing my condition ain't ever going to go away Now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky Never been so happy Never felt so high And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradiseI got a piece of land out in the countryside Lay back and smell the sun warm up the Georgia pine Feels so good to be taking it easy Why would I ever leave  'Cause I know I got some good friends that live down the street Got a good lookin' woman with her arms 'round me Here in a small town where it feels like home I've got everything I need and nothing that I don't Homegrown Homegrown We got a fire goin' down by the riverside Sip whiskey out the bottle, livin' like we'll never die Come on and stay a while if you don't believe me Why would I ever leave  'Cause I know I got some good friends that live down the street Got a good lookin' woman with her arms 'round me Here in a small town where it feels like home I've got everything I need and nothing that I don't Homegrown Homegrown Homegrown Homegrown I got some good friends that live down the street Got a good lookin' woman with her arms 'round me Here in a small town where it feels like home I've got everything I need And nothing that I don't Everything I need And nothing I don't It's the weight that you carry from the things That you think you want It's the weight that you carry from the things That you think you want Weight you carry It's the weight that you carry from the things That you think you want It's the weight that you carry from the things That you think you want I've got everything I need, nothing that I don't Everything I need, nothing that I don't Everything I need, nothing that I don't Oh, everything I need and nothing that I don'tHometown hero at the bar Burned out high life super star You know Kept a buzz to fill the hole Loved the lights and stole the show Someone I used to know Would stay another round Someone I used to know Ran himself in the ground It’s been a long time comin’Couldn’t keep on runnin’Had to hit rock bottom to know When you keep on losin’With the path you’re choosin’And it’s time to let go Of someone that I used to know Know, know Know, know Someone that I used to knowI got a death wish Her looks can kill She's got a red dress Lipstick and heels Pull me in Get me hooked like a junkie You got me feeling so high You’re such a beautiful drug I can't get enough Addicted and I'm dying for a hit of your love Got a death wish baby, baby Don't want you to save me, save me She lets her hair down And all of mine stand up Can't help but stare now Gotta feel that touch Her kiss, my fix, so sweet Can't quit those lips are a habit to me Sweet intoxication and I'm never getting sober I can tell that the effects are taking over Pull me in, get me hooked like a junkie You got me feeling so high tonightCan't tell where the sky begins and the water ends No clouds to hide the sun Waves playing me a symphony upon the sand As I lay drifting on the ocean with this bottle in my hand Sat down on the boardwalk for a little while Your memory my company Something 'bout this place had a way to make you smile You always loved the sound of waves The wind whistling 'cross my bottle still can’t blow away the sorrow That tomorrow you won't be here with me So I raise it up and toast the day we met Won't forget the way you love me, amazing way you love me It's bittersweet, you see You're not here but I can feel you Every memory is on the tip of my tongue Close my eyes, see your face, hold on tight to yesterday And when I wake, it was just a dream It's bittersweet Doctor said there's nothing we can do Took my hand said, "Take me home To the only place half a chance to take the pain away Let me feel alive before I go"He was a giant And I was just a kid I was always trying To do everything he did I can still remember every lesson he taught me Growing up learning how to be like my old man He was a lion We were our father's pride But I was defiant When he made me walk the line He knew how to lift me up And when to let me fall Looking back, he always had a plan My old man My old man Feel the callous on his hands And dusty overalls My old man Now I finally understand I have a lot to learn From my old manEvery morning when you come downstairs Hair's a mess but I don't care No makeup on and shining so bright My old sweatshirt never fit so right Dancing around to the radio Humming the words that you don't know Cross out finding an angel off my list Thinking that it don't get no better than this You make loving you easy You make loving you all I wanna do Every little smile and every single touch Reminds me just how much it all makes Loving you easy Wrapped around me late at night Pillow talk by candle light Gonna slow this down and make it last The best things fly by us so fast You make loving you easy You make loving you all I wanna do Every little smile and every single touch Reminds me just how much it all makes
