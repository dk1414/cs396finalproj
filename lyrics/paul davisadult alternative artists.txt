Hello, girl, it's been a while Guess you'll be glad to know That I've learned how to laugh and smile Getting over you was slow They say old lovers can be good friends But I never thought I'd really see you I'd really see you again I go crazy When I look in your eyes, I still go crazy No, my heart just can't hide That old feelin' inside Way deep down inside Oh, baby You know when I look in your eyes I go crazy You say he satisfies your mind Tells you all of his dreams I know how much that means to you I realize that I was blind Just when I thought I was over you I see your face and it just ain't true No, it just ain't trueI sometimes wonder why all the flowers have to die I dream about you and now summer's come and gone And the nights they seem so long Come on over tonight, come on over It's gonna be a cool night Just let me hold you by the firelight If it don't feel right, you can go Oh, when the cool night Brings back memories of a good life When this love was not so old Oh, I
