Somewhere in a lonely hotel room There's a guy starting to realize That eternal fate has turned its back on him It's two A.M It's two A.M., the fear has gone I'm sitting here waitin', the gun's still warm Maybe my connection is tired of takin' chances Yeah, there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head Wrapped up in silence, all circuits are dead Cannot decode, my whole life spins into a frenzy Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned My beacon's been moved under moon and star Where am I to go now that I've gone too far Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned My beacon's been moved under moon and star Where am I to go now that I've gone too far I've been drivin' all night, my hands wet on the wheel There's a voice in my head that drives my heel It's my baby callin', says, "I need you here"And it's a-half-past four and I'm shifting gear When she is lonely and the longing gets too much She sends a cable coming in from above Don't need no phone at all We've got a thing and that's a-called radar love We've got a wave in the air Radar love The radio's playing some forgotten song Brenda Lee's "Coming On Strong"The road has got me hypnotized And I'm a-speedin' into a new sunrise When I get lonely and I'm a-sure I've had enough She sends her comfort coming in from above We don't need no letter at allI could bet on new years eve He'd call me up at night From the other side of the world Ed was always there alright Ed's got the looks of a movie star Ed's got the smile of a prince He ride a bike instead of a car I want to be his friend Dancing in the living room With the ladies so nice Like a child with a wisdom tooth He's just a friend of mine Ed's got the rings and the colors Ed's got the wind in his hair He goes a riding with the brothers He's got a fist in the air Going to the run, run Angel Going to the run, run Angel Well, heaven and hell came together that night Only for you this time Going to the run, forever Angel One summer at the festival Holding on real tight On the back of a Harley He took me for a ride in the sky Ed's got the looks of a movie star Ed's got the smile of a prince He'd ride a bike instead of a car I'll always be his friendWhen the lady smiles You know it drives me wild Her lips are warm and resourceful When her fingertips go drawing Circles in the night Then the mood is soft and sensual And I love it, yeah I love it It's the answer to all my dreams Every time it feels like the earth is shaking It doesn't matter A glass is falling I hear it shatter Maybe it's raining Faster and faster Shadow dancing Together oh I I'm a-betting on the game of love Oh oh oh I I'm betting that love is gonna come out When the walls no longer shout Back at me, and I'm feeling proudHere comes the night A veil over the light In the distance some shadows of the clouds in the sky I've got to get home, to my child, my wife Here comes the night I'm scared to death, got to get me a ride It looks like the road is swallowing me up Gotta hurry home, don't dare to look back Blueville is straight ahead Another 45 miles to go Another 45 miles before Im home I wish that the sunlight was burning in my eyes Instead of shades black faces of the sky Another 45 miles to go Another 45 miles before Im home I wish i could pay the sun to run Then I had some more time, with my wife, my son Clouds in the sky Gathering for a fight Chasing their prey till it can't go on I mend my pace 'cos my bride is waiting home Here comes the night I'm scared to death, got to get me a ride It looks like the road is swallowing me up Gotta hurry home, don't dare to look back Blueville is straight aheadCandy took the pearls, got ahead of the girls Got on top and found the secret entrance Are you satisfied Through neon doors, ‘cross killing floors She got sucked into a champagne desert Are you satisfied Daddy said: I'll break your bones If you come home dressed in Peacock clothes Mother said: quit the show She didn't want the neighbours to know Candy had to quit the show Well, Candy didn't care, when she started her affair With the studs and the mares of the night Are you satisfied Teddy knows the rule, of the underground school He's got Candy wrapped ‘round his finger Are you satisfied Daddy said: I'll break your bones If you don't get your tricks off the phone Mother said: quit the show She didn't want the neighbours to know Candy's going bad -
