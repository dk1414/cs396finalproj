I ain't hanging up this time I ain't giving up tonight Even if you walk around as though you think you're right At your worst, I still believe it's worth the fight I could make it all go away Tell me what you’re thinking, don't delay We could still be having some sweet memories This heart still beats for you, why can't you see Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight Stop your crying, it's alright Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight Stop pretending I'm not there When it's clear I'm not going anywhere If I'm out of sight, then take another look around I'm still out there hoping to be found Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight Stop your crying, it's alright Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight Shut up, kiss me, hold me tightI quit my dreaming the moment that I found you I started dancing just to be around you Here's to thinking that it all meant so much more I kept my mouth shut and opened up the door I wanted nothing but for this to be the end For this to never be a tied and empty hand If all the trouble in my heart would only mend I lost my dream, I lost my reason all again It's not just me for you I have to look out too I have to save my life I need some peace of mind I am the only one now I am the only one now I am the only one now You may not be around You may not be around You may not be around I am the only one now I am the only one now I am the only one now I am the only one nowSaw it in her eyes Oh, it wasn't what she said She came together like a dream That I didn't know I had From the sleeping life I lead All the colors I have seen I can't help but recognize The brighter one in front of me All the truth I thought I learned And then it finally came along Turned around and then it's there All the love I thought was gone I want to know you I want to show you I want to be there I want to see her Piece us together Know it's forever Show me the future Tell me you'll be there I want to go where Nobody knows fear I want to follow My heart down that wild roadBefore we draw, my dear dear friend I promise you my word If we should part, my dear dear love You know you’re in my heart And though I may be getting older Know that I'm going with you Know that I'm hanging on to the things that you said The things that you said I felt my soul rise up from my body When I look into your blue eyes If cosmic force is real at all It’s come between you and I I want to be naked I don’t mean my body I don’t need my body I’m floating away I’m floating away I’m floating awayComing from an endless place Heaven hits me when I see your face I go blind, every time Hate to have to watch you go Thought I'd been through this Lord knows I've been trying, I'm still trying You'll never be mine You'll never be mine You'll never be mine You'll never be mine You'll never be mine You'll never be mine But I would watch you, I would watch you Turn and walk away I would watch you look right through me Right through every word that I say He wants to know why He wants to know why I only want to know you I want to tell him I know the feeling This time I swear that I doTo forget you is to hide There  is still so much left to recover If  only we could start again Pretending we don't know each other I could not come back the same This  city's changed, it's not what it was Back  when you loved me Walking down that path we made When  we thought what we had was such a good thing Hiding out inside my head It's me again, it's no surprise I'm on my own now Every  time I turn to you I see the past, it's all that lasts And all I know how Learn to look me in the eyes Yet I still don't feel it's me you're facing Say your heart is always mine What about old times  You can't erase them Wishing we could only find one another All we've done here is blind one another Hate can't live in this heart here forever Have to learn how to make it together The way you scream like something else is a matter The way you scream like something else is a matter The way you scream like something else is a—I've been watchin' all of my past repeatin'There's no endin', and when I stop pretendin'See you standin', a million moments landin'On your smile, buried alive, I could have Died to stay there, never have to leave there All this trouble tryin' to catch right up with me I keep movin', knowin' someday that I will be Standin', facin', all mirrors are erasin'Losin' beauty, at least at times it knew me At least at times it knew me At least at times it knew me Standing, facin', all mirrors are erasin'Losin' beauty, at least at times it knew me Standin', facin', all mirrors are erasin'Losin' beauty, at least at times it knew me At least at times it knew me At least at times it knew meWill the marker stain the skin Stole the dress I saw you in Now nothing comes to mind Saw a life as override One more session overdrive The ceiling is the roof Change address and draw a line Show my friends a silver lie Call my family just to know they're there Sleeping in late like I used to Crossing my fingers like I used to Waiting inside like I used to Avoiding big crowds like I used to Crawl the field and let you in Brand my hеart I found you in To say nothing's more apart Will my lover be thеre, stay Follow them to less the pain The ceiling must be wrongMaybe you know that it's been too long Going through the motions as you sing your song Doesn't matter who you are or what you've done Still gotta wake up and be someone Still gotta wake up and be someone I don't care what the papers say It's just another intern with a résumé I'm gonna fall in love with you someday I'm gonna fall in love and run away I'm gonna fall in love and run away Everyone I know has got their own ideal I just wanna be alive, make something real Doesn't matter who you are or what you do Something in the world will make a fool of you Something in the world will make a fool of you Pick up the phone, but I swear it's the last time Pick up the phone, but I swear it's the last time Falling in love and I swear it's the last time Falling in love and I swear it's the last timeYou can leave now if you want to I'll still be around This parade is almost over And I'm still your clown I've been thinking How your smile seems to last forever Even if it's just a while We are there together There together With no promise of the future Am I not allowed To think kindly of a stranger Who reflects the sound Of my heartache As it's beating My life to the ground To the ground To the ground To the ground To the ground And I could still breathe for you Open up and scream for you Tell me what I wouldn't do Tell me that love isn't true Tell me that love isn't true Tell me that love isn't true I dare you to understand What makes me a woman What makes me a woman What makes me a woman
