Sitting at a tiny table in a ritzy restaurant She was staring at her coffee cup He was trying to keep his courage up by applying booze Talk was small when they talked at all, they both knew what they wanted There was no need to talk about it They were old enough to scope it out and keep it loose She said, you don't look like my type, but I guess you'll do Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous He said, I'll even tell you that I love you, if you want me too Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous When they left the bar, they got in his car and they drove away He drove to the family inn She didn't even have to pretend she didn't know what for Then he went to the desk and made his request while she waited outside And he came back with the key And she said, give it to me and I'll unlock the door She kept saying, I've never really done this kind of thing before, have you Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous And he said, yes I have, but only a time or two Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous Third rate romance, low rent rendezvousEvery time the bluebird sings A heart takes wings to the sky With bluebird grace I'll fly out of my place in your eyes'Cause after all, I did what I could And you did your best, just the same Nobody won, we both lost And no one's to blame I'll fly away to you Only pretending We'll be like bluebirds too The beautiful lie After all, I did what I could And you did your best, just the same Nobody won, we both lost And no one's to blame I'll fly away to you Only pretending We'll be like bluebirds too The

seen a lawyer And the papers are clear If you don't like the charges When you read it my dear Think back to the times When you were cheating on me You'll find the charges are true I'm setting me free Now listen here honey You been doing me wrong And I ain't said nothing For so doggone long But I don't like the way You been treating me So early tomorrow I'm setting you freeI have heard the cannons thundering all night And I cannot sleep for wondering why's a rebel's cause so right And the morphine seems to do no good at all And I would run away it I would not fall I joined the southern cavalry for fun And I had rode a thousand horses Always had a way with a gun Now I'm among the horseless riders lying still Swallowed up by the cause on the widows hill And I dreamed about a rose in a Spanish garden And I kissed you and I placed it in your hair And if I'm ever on my feet again I will And I will run all the way just to meet you there Through the day I watched those southern boys go down And they lay like Georgia peaches bruised and broken on the ground Through the night I wondered was it worth the pain And I cried not revenge I called your name Now I'm among the horseless riders lying still Swallowed up by the cause on the widows hill And I dreamed about a rose in a Spanish garden And I kissed you and I placed it in your hair And if I'm ever on my feet again I will And I will run all the way just to meet you thereStandin' beside of the ocean, lookin' across the water Everything's beautiful here, but still don't feel like I oughta Things we wanted not so long ago I got 'em all now, but ain't got you no more But I remember The way you held me, all the sweet things you used to say When we were two young lovers dancin' the night away I remember everything, dresses you used to wear Looked so right and graceful, you seemed to float right through the air I looked so funny dancin', but you loved me anyhow I guess I could find somebody to love me like that now But I remember The way you held me, all the sweet things you used to say When we were two young lovers dancin' the night away Standin' beside of the ocean, lookin' across the bay I should look for companionship, but it just gets in my way Lights are flickerin' out along the shore People dancin' there, but I don't dance no moreYou're a typical American boy from a typical American home Started out with a couple of breaks you couldn't leave well enough alone You had to keep on messing around with stuff you didn't understand You were miserable as a child and you're even worse as a man Didn't make it hanging around the house you wasn't having very much fun Should have got a job in New Jersey But you're a play piece son of a gun You drifted into the city looking for something to do Every day was different and it was always something new You were always ready to try something that you ain't tried Pretty soon your mind said "Son you better look for a place to hide"You didn't do to well in college, didn't dig the intellectual scene Never soaked up very much knowledge so you thought about joining the marines Oh that stuff didn't last too long and you never learned how to fight But you sure learned how to get right tonight You seemed to have lost direction, wandered from bar to bar Everybody in the whole damn place is wondering who you are I believe you would go on home if you had any place to go But there ain't nobody waiting for you that you would even care to know If you spoke the language you could move to a foreign land But people talk to you in English here and you still don't understand Oh baby all right  But you sure know how to get right tonight Yes out of the darkness you follow that neon light And you sure know how to get right tonight Oh baby all right  You sure know how to get right tonightI was walkin' the dog I saw you sittin' on your veranda And when I came back thru You were tangoin' with Amanda Emma Jean Won't you unlock the back door screen And invite me in For some gin and lemonade I'd really love to love you My little half tropical maid Every time I pass by I can see thru you big screen door Two lovely lesbian ladies Slow dancing on the parquet floor Emma Jean Won't you unlock the back door screen And invite me in For some gin and lemonade I'd really love to love you My little half tropical maid I get the chills and fever Everytime I look in your face I just don't understand Why you don't ask me up to your place Emma Jean Won't you unlock the back door screen And invite me in For some gin and lemonade I'd really love to love you My little half tropical maid I'd love to love you My little half tropical maid I'd just love to love you My little tropical maidWell I work a Double shift at the plant And I work on the outside I'd like rather be back home Makin' love with my new bride And there's only two things That I want when I'm back At my double-wide That's a big ole brew And a little ole you And I know you're workin'Every day just as hard as I do If I didn't think that I might of loved you but I wouldn't say I do And there's only two things In the that I need to get close to Is a big ole brew And a little ole you Well I got both ends Meetin' in the middle But I can't seem to get 'em tied But I don't care long as I know you'll be by my sideAmazing Grace, used to be her favorite song Lord where's my good girl gone She was all I ever wanted She was an angel for sure She stands even now in my memory So sweet and pure But all that made me happy Was a bottle and a song Used to stay out drinkin'While she cried all night long Amazing Grace, used to be her favorite song Lord where's my good girl gone She thought she could make me Change in awhile so she learned How to drink and she learned how to smile I guess the pull of the bottle Was just a little bit to strong Now she's left me and I don't know where she's gone Amazing Grace, used to be her favorite song Lord where's my good girl gone And then one night she said "I'm goin'..."But she didn't say where It didn't seem to matter And I didn't really care But now that I'm sober And I can see it all I know I'm to blame for her fall Amazing Grace, used to be her favorite song Lord where's my good girl gone Lord where's my good girl gone Life is like a mountain railway With an engineer that's brave You must make a run successful From the cradle to the grave Watch the curves, the hills and tunnels Never falter, never fail Just keep your hand upon the throttle And your eyes upon the rail Blessed Savior Thou will guide us Till we reach that blissful shore Where the angels wait to join us In Thy praise forevermore Life is like a mountain railway With an engineer that's brave You must make a run successful From the cradle to the grave Watch the curves, the hills and tunnels Never falter, never fail Just keep your hand upon the throttle And your eyes upon the rail Blessed Savior Thou will guide us Till we reach that blissful shore Where the angels wait to join us In Thy praise forevermore
