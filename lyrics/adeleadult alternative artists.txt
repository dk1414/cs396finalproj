Hello, it's me I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet To go over everything They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing Hello, can you hear me I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be When we were younger and free I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet There's such a difference between us And a million miles Hello from the other side I must've called a thousand times To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done But when I call, you never seem to be home Hello from the outside At least, I can say that I've tried To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore Hello, how are you It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry I hope that you're well Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened There ain't no gold in this river That I've been washin' my hands in forever I know there is hope in these waters But I can't bring myself to swim When I am drowning in this silence Baby, let me in Go easy on me, baby I was still a child Didn't get the chance to Feel the world around me I had no time to choose what I chose to do So go easy on me There ain't no room for things to change When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways You can't deny how hard I've tried I changed who I was to put you both first But now I give up Go easy on mе, baby I was still a child Didn't get the chance to Feel thе world around me Had no time to choose what I chose to do So go easy on meI heard that you're settled down That you found a girl and you're married now I heard that your dreams came true Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend, why are you so shy Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it I had hoped you'd see my face And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you, too Don't forget me, I beg I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead You know how the time flies Only yesterday was the time of our lives We were born and raised in a summer haze Bound by the surprise of our glory daysThere's a fire starting in my heart Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark Finally, I can see you crystal clear Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare See how I'll leave with every piece of you Don't underestimate the things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark The scars of your love remind me of us They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all The scars of your love, they leave me breathless I can't help feeling We could've had it all Rolling in the deep You had my heart inside of your hand And you played it to the beat Baby, I have no story to be told But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn Think of me in the depths of your despair Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be sharedEverybody loves the things you do From the way you talk to the way you move Everybody here is watching you'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true But if by chance you're here alone Can I have a moment before I go 'Cause I've been by myself all night long Hoping you're someone I used to know You look like a movie You sound like a song My God, this reminds me Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light In case it is the last time that we might Be exactly like we were before we realised We were sad of getting old, it made us restless It was just like a movie It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears Nobody told me that you'd be here And I swear you'd moved overseas That's what you said when you left meI let it fall, my heart And as it fell, you rose to claim it It was dark, and I was over Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they were strong But my knees were far too weak To stand in your arms Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you That I never knew, never knew All the things you'd say They were never true, never true And the games you'd play You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain Watched it pour as I touched your face Well, it burned while I cried'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name Your nameI will leave my heart at the door I won't say a word They've all been said before, you know So why don't we just play pretend Like we're not scared of what is coming next Or scared of having nothing left Look, don't get me wrong I know there is no tomorrow All I ask is If this is my last night with you Hold me like I'm more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use Take me by the hand while we do What lovers do It matters how this ends'Cause what if I never love again I don't need your honesty It's already in your eyes And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me No one knows me like you do And since you're the only one that mattered Tell me, who do I run to Just the guitar Okay, cool This was all you, none of it me You put your hands on, on my body and told me Mmm, told me you were ready For the big one, for the big jump I'd be your last love, everlasting, you and me Mmm, that was what you told me I'm giving you up I've forgiven it all You set me free Send my love to your new lover Treat her better We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts We both know we ain't kids no more Send my love to your new lover Treat her better We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts We both know we ain't kids no moreHello, it's me I was wondering if after all these years
