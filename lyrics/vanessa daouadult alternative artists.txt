This is the long tunnel of wanting you Its walls are lined with remembered kisses Wet and red as the inside of your mouth Full and juicy as your probing tongue This is the long tunnel of wanting you This is the long tunnel of wanting you Warm as your belly against mine Deep as your navel leading home Soft as your sleeping cock beginning to stir Tight as your legs wrapped around mine This is the long tunnel of wanting you This is the long tunnel of wanting you Straight as your toes pointing toward the bed As you roll over and thrust your hardness Into the long tunnel of my wanting Straightening out my crooked pastMy love is too much It embarrasses you Blood, poems, babies Red needs that telephone From foreign countries Black needs that spatter the pages Of your white papery heart You would rather have A girl with simpler needs:Lunch, sex, undemanding loving Dinner, wine, bed The occasional blow-job And needs that are never red As gaping wounds But cool and blue as television screens in tract houses Oh my love Those simple girls With simple needs Read my books too They tell me they feel The same as I do They tell me I transcribe The language of their hearts They tell me I translate Their mute, unspoken pain Into the white light of languageYou're on time, I came early Just to see if you'd keep your word After everything I've heard I'm surprised I still have faith Your promise is so easy to break Today was a beautiful day There's just one thing that I'm missing The bittersweetness of your kissing One thing that I'm missing One thing that I'm missing One thing that I'm missing You're the type to mix love with liquid Stir it up into a troubling brew Make me lose my way Take the apple from the snake A habit you taught me Today was a beautiful day There's just one thing that I'm missing The bittersweetness of your kissing One thing that I'm One thing that I'm One thing that I'm missingAll you ask for is a little bit of pain It goes a long way All you wanted was the stinging of her rain Rolling down you face Just like you told her, there's nothing you won't do Crawling comes so easy Now that you're older you will lick her dirty boots Nothing is too sleazy You didn't know what love was You didn't know what pain does Let your arms ache, ache, ache Let your heart break, break, break, break, break All you wanted was the clinging of her vine To wrap around you Now you're dying for a swallow of her brine So she can drown you Gone to heaven, then it's back to hell You're climbing down her staircase All you wanted was to love this Jezebel Even angels make mistakesThe best slave does not need to be beaten, she beats herself Not with a leather whip or with stick or twigs Not with a blackjack or a billyclub but with the fine whip Of her own tongue and the subtle beating of her mind against her mind For who could hate her half so well as she hates herself And who can match the finesse of her self-abuse Years of training are required for this Twenty years of subtle self-indulgence Self-denial until the subject Thinks herself a queen and yet a beggar Both at the same time She must doubt herself in everything but love She must choose passionately and badly She must feel lost as a dog without her master She must refer all moral questions to her mirror She must fall in love with a cossack or a poet She must never go out of the house unless veiled in paint She must wear tight shoes so she always remembers her bondage She must never forget she is rooted in the ground Though she is quick to learn and admittedly clever Her natural doubt of herself should make her so weak That she dabbles brilliantly in half a dozen talents And thus embellishes but does not change our lifeShare your nights and your dreams Share your feelings deep as they may seem Your words may disappear If no one's there to hear Two to tango, two to move All we've got to do is see it through As the day fades away As the day fades away Two to tango when the evening comes And the rain goes with the midnight sun If you find your place Leave behind the troubles that you face Two to tango, two to move And all we've got to do is see it through As the day fades away As the day fades away As the day fades away As the day fades awayShow me your castles in the sky, castles in the sky We can climb there together High above the troubles that can bring us down We can rise forever Show me your secret places behind the world I know Let me in those darker spaces a thousand miles below Show me all your stormy nights when distant thunder rolls Let me feel your desolation in the rain and icy cold Show me the edges of your life tonight'Cause we've got nowhere left to go Show me the freest kind of love tonight All the world will never know, will never know Show me your wilderness, your wanderlusting eyes Tell me all your guilty sins and all your little lies Show me where your island is out on the open sea Tell me where your desert blooms and where your mind runs free Show me the edges of your life tonight'Cause we've got nowhere left to go Show me the freest kind of love tonight All the world will never know, will never knowI sit at home At my desk alone As I used to do On many Sunday afternoons When you came back to me Your arms ached for me And your arms would close me in Though they smelled of other women I think of you on Sunday afternoons I think of you on Sunday afternoons I think of you on Sunday afternoons I think of you on Sunday afternoons Your sweet head would bow Like a child somehow Down to me And your hair and your eyes were wild We would embrace on the floor You see my back's still sore You knew how easily I bruised ItÂ´s a soreness I would never loseLiving in a house near the Black Forest Without any clocks she's begun To listen to the walls her neighbours have clocks Not one but twenty clocks apiece Near the black, black forest Near the black, black forest Near the black, black forest Near the black, black forest Listen to the walls, wind your watch Poor love, poor love, have they caught you By the pendulum  Have they got you stopped Have you already gathered how Living near the Black Forest She gets by on cups of borrowed time Near the black, black forest Near the black, black forest Near the black, black forest Near the black, black forestMy dearest Anne, I am living by a lake With a young man, my dearest Anne His beard is red, his eyes flicker His eyes flicker like a cat's eyes He is like no one I know His cock sinks deep in my heart I have owed you a letter For all these months Anne, my dearest Anne Anne, my dearest Anne Anne, my dearest Anne Anne, my dearest Anne Live or die, you said insistently You chose the second and the first chose me Is love the sugar-coated poison That gets us in the end
