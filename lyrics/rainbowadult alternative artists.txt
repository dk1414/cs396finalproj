Called to the Devil and the Devil did come I said to the Devil, "Devil, do you like drums Do you like cigarettes, dominoes, rum "He said, "Only sundown, Sundays, Christmas"Some days end when I need a few friends Now and again, I could never hope to keep them Thought to give friends what I thought that they wanted Never had they needed a good friend as I've been Don't get me ventin' on friends who resent you'Cause all you've ever done is been a noose to hang on to They thought was a necklace and reckless They fell into Hell where you both hang with nothing to do but Scratch, kick, let gravity win like Fuck this, let gravity win like You could leave it all behind Even the Devil need time alone sometimes You could let it all go You could let it all go It's called "freefall"It's called "freefall"My heart and soul were never mine to own What you care to die for, what you care to die for We die alone, we'll all die young What you care to die for, what you care to die from Snow, snow glistens on the ledge, whiskey on the bed Shake it out and light a cigarette Miss me when you, you wish you weren't right Shake me all out if I'm wrong For you, for you Shake it all out when I'm gone I, for you Is the devil so bad if he cries in his sleep while the earth turns And his kids learn to say, "Fuck you," they don't love you Does the devil get scared if she dies in her dreams while the earth burns She cries 'cause she's nothin' like you, is she like you What you want from a devil like me, devil like me You see, the devil don't mean to be evil He just regrettably forgets to exceed expectation Holes riddled in your head, little bit of lead Shake it out and line a silhouette Miss me when you, you wish weren't kind of gladListen in, it isn't when you're talking for your name's sake Jesus, Mary Magdalene you are, are you okay Sitting by the well, Jill you’re falling down the hill Jack and everybody laughed Don't you pray, don't you pray To a Cocaine Jesus in a black four-seater Got a man, don't need him, but you wait Call me when you want, or just call me when you need it If you only ever need it for the day High won't hold, won't hold And I have no more than all you left of me I have, I have, I have no more than all you leave High as hell, feeling fine, nothing bad but nothing kind Not, not a word from me, at least nothing you would mind In my head, in my head I get lonely sometimes Feeling fly, coming down, never bad cause we're never out You'll never call the cops again, I'll never call her mine In my head, in my head I get lonely sometimesSay we'll get married on a porch in Vegas We can get hitched and have a couple of kids And none of them will look at all like us And our neighbors all be a bit too much And you'll live out in the desert with a man you never loved Is this it What you want What you wanted Do you need love Am I enough for you In time you'll find I've got my baggage too Say we'll get famous and we'll die with our names In every paper, every news report as any consolation To the people that you love and all the people that you hate But we'll love you all the same because you're beautiful Say you didn't see it, that I saw right through you Say you didn't mean it that I mean nothing to you Like you said Do you believe me That I'll be right for you Say you love me like you used to We were born splaying in the wreckage Tearing down on birds with stones I bore my weight upon your shoulders Water as warm as morning suns I don't think quite like I used to I got a bed to call my own I see stars and painted lies Broken glass upon your road Now I'm driving home too soon Woah, woah Say you love me like you used to And we'll vacation first class I'm breaking your fall You're breaking my ass You're working all day Hating on all the bitches at work You say you're okay You're faking, fucked up You're drinking all day, you give me a cup And I'll be damned if we can make it out of this alive, baby I say I'll be damned if we can make it out of this aliveCalled to the Devil and the Devil did come I said to the Devil, "Devil, do you like drums Do you like cigarettes, dominoes, rum "He said, "Only sundown,
