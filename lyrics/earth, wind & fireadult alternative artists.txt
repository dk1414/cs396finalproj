was all we could do We were young and we knew In our eyes, we're alive Deep inside, we knew our love was true For awhile, we paid no mind to the past We knew love would last Every night, something right Would invite us to begin the day Something happened along the way What used to be happy is sad Something happened along the way And yesterday was all we had And, oh, after the love has gone How could you lead me on And not let me stay around Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone What used to be right is wrong Can love that's lost be found For awhile, to love each other with all We would ever need Love was strong for so long Never knew that what was wrong Oh, baby, wasn't right We tried to find what we had'Til sadness was all we shared We were scared This affair would lead our love in twoHearts afire Creates love desire Take you high and higher To the world you belong Hearts afire Creates love desire High and higher To your place on the throne We've come together on this special day Sing a message loud and clear Looking back, we've touched on sorrowful days Future, past, they disappear You will find Peace of mind If you look way down In your heart and soul Ahh, don't
