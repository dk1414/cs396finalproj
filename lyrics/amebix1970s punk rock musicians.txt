Desperation took us down Uneasy lies, the head But where's the crown You can't see it I saw the mourners passing by These wicked men Beneath the sulfurous skies Oh what can it mean Every bell is silent here The hands of clocks are bound And time itself has stopped Can you feel it The birds are frozen in their flight Trapped within the thunder light A storm is rising A voice within the winter halls Some grave secret from these careless lips will fall A star on the horizon See you gods forgotten son Lies broken and alone Searching for a father From Dresden's blazing skies To the bloody wash of dawn I saw the beast arise And climb upon the throne And fallen angels weep And long for peace, for home Whilst far beneath the ice they sleep These dark knights of the black sun And upon stromlashed mountain high I found the hidden book On the altar of the wretched prince of lies And I broke apart the graven seal And these seven words I read Rejoice, the great god fear is dead So from the rooftops calling out You where always free Yes from the rooftops calling out And ever may you beWell, we've all heard the sermon Seen the preachers or worshiped the stage Heard the new manifesto  It's all questions no solutions at all Well, you're out on your own now, always have been Just look at your friends Break the surface to daylight Strength will flow through our unity There is a traitor in our midst And when we rise we will be betrayed They are the wolves in sheep's clothing Take the place at the back of the fold All this talk about freedom Will be tainted with blood Put this cross on your back child Tread the long weary trail to the top of the hill AR IS E  G ET O FF Y OU R K NE ES!There's some hard times coming down There's the smell of revolution on the wind Well, we're grinding down our axes Telling tales round the bonfire at night We will set out with a fire in our hearts When this darkness gives way to the dawn In the light we're united as one For the kingdom of heaven must be taken by storm You're standing on a hill, looking down at the city Thinking 'bout your life and your bottle of pills They released you from the hospital, you're cured!So this is how freedom feels Largactyl Relax Feel a little numb  Feel a little tired Your brain's asleep and your body's retired You've learned to fit in  O BE Y!You're just a shadow of what you used to be Largactyl Relax A comfortable life  A car and a wife It's only a dream but it's fuckin' obscene You've learned to fit in, a vegetable!Senility  At 21 they'll be coming for youYou say that you hear voices, I presume that is correct And you say that all the bad boys end their wicked days in Hell Well if it wasn't for the collar that you wear around your neck You'd be seeing life quite differently, inside a padded cell The fear of God The fear of God Am I to understand you, when you say I'll be forgiven I give you all my money, well that's blackmail don't you see And the ones who give the most are guaranteed a place in heaven Where they can watch the burning souls below and rub their hands with glee The fear of God The fear of God Your priorities are wrong Your faith is blind Crush the weak, uphold the strong Burn the brains of mankindThrough dark Egyptian soil I rise And raise my arms up to the sky I am the life that never ends I am the Logos called again My story ever was the same I was killed by broken men And on the third day rose again I am the God within the grain I am the God of the grain, I’m the God of the grain I am the God of the grain, I live, I die, and I…And so this Cross shall be my sign For I was here before all time I am the center of the flame Every age shall know my name I am the God of the grain, I’m the God of the grain I am the God of the grain, I live, I die, and I…Mithras, Dionysius, Osiris, Adonis Mithras, Dionysius, Osiris, Jesus And I am born again And I am born again!And again!And again!And again!And again The Legion left, and with them took the dying light Once more the land became a wilderness of supertitious night And from the forest deep came tales of children reared by wolves The mother raped and left in shame whilst in the womb They dreamed revenge They are murderous, and they come for us Between the beast and man we die Here come the wolf They are murderous, and they come for us Between the beast and man we die Here come the wolf A message came, a plea for help against the beast But no-one came and night on night the forest rang With chilling cries, as decimation took its course Oh Gods have mercy of our souls, with every night the terror comes See how they run They are murderous, and they come for us Between the beast and man we die Here come the wolf They are murderous, and they come for us At night we hear the children cry Here come the wolfWe came out of the night Bloodied but unbowed from days We always will remember And by the morning light We look upon the risen dawn The day of our creation I see my enemies And I know the way, the way I will defeat them And in such days as these I see the circle turning to completion These days will never come again These days will never come again These days will never come again These days will never come againAxeman Lock up your children, the axeman is coming Lock up your children, the axeman is coming Lock up your children, the axeman is running Lock up your children, he's here He's coming Slaughter He's coming Slaughter He's coming Slaughter He's coming Slaughter Is he from the army or the S.A.S.?Rejected and shunned, left out on his own The skills he acquired are put to the test The ripping of flesh, and the pulping of bone He's coming Slaughter He's coming Slaughter He's coming Slaughter He's coming SlaughterThe parchment of my flesh must break The winter winds my soul doth take And all beneath the heavens lies in peace A world will form and fade away The crystal dawn of the final day Breaks upon the shores of death's release Bring me my flesh and blood On land, the sky, the sea And light a raging fire upon the hearth Gather round 'neath the cloak of time And drink a toast to these Our final days upon this earth We made the deserts from the gardens of our youth We spewed our blackened hearts into the sea Through darkened skies and poisoned clouds We blindly grope for truth We couldn't see the forest for the trees To my wretched son I leave this gun To slaughter all your race For this, the beast you have become I have no longer taste And daughter fair with burning hair The swamp of life be thine And watch as e'en the great will mate With the lowliest of swine To breed the sons, the greed and scum Of this your ravaged land All my estates, both small and great Shall fall beneath your hand
