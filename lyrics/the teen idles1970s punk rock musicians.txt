Life has been the same for a long time Go to school, witness the crimes Go home and see it on the evening news Then we got nothing to do If there were a concert, we would go Usually end up watching primetime shows Hours in front of a T V set We're as idle as teens can get Teen idles, teen idles Fucking bored to tears Teen idles, teen idles Waste of twenty years Teen idles, teen idles Doing nothing all day Teen idles, teen idles Nothing to do anyway Hanging out at the record shops Go to a concert, the boredom stops Went to the Bayou, they said, "No"You're not eighteen, you can't see the show Went to a movie, it was okay Don't wanna do it every day Hours in front of a T V set We're as idle as teens can getYou're sixteen going on thirty-two Confusion of age surrounding you Cigarette dangles from your painted lips You wear the shoe because it fits Put on your sneakers and be a kid Why don't you try and have some fun Put on your sneakers and be a kid You're not fooling anyone Why you wanna grow so old so fast Let your teenage ignorance last Put away all those rings and chains Come back and enjoy the growing pains Put on your sneakers and be a kid Why don't you try and have some fun Put on your sneakers and be a kid You're not fooling anyone, no When I saw you the other day You saw me but turned away Why didn't you acknowledge me Was it cause your date was thirty-three Put on your sneakers and be a kid Why don't you try and have some fun Put on your sneakers and be a kid You're not fooling anyone, noDeadhead, deadhead, take another toke Deadhead, deadhead, you're a lousy joke Friend of the devil, who you trying to kid Friends of the devil are dead like Sid I'll be grateful when you're dead I'll be grateful when you're dead I'll be grateful when you're dead So don't stick around too long Deadhead, deadhead, take another toke Deadhead, deadhead, you're a lousy joke Friend of the devil, who you trying to kid Friends of the devil are dead like Sid I'll be grateful when you're dead I'll be grateful when you're dead I'll be grateful when you're dead So don't stick around too long Riding that train, high on cocaine The music is really lousy, the fans are a pain Troubles behind, troubles ahead The only good Deadhead is one that's dead Deadhead, deadhead, take another toke Deadhead, deadhead, you're a lousy joke Friend of the devil, who you trying to kid Friends of the devil are dead like SidNine o'clock, no stamp on your hand It's hard to rock when you can't see the band You have enough to pay the rates But you can't get in because of your age Minor disturbance, stopped at the door Not new to you, 'cause it's happened before Friends are on the floor, band is on the stage You missed another show because of your age Go down to another part of town Just so they can turn you down Not because of a sold-out house You're not eighteen and that's what counts We're too young to rock We're too young to rockYou keep talking about talent Talent  What do you know Instead of studying theory We're going to get up and go Get up and go Get up and go Get up and go Get up and go A bit too much distortion The feedback hurts your ears You say we need more practice Maybe in a couple of years Get up and go Get up and go Get up and go Get up and go One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight Get up and go Get up and go Get up and go Get up and goFiorucci nightmare, asshole's dream Spend all your money on the fashion machine Spots and stripes and spandex pants Pay a hundred dollars to learn how to dance Spend fifty dollars on a sweater Think it's gonna make you look better See how tight your pants will fit What you gonna do when they start to split Learn your fashion from a magazine Do you really think you're in our dreams Down in Georgetown in a fashion race For the guys to see how high you rateCries of anarchy, cries of freedom Cries of fury in the United Kingdom Started out loud, started out young Started out poor and just for fun Tales of youth fighting back Just another load of crap The clothes you wear have lost their sting So's the fury in the songs you sing Walking with a goose-step, rose up high Making sure you're seen in the public eye You're acting mean, you're acting tough You should have been happy with just enough A loaded pistol at your head You won't be satisfied till you're dead Playing your game, apparent cheap thrills An image to live by, an image that kills There goes your fury, out the door Don't expect our respect anymoreMy vision's clouded, the sun is dark I've lost my way, I've lost my mark Chased by something in another way Hoping to see the light or another day Getting, getting, getting In my way Broad horizons, but my skies are gray Getting, getting, getting In my way Don't know what it is, but it ain't gonna stay Blind punches, invisible blows My patience shortens, my temper grows I'm taking over, I'm not myself I'm tired of the cards I'm being dealt Pissed off as I should I can't do all that I know I could The things I see have different shapes I can't remember what it takesCapitalist society, capitalist pigs Painted faces under plastic wigs You own a fleet of expensive cars Each one has its own well stocked bar Stop eating donuts, start eating beans You look more like a communist if you're lean Put on a hard hat, preferrably red To keep the nightsticks from your head One red-blooded American was known to have said The only good commie is one that's dead Is your favorite color red You don't want money You don't want fame You want everybody to be the same If your plan don't work I'm to blame'Cause I want money and I want fame Eat a yippie, I wanna be rich!You can't call me a hypocrite!I'm sick and tired of being poor!I don't wanna be middle class anymore!One red-blooded American was known to have said The only good commie is one that's dead Is your favorite color red I drink milk, I drink milk, I drink milk, I drink milk I don't care what
