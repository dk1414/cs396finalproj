Yeah, something of a strong wind is coming over me It's got a hold of me, yeah Thinking and doing things I shouldn't be I really I shouldn't be Yeah, but one more call It's the one more “What'cha doing right now ”It's the one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in It's the one more here we go again One more drink leads to another You slide up close to me Tearin' t-shirts off each other Your hands all over me I tell myself I'm not in love But one more time is not enough One last kiss and then you're a goner I'm lyin' here, wishin' you could stay a little longer So calm and so cool, yeah I try to be Like it don't bother me The last time was the last time Until I'm all alone, then I'm picking up the phoneBlame the whiskey on the beer Blame the beer on the whiskey Blame the mornin' on the night For who's lyin' here with me Blame the bar for the band Blame the band for the song Blame the song for the party that went all night long But it ain't my fault No, it ain't my fault Mighta had a little fun Lotta wrong got done But it ain't my fault Blame the heart for the hurtin'Blame the hurtin' on the heart Blame the dark on the devil Blame the devil on the dark Blame the ex for the drinkin'Blame the drinkin' for the ex Blame the two for one tequila's for whatever happens next But it ain't my fault No, it ain't my faultDid I stop and watch the sunset fade What gave me life and took my breath away Did I take a last-call stranger home So I wouldn't have to wake up alone I heard I was a wild one Actin like a child, son But I really don't recall Heard I was a fast one Always was the last one Waitin' for the other shoe to fall I've seen pictures And I've heard stories'Bout the boy I used to be But I don't remember me Was I just another ghost in this town Who was I when no one was around Did I even know what I was livin' without Who are my favorite songs about I heard I was a wild one Actin like a child, son But I really don't recall Heard I was a fast one Always was the last one Waitin' for the other shoe to fall I've seen pictures And I've heard stories'Bout the boy I used to be But I don't remember meNow and then I think about you now and then When I see that Chevrolet That certain shade of blue I hear that song, the one we sang all summer long And even though it's been so long it brings me back Right back to you I hope you find the storm that you were chasing Hope your eyes are still as full of dreams As they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans When I hear the sound of high tide thunder I can see your hair blowing in the breeze I think about how you and that 21 summer made a man of me Yeah, you made a man of me How you been I'd love to hear 'bout how you've been You're the only broken heart I've ever had And love to have again I hope you find the storm that you were chasing Hope your eyes are still as full of dreams As they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans When I hear the sound of high tide thunder I can see your hair blowing in the breeze I think about how you and that 21 summer made a man of me Yeah, you made a man of me Yeah, you made a man of meI can tell that you're lonely Pour it all out on me Because I have been lonely too That's a heartache you're drinkin'And I can feel what you're thinkin'Let's do what the lonely do Your lips, your shoulders and my fingertips Runnin'

love alive'Til I held you close I never felt the feelin'And now I'll feel that way 'til the last sunset goes down You turned a stubborn southern boy into a believer Believe me when I say, it's gonna stay that way 'til they lay me in the ground We'll go on 'til we're pushing up daisies We'll grow old and wild and I'll still be callin' you baby We'll never get enough, we'll be livin' it up right

all goes to hell, the only thing I believe in Is weed, whiskey, and Willie You can take the ring You can take or leave my name You can have my heart It's broken anyway You can take my reputation And drag it through the mud Go on and abuse it But don't take my smoke My jug of brown liquor Or my country music I've got bottles and vinyl stacked to the ceilin'I get stoned for survival, it helps with the healin'And when it all goes to hell, the only thing I believe in Is weed, whiskey, and Willie So turn the music up I'm gonna lock all the doors Turn off the lights and close every blind There ain't nobody home And the pictures on the wall Are just about lost in a cloud of smoke My vices and heroes will hold me together When I'm lettin' you goDon't give me that look, that let me down easy smile Don't act like I couldn't see you coming for a hundred miles Don't try to find the perfect words Can't take the pain out of the hurt Hit me hard, baby I can take it It's your move, go on and make it Make it burn the whole way down Lay my 6 foot 4 inch ass out on the ground Yeah, tomorrow I'll have me a hard hangover And one hell of a heartache So pour it on like a shot of whiskey And shoot me straight I’ve got some friends who'd love to go raise some hell A couple old flames to help me bid you farewell There's plenty of time and alcohol From happy hour, to last call So do what'cha gotta do So I can get to getting over you Make it burn the whole way down Lay my 6 foot 4 inch ass out on the ground Yeah, tomorrow I'll have me a hard hangover And one hell of a heartache So pour it on like a shot of whiskey And shoot me straightEvery thing about you says I should probably get going But everything about me says I wanna stay right here Everybody's got some things better off not knowing That's just the same for us, might be a little dangerous Heard somebody say you're a little heart breaker Sooner or later I'll wake up and you'll be gone The way that you got me feeling right now Got me thinking about how I don't care if they're wrong You can break my heart all night long No, you, you're a little bit trouble No, you, baby that's just fine Because you're easy on my mind Easy on my mind Whoever said nothing good ever happens after midnight Has probably never seen how the moonlight shines on you Let's take a little chance and our romance dancing in the headlights Let's lose track of time, with your skin on mine No, you, you're a little bit trouble No, you, baby that's just fine Because you're easy on my mind Easy on my mind
