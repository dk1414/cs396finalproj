She may be the face I can't forget A trace of pleasure or regret May be my treasure or the price I have to pay She may be the song that summer sings May be the chill that autumn brings May be a hundred different things Within the measure of a day She may be the beauty or the beast May be the famine or the feast May turn each day into a heaven or a hell She may be the mirror of my dreams A smile reflected in a stream She may not be what she may seem Inside her shell She who always seems so happy in a crowd Whose eyes can be so private and so proud No one's allowed to see them when they cry She may be the love that cannot hope to last May come to me from shadows of the past That I'll remember till the day I dieDon't start that talking I could talk all night My mind goes sleepwalking While I'm putting the world to right Call careers information Have you got yourself an occupation Oliver's army is here to stay Oliver's army are on their way And I would rather be anywhere else But here today There was a Checkpoint Charlie He didn't crack a smile But it's no laughing party When you've been on the murder mile Only takes one itchy trigger One more widow, one less white nigga Oliver's army is here to stay Oliver's army are on their way And I would rather be anywhere else But here todayI've been on tenterhooks, ending in dirty looks Listening to the Muzak, thinking 'bout this 'n' that She said that's that, I don't wanna chitter-chat Turn it down a little bit or turn it down flat Pump it up when you don't really need it Pump it up until you can feel it Down in the pleasure center, hell-bent or heaven sent Listen to the propaganda, listen to the latest slander There's nothing underhand that she wouldn't understand Pump it up until you can feel it Pump it up when you don't really need it Hey!She's been a bad girl, she's like a chemical Though you try to stop it, she's like a narcotic You wanna torture her, you wanna talk to her All the things you bought for her, could not get a temperatureOh, my baby, baby I love you more than I can tell I don't think I can live without you And I know that I never will Oh, my baby, baby I want you so it scares me to death I can't say anymore than "I love you"Everything else is a waste of breath I want you You've had your fun, you don't get well no more I want you Your fingernails go dragging down the wall Be careful, darling, you might fall I want you I woke up, and one of us was crying I want you You said: "Young man, I do believe you're dying"I want you If you need a second opinion as you seem to do these days I want you You can look in my eyes and you can count the waysOh, it's so funny to be seeing you after so long, girl And with the way you look, I understand that you are not impressed But I heard you let that little friend of mine Take off your party dress I'm not going to get too sentimental Like those other sticky valentines'Cause I don't know if you were loving somebody I only know it isn't mine Alison, I know this world is killing you Oh, Alison, my aim is true Well, I see you've got a husband now Did he leave your pretty fingers lying in the wedding cake You used to hold him right in your hand I'll bet he took all he could take Sometimes, I wish that I could stop you from talking When I hear the silly things that you say I think somebody better put out the big light'Cause I can't stand to see you this way Alison, I know this world is killing you Oh, Alison, my aim is trueI was tuning in the shine on the light night dial Doing anything my radio advised With every one of those late night stations Playing songs, bringing tears to my eyes I was seriously thinking about hiding the receiver When the switch broke 'cause it's old They're saying things that I can hardly believe They really think we're getting out of control Radio is a sound salvation Radio is cleaning up the nation They say you better listen to the voice of reason But they don't give you any choice'Cause they think that it's treason So you had better do as you are told You better listen to the radio I wanna bite the hand that feeds me I wanna bite that hand so badly I want to make them wish they'd never seen me Some of my friends sit around every evening And they worry about the times ahead But everybody else is overwhelmed by indifference And the promise of an early bed You either shut up or get cut out They don't wanna hear about it It's only inches on the reel-to-reel And the radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools Tryin' to anaesthetize the way that you feelAs I walk through this wicked world Searching for light in the darkness of insanity I ask myself, is all hope lost Is there only pain and hatred and misery And each time I feel like this inside There's one thing I wanna know What's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding Oh, what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding And as I walk on through troubled times My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes So where are the strong and who are the trusted And where is the harmony, sweet harmony 'Cause each time I feel it slipping away Just makes me wanna cry What's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding Oh, what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding History repeats the old conceits The glib replies, the same defeats Keep your finger on important issues With crocodile tears and a pocketful of tissues I'm just the oily slick On the wind-up world of the nervous tick In a very fashionable hovel I hang around, dying to be tortured You'll never be alone in the bone orchard This battle with the bottle is nothing so novel So in this almost-empty gin palace Through a two-way looking glass, you see your Alice You know she has no sins for all your jealousy In a sense, she still smiles very sweetly Charged with insults and flattery Her body moves with malice Do you have to be so cruel to be callous And now, you find you fit this identikit completely You say you have no secrets, then leave discreetly I might make it California's fault Be locked in Geneva's deepest vault Just like the canals of Mars and the Great Barrier Reef I come to you beyond beliefAlmost blue Almost doing things we used to do There's a girl here and she's almost you Almost All the things that your eyes once promised I see in hers too Now your eyes are red from crying Almost blue Flirting with this disaster became me It named me as the fool who only aimed to be Almost blue It's almost touching, it will almost do There is part of me that's always true Always Not all good things come to an end Now it is only a chosen few I've seen such an unhappy couple Almost me Almost you Almost blueCalling Mister Oswald with the swastika tattoo There is a vacancy waiting in the English voodoo Carving 'V' for vandal on the guilty boy's head When he's had enough of that, maybe you'll take him to bed To teach him he's alive 'fore he wishes he was dead Turn up the T V, no one listening will suspect Even your mother won't detect it So your father won't know They think that I've got no respect But everything means less than zero Hey, red Hey, red Oswald and his sister are doing it again They've got the finest home movies that you have ever seen They've got a thousand variations: every service with a smile They're going to take a little break, and they'll be back after a while Well, I hear that South America is coming into style Turn up the T V, no one listening will suspect Even your mother won't detect it So your father won't know They think that I've got no respect But everything means less than zero
