you, love you Love you, love you, love you, love youI seen you go down to a cold mirror It was never clearer in my era so You lick a shine upon your forehead or Check it by the signs in the corridor You light my ways through the club maze We would struggle through the dub daze I see myself in there upon my lover It's how you go down to the men's room sink Sad we talk of how madmen think I see myself in there upon my lover I don't know her from another miss I don't know you from another See me run now you're gone, dream on Why you want to take me to this party and breathe I'm dying to leave

stand by the door, come near me We've been here before, don't fear me Don't stand by the door, come near me Quick thought, left or right Could it be a strong case of fight or flight We'd never know

will leave me Strung out, in need of love Surely I'm as overcome but brimstone won't come to lungs But I ain't done, surely I ain't done Oh, nah, nah, I ain't done Oh, but my mind's on the run Caused

deeper Whose words that I spoke now storm I think it's burning It's climbing deeper, climbing deeper, climbing deeper Climbing deeper, climbing deeper Climbing deeper, climbing deeper Who'll mend this broke beat star Whose strength do I sleep on Climbing deeper, climbing deeper, climbing deeper Who'll mend this broke beat star Whose strength do I speak of Climbing deeper, climbing deeper, climbing

it could be with you Really hurt me, baby, really cut me, baby How can you have a day without a night You're the book that I have opened And now I've got to know much more The curiousness of your potential kiss Has got my mind and body aching Really hurt me, baby, really cut me, baby How can you have a day without a night You're the book that I have opened And now I've got to know much more

to me tightly, I'm a sliding scale Can't endure, then you can't inhale clearly Out of body experience interferes And dreams of flying, I fit nearly Surrounds me, though I get lonely slowly Moving up slowly Inertia keeps She's moving up slowly, slowly Moving up slowly Inertia creeps Moving up slowly She comes Moving up slowly She comes Moving up slowly Inertia creeps Moving up slowly She comes
