Ooh-ooh, ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh I will not make the same mistakes that you did I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk Because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt Because of you I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me Because of you, I am afraid I lose my way And it's not too long before you point it out I cannot cry Because I know that's weakness in your eyes I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life My heart can't possibly break When it wasn't even whole to start withYou're here where you should be Snow is falling as the carolers sing It just wasn't the same Alone on Christmas day Presents, what a beautiful sight Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight You're all that I need Underneath the tree Tonight , I'm gonna hold you close Make sure that you know I was lost before you Christmas was cold and grey Another holiday Alone to celebrate But then , one day Everything changed You're all I need Underneath the tree You're here where you should be Snow is falling as the carolers sing It just wasn't the same Alone on Christmas day Presents, what a beautiful sight Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight You're all that I need Underneath the treeAnd all I remember is your back Walkin' towards the airport, leavin' us all in your past I traveled fifteen hundred miles to see you Begged you to want me, but you didn’t want to But piece by piece, he collected me Up off the ground, where you abandoned things, yeah Piece by piece, he filled the holes That you burned in me at six years old And you know He never walks away, he never asks for money He takes care of me, he loves me Piece by piece, he restored my faith That a man can be kind and a father could stay And all of your words fall flat I made somethin' of myself and now you wanna come back But your love, it isn’t free, it has to be earned Back then I didn’t have anything you needed, so I was worthless But piece by piece, he collected me Up off the ground, where you abandoned things, yeah Piece by piece, he filled the holes That you burned in me at six years old And you know He never walks away, he never asks for money He takes care of me, 'cause he loves me Piece by piece, he restored my faith That a man can be kind and a father could stayHere's the thing, we started out friends It was cool, but it was all pretend Yeah, yeah Since you been gone You're dedicated, you took the time Wasn't long 'til I called you mine Yeah, yeah Since you been gone And all you'd ever hear me say Is how I picture me with you That's all you'd ever hear me say But since you been gone I can breathe for the first time I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah Thanks to you Now I get what I want Since you been gone How can I put it  You put me on I even fell for that stupid love song Yeah, yeah Since you been goneYou know the bed feels warmer Sleepin' here alone You know I dream in color And do the things I want You think you got the best of me Think you've had the last laugh Bet you think that everything good is gone Think you left me broken down Think that I'll come running back Baby, you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong What doesn't kill you makes you stronger Stand a little taller Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone What doesn't kill you makes a fighter Footsteps even lighter Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger Just me, myself, and I What doesn't kill you makes you stronger Stand a little taller Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm aloneDa-da-da, un, da-da Da-da-da, un, da-da Da-da-da, un, da-da-da-da Da-da-da, un, da-da Da-da-da, un, da-da Da-da-da, un, da-da-da-da Grew up in a small town And when the rain would fall down I'd just stare out my window Dreamin' of what could be And if I'd end up happy I would pray Trying hard to reach out But when I tried to speak out Felt like no one could hear me Wanted to belong here But something felt so wrong here So I prayed I could break away I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change And break away Out of the darkness and into the sun But I won't forget all the ones that I love I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change And break awayHey Every kiss is a door Can I knock on yours  Can we knock a little more If your touch is a key Keep on twistin', keep unlockin', keep on turnin' me Let me in I wanna be closer to you, let you under my skin If I let you in You gotta be careful with it Let me tell you again Love so soft, you ain't had nothin' softer Break it, then you buy it, and it sure gonna cost ya Love so soft that you can't rub off You gon' love it, if you try it Got you hooked, now you're caught up Love so soft, so soft Love so soft, so soft If a thought was the truth We'd be doin' all the kinds of things I know you wanna do But I need, need to know Will you protect me, respect me if I let you close There are moments that the words don't reach There is suffering too terrible to name You hold your child as tight as you can Then push away the unimaginable The moments when you're in so deep Feels easier to just swim down And so they move uptown And learn to live with the unimaginable I spend hours in the garden I walk alone to the store And it's quiet uptown I never liked the quiet before I take the children to church on Sunday A sign of the cross at the door And I pray That never used to happen before If you see him in the street, walking by himself Talking to himself, have pity You would like it uptown, it's quiet uptown He is working through the unimaginable His hair has gone grey, he passes every day They say he walks the length of the city You knock me out, I fall apart Can you imagine Remember all the things we wanted Now all our memories, they're haunted We were always meant to say goodbye Even with our fists held high It never would've worked out right, yeah We were never meant for do or die I didn't want us to burn out I didn't come here to hurt you, now I can't stop I want you to know that it doesn't matter Where we take this road Someone's gotta go And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better But I want you to move on So I'm already gone Looking at you makes it harder But I know that you'll find another That doesn't always make you wanna cry It started with a perfect kiss then We could feel the poison set in"Perfect" couldn't keep this love alive You know that I love you so, I Love you enough to let you go I want you to know that it doesn't matter Where we take this road Someone's gotta go And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better But I want you to move on So I'm already gone I'm already gone, already gone You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong I'm already gone, already gone There's no moving on, so I'm already gone Ahh, already gone, already gone, already gone Ahh, already gone, already gone, already gone, yeah Remember all the things we wanted Now all our memories, they're haunted We were always meant to say goodbyeWhen you're lost in the moment You can't see where you're goin'I didn’t know who I could trust So I put all my faith in us Oh, you tore me to pieces Turned my strength into weakness I didn't want it all to fall apart So I decided just to play the part But honestly, I'd do it all again Puttin' up with all the bullshit It made me strong enough to do this It used to bother me, thought I could never leave After all that I've been through, nothin' left to prove No, no, no, I don't think about you Weighing down on me I lost my sanity And now that we are through, nothin' left to lose No, no, no, I don't think about you I feel freedom where I stand now And I feel proud of who I am now Yeah, I learned a lot along the way I love the woman that I became
