A year from now we'll all be gone All our friends will move away And they're goin' to better places But our friends will be gone away Nothin' is as it has been And I miss your face like hell And I guess it's just as well But I miss your face like hell Ohhh uh oh uhhhh oh Ohhh uh oh uhhhh oh Been talkin' 'bout the way things change And my family lives in a different state If you don't know what to make of this Then we will not relate So if you don't know what to make of this Then we will not relate Ohhh uh oh uhhhh oh Ohhh uh oh uhhhh oh Ohhh uh oh uhhhh oh Ohhh uh oh uhhhh ohHoneybee Could you imagine where our lives would lead That silly ring, it wasn't meant to be Luckily, you saw in me something I couldn't see Honeybee I can't imagine how my life would be If all your gravity did not hit me Oh, don't you see  Darling, my honeybee But here we are After all the messes and confessions To the stars That we never really owned as ours And if our world comes tumbling down I never could forgive myself for leaving out You're the one, you are the only one Such a fool I took your love and I bent all the rules You took the blow and didn't let it show Stuck around to let me know Built a family of our own Look around We made a garden of the love we found So many reasons I would fight to stay You're the courage when I fade Take a look at what we've madeWhen I wake up in the morning I see nothing For miles and miles and miles When I sleep in the evening, oh lord There she goes, only in dreams She's only in dreams Well, well my love We've been here before Don't drag me through this again We tried everything under the sun Now I'm trying to wake up from this I'm trying to make up for it All we ever do is all we ever knew La la la la la la La la la la la la La la la la la La la la la la la La la la la la la La la la la laPut your dreams away for now I won't see you for some time I am lost in my mind I get lost in my mind Momma once told me"You're already home where you feel loved,"I am lost in my mind I get lost in my mind Oh my brother Your wisdom is older than me Oh my brother Don’t you worry ‘bout me Don’t you worry Don’t you worry Don’t worry about me How’s that bricklaying coming How’s your engine running Is that bridge getting built Are your hands getting filled Won’t you tell me, my brother 'Cause there are stars up above We can start moving forward How’s that bricklaying coming How’s your engine running Is that bridge getting built Are your hands getting filled Won’t you tell me, my brother 'Cause there are stars up above We can start moving forwardThese are just flames Burning in your fireplace I hear your voice and it seems As if it was all a dream I wish it was all a dream I see a world A world turning in on itself Are we just like Hungry wolves howling in the night I don't want no music tonight Can we go on like it once was Every time I hear another story Oh the poor boy lost his head Everybody feels a little crazy But we go on living with it Yeah, they go on living with it These are just flames Burning in your fireplace I hear your voice and it seems As if it was all a dream I wish it was all a dreamI wish I was a slave to an age-old trade Like ridin' around on railcars and workin' long days Lord have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways Lord have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways Call it one drink too many Call it pride of a man But it don't make no difference if you sit or you stand Cause they both end in trouble and start with a grin Yeah they both end in trouble and start with a grin We do it over and over and over again We do it over and over and over again Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh I know there's California, Oklahoma And all of the places I ain't ever been to but Down in the valley with Whiskey rivers These are the places you will find me hidin'These are the places I will always go These are the places I will always goDrawn to the sorta library magic Whispering through the dusty aisles Watching all the thinkers read Trying to keep a grown man quiet's like Pulling teeth on a winters eve Cracks and poles and unfamiliar roads I'm on this one to find out As you'd guess, some brothers arrest Can't stay healthy in the cloud of eyes Listening to my every move Just trying to survive Self-imposed adventure that selfishness drives I can barely keep my head above the blue Trying to keep it off me and you And I can see the sunshine's rays Gleaming through the clear water Telling me what happened before This chapter's arrived There will always be better days There will always be better daysOh, oh Oh, oh A heart-shaped tree standing in between Human nature, and the nature we see Wouldn't you know it now Life's got a funny way of showing us how I see you standing there, listening in the leaves Looking down, shining on me Trying to show me how, just takes a while You should know this by now Until you learn to love yourself The door is locked to someone else I'm just as damaged as you are Scattered to pieces with you gone Without the dark, there is no light But don't give the ghost an inch tonight I saw the signs you were leaving But I didn't wanna believe it This could be so easy If you could see you through my eyes I tell myself not to let it go Hold on to something so beautiful This could be so easy If you could see you through my eyes I tell myself not to let it go Hold on to something so beautifulIf I never come through Yes, it haunts me Sunny days, I'd miss you Yes, it haunts me First you see it, then you feel it, now I'm caught And we're making our own thing Now I'm following you out to the coast If I never come through If I never come through Don't tell me I lost a step Criss-crossed in the wrong direction Found myself in a conversation From a missed connection Standing there in a purple dress Point my eyes in the right direction Find myself in a conversation From a missed connection La-la-la-la, la-la-la La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la La-la-la-la, la-la-la La-la-la-la-la From a missed connectionThere were times you should have stalled As you sailed into the fog Like a dog I smelled your fear Lord knows you should have been here with me But you were gone These days roll sleepily by I can hear the old trains cry There will always be be a moon Pulling me away from you You're gone, gone, gone, gone Gone are the days when the wind would brush my face Gone are the days when you're the wind...And gone are the days when my heavy heart is worn on my sleeve Ooooo ooo ooo ooo ooo Take back your pictures Take back your letters Don't send me send postcards Telling me you miss me Cause I'm trying here!I'm trying here
