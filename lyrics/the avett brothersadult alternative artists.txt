Load the car and write the note Grab your bag and grab your coat Tell the ones that need to know We are headed north One foot in and one foot back It don't pay to live like that So I cut the ties and I jumped the tracks For never to return Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in Are you aware the shape I'm in My hands, they shake, my head, it spins Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in When at first I learned to speak I used all my words to fight With him and her and you and me Oh, but it's just a waste of time It's such a waste of time That woman she's got eyes that shine Like a pair of stolen polished dimes She asked to dance I said it's fine I'll see you in the morning timeThere’s a darkness upon me that’s flooded in light In the fine print they tell me what’s wrong and what’s right And it comes in black and it comes in white And I’m frightened by those that don’t see it When nothing is owed or deserved or expected And your life doesn’t change by the man that’s elected If you’re loved by someone, you’re never rejected Decide what to be and go be it There was a dream and one day I could see it Like a bird in a cage I broke in and demanded that somebody free it And there was a kid with a head full of doubt So I’ll scream til I die and the last of those bad thoughts are finally out There’s a darkness upon you that’s flooded in light And in the fine print they tell you what’s wrong and what’s right And it flies by day and it flies by night And I’m frightened by those that don’t see it There was a dream and one day I could see it Like a bird in a cage I broke in and demanded that somebody free it And there was a kid with a head full of doubt So I’ll scream til I die and the last of those bad thoughts are finally outWhen my body won't hold me anymore And it finally lets me free Will I be ready When my feet won't walk another mile And my lips give their last kiss goodbye Will my hands be steady when I lay down my fears, my hopes, and my doubts The rings on my fingers, and the keys to my house With no hard feelings When the sun hangs low in the west And the light in my chest won't be kept held at bay any longer When the jealousy fades away And it's ash and dust for casual lust And it's just hallelujah And love in thoughts and love in the words Love in the songs they sing in the church And no hard feelings Lord knows they haven't done much good for anyone Kept me afraid and cold With so much to have and hold Mmm, hmmYou were a friend to me when my wheels were off the tracks And though you say there is no need I intend to pay you back When my mind was turning loose and all my thoughts were turning black You shined a light on me And I intend to pay you back But I still wake up, shaken by dreams And I hate to say it, but the way it seems Is that no one is fine Take the time, to peel a few layers And you will find True sadness When I was a child I depended on a bottle Full grown I've been known to lean on a bottle But you're the real deal in a world of imposters And I've seen the program make men out of monsters Cause I still wake up, shaken by dreams And I hate to say it, but the way it seems Is that no one is fine Take the time, to peel a few layers And you will find True sadnessThere ain't no man-can save me There ain't no man-can enslave me Ain't no man or men that can change the shape my soul is in There ain't nobody here who can cause me pain or raise my fear Cause I got only love to share If you're looking for truth I'm proof you'll find it there You got to serve something, ain't that right I know it gets dark, but there's always a light You don't have to buy in to get into the club Trade your worries You gotta show up if you wanna be seen If it matters to you ma', it matters to me I'm going to fall hard, yeah I know I am When the clowns crack up, I laugh with them There ain't no man-can save me There ain't no man-can enslave me Ain't no man or men that can change the shape my soul is in There ain't nobody here who can cause me pain or raise my fear Cause I got only love to share If you're looking for truth I'm proof you'll find it thereIt's a fake, it's a hoax It's a nowhere road where no one goes Anywhere, anyhow Well you're followin' your heart rate down She's a rose, she's a queen But she's starin' at a magazine In the dark, on the path Where they doctor every photograph Another is waiting She isn't saying anything If you care, if you like Well, I'm standing in the lantern light With our weapons and our love And I use them both to cover up But I love you and I care So you got to get off that conveyor belt If I could I would come right in and take you off myselfBum-bum, bum-ba-dum-ba-dum Bum-bum, bum-ba-dum-ba-dum Bum-bum, bum-ba-dum-ba-dum, dum Bum-bum, bum-ba-dum-ba-dum Bum-bum, bum-ba-dum-ba-dum Bum-bum, bum-ba-dum-ba-dum, dum You're long and strong like a railway trestle Dad's just a muscle and mama just a vessel Meant to call, fawn over, nuzzle and nestle But dad's just a bear you can tackle down and wrestle Son, give me time I'm a bona fide mess'll If mama says no, maybe dad'll say yes'll Did you do wrong  Well, go ahead, confess'll Dad just a muscle and mama just a vessel You all blue and your mama like a rattle Came out looking like a Smurf in a battle Me in the nosebleeds, mama in the saddle Brave like a Sioux brave going into battle Emotion going like a stampede of cattle Real like rain and coffee in Seattle Anesthesiologist fiddle and faddle You all blue and your mama like a rattleI don't write 'cause I don't think I don't have a need to speak I don't see the bright side, quite as clear Accolades and happy days They don't ever last Stories of courage clouded up with fear In the broom grass I would l lie Glimmer in my eye, the sun smiled back on me From Victory, I tried To match eternal light with how I lead my life Of course, I was forced to retreat From victory I accept defeat Waxy green and yellow walls Outside my windows fall Covering the light I thought I'd see Am I sad or am I sick What's at the root of it Do I throw my hands and quit Something tells me no In the broom grass I would l lie Glimmer in my eye, the sun smiled back on me From victory, I tried To match eternal light with how I lead my life Of course, I was forced to retreat From victory I accept defeatAll it'll take is just one moment And you can say goodbye to how we had it planned Fear like a habit, run like a rabbit out and away Through the screen door to the unknown And I wanna love you and more I wanna find you and more Where do you reside When you hide, how can I find you Cause I wanna send you and more I wanna tempt you and more Can you tell that I am alive Let me prove it You and I, we're the same Live and die, we're the same Hear my voice, know my name You and I, we're the same Live like a pharaoh, sing like a sparrow anyway Even if there is no land or love in sight We bloom like roses, lead like Moses out and away Through the bitter crowd to the daylightIf I get murdered in the city Don't go revengin' in my name One person dead from such is plenty No need to go get locked away When I leave your arms The things that I think of No need to get over-alarmed I'm comin' home I wonder which brother is better Which one our parents love the most I sure did get in lots of trouble They seem to let the other go A tear fell from my father's eyes I wondered what my Dad would say He said, "I love you and I'm proud of you both In so many different ways."If I get murdered in the city Go read the letter in my desk Don't bother with all my belongings Pay attention to the list Make sure my sister knows I loved her Make sure my mother knows the same Always remember there was nothing worth sharing Like the love that let us share our name Always remember there was nothing worth sharing Like the love that let us share our name
