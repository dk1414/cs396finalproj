leaned back on my radio Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll"Lotta soul," he said Then the loud sound did seem to fade Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase That weren't no D J, that was hazy cosmic jive There's a starman waiting in the sky He'd like to come and meet us But he thinks he'd blow our minds There's a starman waiting in the sky He's told us not to blow it'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile He told me Let the children lose it Let the children use it Let all the children boogie I had to phone someone, so I picked on you Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too Switch on the T V, we may pick him up on Channel Two Look out your window, I can see his light If we can sparkle, he may land tonight Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in frightI, I will be king And you, you will be queen Though nothing will drive them away We can beat them, just for one day We can be heroes, just for one day And you, you can be mean And I, I'll drink all the time'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact Yes, we're lovers, and that is that Though nothing will keep us together We could steal time, just for one day We can be heroes, forever and ever What d'you

villa of Ormen, in the villa of Ormen Stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah In the centre of it all, in the centre of it all Your eyes On the day of execution, on the day of execution Only women kneel and smile, ah-ah, ah-ah At the centre of it all, at the centre of it all Your eyes, your eyes​Ah-ah-ah Ah-ah-ah In the villa of Ormen, in the villa of Ormen Stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah At the centre of it all, at the centre of it all Your eyes, your eyes Ah-ah-ah Something happened on the day he died Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried How many times does an angel fall How many people lie instead of talking tall He trod on sacred ground, he cried loud into the crowd​I can't answer why Just go with me I'ma take you home Take your passport and shoes And your sedatives, boo You're a flash in the pan I'm the Great I Am ​I'm a blackstar, way up, on money, I've got game I see right, so wide, so open-hearted pain I want eagles in my daydreams, diamonds in my eyes Something happened on the day he died Spirit rose a metre then stepped aside Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried I can't answer why But I can tell you how We were born upside-down Born the wrong way 'round I'm a blackstar, I'm not a gangstar I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar I'm not a pornstar, I'm not a wandering star I'm a blackstar, I’m a blackstarIt's a god-awful small affair To the girl with the mousy hair But her mummy is yelling, "No!"And her daddy has told her to go But her friend is nowhere to be seen Now she walks through her sunken dream To the seat with the clearest view And she's hooked to the silver screen But the film is a saddening bore For she's lived it ten times or more She could spit in the eyes of fools As they ask her to focus on Sailors fighting in the dance hall Oh, man, look at those cavemen go It's the freakiest show Take a look at the lawman Beating up the wrong guy Oh, man, wonder if he'll ever know He's in the best selling show Is there life on Mars Look up here, I'm in heaven I've got scars that can't be seen I've got drama, can't be stolen Everybody knows me now Look up here, man, I'm in danger I've got nothing left to lose I'm so high, it makes my brain whirl Dropped my cell phone down below Ain't that just like me By the time I got to New York I was living like a king There I used up all my money I was looking for your ass This way or no way, you know I'll be free Just like that bluebird now, ain't that just like me Oh, I'll be free, just like that bluebird Oh, I'll be free, ain't that just like me Oh yeah Mmm Still don't know what I was waiting for And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets and Every time I thought I'd got it made It seemed the taste was not so sweet So I turned myself to face me But I've never caught a glimpse Of how the others must see the faker I'm much too fast to take that test Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes Ch-ch-changes, don't want to be a richer man Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes Ch-ch-changes, just gonna have to be a different man Time may change me But I can't trace time Oh yeah I watch the ripples change their size But never leave the stream of warm impermanence and So the days float through my eyes But still the days seem the same And these children that you spit on As they try to change their worlds Are immune to your consultations They're quite aware of what they're going throughWe passed upon the stair We spoke of was and when Although I wasn't there He said I was his friend Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes"I thought you died alone A long, long time ago"Oh no, not me I never lost control You're face to face With the man who sold the world I laughed and shook his hand And made my way back home I searched for form and land For years and years, I roamed I gazed a gazely stare At all the millions here We must have died alone A long, long time agoI'm an alligator, I'm a mama-papa coming for you I'm a space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you Keep your mouth shut, you're squawking like a pink monkey bird And I'm busting up my brains for the words Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe Put your ray gun to my head Press your space face close to mine, love Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah Don't fake it, baby, lay the real thing on me The church of man, love, is such a holy place to be Make me, baby, make me know you really care Make me jump into the air Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe Put your ray gun to my head Press your space face close to mine, love Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe Put your ray gun to my head Press your space face close to mine, love Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh-Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe Put your ray gun to my head Press your space face close to mine, love Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
