I'm not going away Like you watched at fourteen as it went down the drain And pops stayed the same and your moms moved away How many of our parents seem to make it anyway We're just fumbling through the grey Trying find a heart that's not walking away Turn the lights down low Walk these halls alone We can feel so far from so closeIt's undeniable how brilliant you are In an unreliable world you shine like a star It's unforgettable now that we've come this far It's unmistakable that you're undeniable February 5th, Friday morning, purple dawn Broke a yawn, as I stepped through the fog, like I stepped to a song A moment like a poem, you wish you could hold it I shut my eyes like it's frozen, it's gone when I open It slipped past the clouds right there where it lingered Like your band and a girl could slip through your fingers My feet hit the ground like a beat for the lonely On a path beaten down by the crowds in the morning If only I could touch past the phony If only they were there now to hold me As the questions keep droning You're the only one who stuck it out last night The only other one who caught the other line You're the only one when this world collides The one that I can't deny It's undeniable how brilliant you are In an unreliable world you shine like a star It's unforgettable now that we've come this far It's unmistakable that you're undeniableMy girl money like payday I could sit and watch her all day P-town sippin' lattes We were North just before Kanye You're my queen like yoncé She gonna say what she wanna say Paris all the way to Paraguay Come with me Hail Mary like Elway Cause I miss her in the mornin' when I'm gone And I call from a different timezone Birthdays to champagne to chill days Doesn't matter, I'm sold My girl is money, money Dollar, dollar bill My girl is money, money Dollar, dollar bill Ain't nothin' like her, nah, nah, nah Can't live without her, nah, nah, nah My girl is money, money Dollar, dollar bill Dollar, dollar bill y'allI used to worry about nothing Said I'd never grow up, and I fell in love and it was enough until it wasn't I used to dream that we could make it But now I'm workin' on a paycheck And the voice on the line says I'm doing fine Can you tell that I'm faking And we watched our friends play the same old game And we all pretend that we're okay When we wanna say Take me back to the time when getting old was turning twenty-five The single C D that you burned me, you playеd it back The way we laugh, windows down Rolling 'round the south sidе of town On your flip phone, you told your dad, no, you wouldn't crash Maybe we went too fast In your Pontiac My mama worried about my marriage But now I'm worried about my parents You could try to run from what runs in your blood But you still gotta share itBorn and raised Under the rain and a Western Wind Felt the weight Trying to live up to they say I am Is it any wonder Shame comes calling my first name Is there any question If I'm the one here left to blame It's the same fight all over again It's the same bite breaking on my skin It's the same light when you let me in You let me in, You let me in You are the air I breathe You are the song I bleed You are the war that I can't win This is my white flag in the wind Every word You speak Is the air I breathe I feel like a contender Bringing my fist to pistol war I surrender That I need you now and You've loved me more It's like an ocean over my head and I'm under the light In slow mo-o-o-o-o-otion tonightShe got the call today One out of the grey And when the smoke cleared It took her breath away She said she didn't believe It could happen to me I guess were all one phone call from our knees We're gonna get there soon If every building falls And all the stars fade We'll still be singing this song The one they can't take away We're gonna get there soon She's gonna be there too Cryin' in her room Prayin' Lord come through We're gonna get there soon Oh, it's your light Oh, it's your way Pull me out of the dark Just to show me the way Cryin' out now From so far away You pull me closer to love Closer to love
