Blows, and flows of angel hair And ice cream castles in the air And feathered canyons everywhere I've looked at clouds that way But now they only block the sun They rain and snow on everyone So many things I would've done But clouds got in my way I've looked at clouds from both sides now From up and down and still somehow It's cloud's illusions I recall I really don't know clouds at all Moons, and tunes and Ferris wheels The dizzy, dancing way you feel When every fairy tale comes real I've looked at love that way But now it's just another show You leave them laughing when you go And if you care, don't let them go Don't give yourself away I've looked at love from both sides now From win and lose and still somehow It's love's illusions I recall I really don't know love at allI took your picture on the day we met You gave me a smile, so I told you my name It was a summer I will never forget You told me you loved me, I told you the same We had fun for a little while But right away, I knew it could never last In five days I'd be back at school I never knew five days could go by so fast And when the sun went down you kissed me one last time It felt just like a photograph, a picture in my mind Now all I have is the memory, it seem so long ago But tonight, I feel like you are here with me As I sit here alone, looking at pictures of you Sometimes when I think of you It makes me smile all over again I wonder if you ever think of me too Or if you remember my name'Cause when you held me tight, and kissed me one last time It felt just like a photograph, a picture in my mind Now all I have is the memory, it seems so long agoOn the floors of Tokyo Or down in London town to go-go With the record selection And the mirrors reflection I'm a dancing with myself When there's no one else in sight In the crowd and lonely night Well I wait so long For my love vibration And I'm dancing with myself Oh oh oh dancing with myself Oh oh oh dancing with myself Well there's nothing to lose And there's nothing to prove I'll be dancing myself Oh oh, oh oh If I looked all over the world And there's every type of girl But your empty eyes Seem to pass me by Leave me dancing myself So let's sink another drink'Cause it'll give me time to think If I had the chance I'd ask the world to dance And I'll be dancing with myselfWoahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yea Woahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yea When i was a little girl My best friend in the whole wide world Was my little rubber toy It used to bring me so much joy Floating in my bubble bath It's funny noises always made me laugh Splashing water all over the floor I never thought i could ask for more But now i'm tired of my little friend I was young and that was just pretend Now i'm ready for something new And if your lucky then it could be you You could be my squeeze toy You could be my squeeze toy Come and play with me boy Won't you be my squeeze toy You could be with me boy Everynight when my mother said I took my squeeze toy up to bed And in the morning each and every day I took my friend outside to play Always with me when i went to school Even though it was against the rules All my teachers told me it was wrong For little girls to play with toys so long But now it's time to put my toys away And have fun in a different way Cause i'm ready for something new And if your lucky then it could be youTurn the bass up high turn the lights down low Party people in the place know it's time to go But there's one more thing that you've got to know Gonna party all night till we lose control Turn the bass up high turn the lights down low Party people in the place know it's time to go But there's one more thing that you've got to know Gonna party all night till we lose control If you knew what's on my mind We'd be funkin' all the time baby Once I get you on the floor You'll be callin' out for more tonight Cause there ain't no party Like a Boomtang party, that's right Everybody scream and shout Gonna turn this mutha out tonight I've got 59 ways to move ya59 ways to get through to ya And only one chance to lose ya'Never know just what you'll find When I open up your mind baby Gonna slip inside your veins Put the funk into your brain tonight Put your hands in the sky Gonna get you so high -
