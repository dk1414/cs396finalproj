6:00am, day after Christmas I throw some clothes on in the dark The smell of cold, car seat is freezing The world is sleeping, I am numb Up the stairs to her apartment She is balled up on the couch Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte They're not home to find us out And we drive Now that I have found someone I'm feeling more alone Than I ever have before She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly They call her name at 7:30 I pace around the parking lot Then I walk down to buy her flowers And sell some gifts that I got1, 2, 3, 4!So you wanted To take a break Slow it down some And have some space Well, fuck you too Give me my money back Give me my money back You bitch I want my money back And don't forget Don't forget To give me back my black T-shirt I wish I hadn't Bought you dinner Right before you Dumped me on your front porch Give me my money back Give me my money back You bitch I want my money back And don't forget Don't forget To give me back my black T-shirtDarren: I was never cool in school I'm sure you don't remember me Robert: And now it's been ten years I'm still wondering who to be Ben: But I'd love to mix in circles, cliques, and social coteries That's me Darren: Hand me my nose ring!Robert: Show me the mosh pit!All: We can be happy underground I've got this pain in my heart, that's all Well there's got to be something else Let me tell you something else There was a girl that passed me by She gave a smile but I was shy and I looked down So down But now there's a place to go It's the morning now, it's the evening, it's everything I click my heels and I'm thereWon't you look up at the skyline At the mortar, block, and glass And check out the reflections in my eyes See they always used to be there Even when this all was grass And I sang and danced about a high-rise And you were laughing at my helmet hat Laughing at my torch Go ahead you can laugh all you want I got my philosophy And I trust it like the ground That's why my philosophy Keeps me walking when I'm falling down I see that there is evil And I know that there is good And the in-betweens I never understood Would you look at me I'm crazy But I get the job done Yeah, I'm crazy but I get the job doneWhat was our home Paper, not stone A lean-to, at most And when you pulled Your half away Gravity won Like it always does Did I weigh a ton Would it be easier To just delete Our pages and the plans we made Erase me, so you don't have to face me Put me in the ground and mow the daisies Ah, the memory See how it goes when you—Erase me Erase me So what will you do With no me for you I know what we said What if I left A thing or two We know that you don't seem To think about what you need'Til you reach to find that you've—Well I thought about the army Dad said, "Son, you're fuckin' high"And I thought, yeah there's a first for everything So I took my old man's advice Three sad semesters It was only 15 grand spent in bed I thought about the army I dropped out and joined a band instead Grew a mustache and a mullet Got a job at Chick-Fil-A Citing artistic differences The band broke up in May And in June reformed without me And they'd got a different name I nuked another grandma's apple pie And hung my head in shame, oh I've been thinkin' a lot today I've been thinkin' a lot today Oh, I think I'll write a screenplay Oh, I think I'll take it to L A Oh, I think I'll get it done yesterday, ah, shitI Said what you wanted to hear And what I Wanted to say So I will take it back And all the dishes intact Let them be Broken Broken It's easy to be Easy and free When it doesn't mean anything You remain selfless, cold And composed You've done me no Favor to call and be nice Telling me I Can take anything ILike You don't owe me to be so polite You've done no wrong You've done no wrong Get out of my sightHoward,The strangest things Have happened lately when I Take a good swing At all my dreams They pivot and slip I drop my fists and they're back Laughing, Howard My intention's become not to lose what I've won Ambition has given way to desperation and I Lost the fight from my eyes Boxing's been good to me, Howard Now I'm told, "you're growing old"The whole time you knew A couple of years I'd be through Has boxing been good to you Howard, now I confess I'm scared and lonely and tired They seem to think I'm made of clay Another day I'm not cut out for this I just know what to say I sayYou might put your love and trust on the line It's risky, people love to tear that down, let 'em try Do it anyway Risk it anyway And if you're paralyzed by a voice in your head It's the standing still that should be scaring you instead Go on and do it anyway Do it anyway There'll be times you might leap before you look There'll be times you'll like the cover and that's precisely why you'll love the book Do it anyway Do it anyway Tell me what I said I'd never do Tell me what I said I'd never say Read me off a list of the things I used to not like, but now I think are okay Sometimes it's not subjective wrong and right Deep down you know it's downright wrong but you're invincible tonight So you do it anyway It's done, you did itStop the bus I wanna be lonely When seconds pass slowly And years go flying by You gotta stop the bus I'll get off here Enough's enough I'm leaving this factory All she wants Is food on the table I won't be able To bring it home No I won't, come on'Cause all l need, yeah is free'Cause I'm a factory Did Mother Nature tell you Boy you come and go as you please That's what she said to me But Big Brother got the keys And I got Jackson Cannery
