Let me know that I've done wrong When I've known this all along I go around a time or two Just to waste my time with you Tell me all that you've thrown away Find out games you don't wanna play You are the only one That needs to know I'll keep you my dirty little secret Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret My dirty little secret, who has to know When we live such fragile lives It's the best way we survive I go around a time or two Just to waste my time with you Tell me all that you've thrown away Find out games you don't wanna play You are the only one That needs to knowI wake up every evenin'With a big smile on my face And it never feels outta place And you're still probably workin'At a 9 to 5 pace I wonder how bad that tastes When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell Now where's your picket fence, love And where's that shiny car And did it ever get you far You never seemed so tense, love I've never seen you fall so hard Yeah, do you know where you are And truth be told, I miss you And truth be told, I'm lyin'When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell I hope it gives you hellYour subtleties, they strangle me I can't explain myself at all And all the wants and all the needs All I don't want to need at all The walls start breathing, my mind's unweaving Maybe it's best you leave me alone A weight is lifted on this evening I give the final blow When darkness turns to light It ends tonight, it ends tonight A falling star, at least I fall alone I can't explain what you can't explain You're finding things that you didn't know I look at you with such disdain The walls start breathing, my mind's unweaving Maybe it's best you leave me alone A weight is lifted on this evening I give the final blowGo ahead as you waste your days with thinking When you fall, everyone stands Another day and you've had your fill of sinking With the life held in your Hands are shaking cold These hands are meant to hold Speak to me When all you gotta keep is strong Move along, move along like I know ya do And even when your hope is gone Move along, move along just to make it through Move along Move along So a day when you've lost yourself completely Could be a night when your life ends Such a heart that will lead you to deceiving All the pain held in your Hands are shaking cold Your hands are mine to hold Speak to meDays swiftly come and go I'm dreaming of her She's seeing other guys Emotions astir The sun is gone The nights are long And I am left while the tears fall Did you think that I would cry On the phone Do you know what it feels like Being alone I'll find someone new Swing, swing from the tangles of My heart is crushed by a former love Can you help me find a way to carry on again Wish cast into the sky I'm moving on Sweet beginnings do arise She knows I was wrong The notes are old They bend, they fold And so do I to a new loveThere's a place Somewhere that's between dream and awake That's where we'll find each other And I know that that sounds stupid, but it'll give us both something to find When we were kids All run-and-gun and back-talk kind of kids We'd get drunk out on the sidewalk And we'd laugh ourselves home We used to do that kinda shit all the time And what I fight today, I always keep those yesterdays in my mind All I want, wanted Is to be want, wanted by you Cause when goodbyes Get easy, weâ€™ll all be alone But why God, why Can't this one just be even though That I'm gearing up for this battle Even if I know that I may never winMaybe I'm a bad seed Blame it on the T VAnd maybe it was just because my grandma raised me Tell me what all this is Yeah, tell me what honesty is You need a body cast for all my broken promises Told you not to hold your breath You're turning blue the way I make you Sweat  Sweat  Sweat!I'm making you Sweat, sweat, sweat I'm making you Sweat  Sweat  Sweat!I'm making you Sweat, sweat, sweat I'm not a basic dude But I'm just a waste of you I know it's hard to face the music that I play to you Like I'm dropping a bomb Go and cry to your momma Life is such a comedy, so just spare me the dramaFrom the tongue, it slips some simple twist of fate To shape and shake the room we were standing in And I remember then the silence made me weightless In the tonic of you once again Where ignorance was bliss Ignorance was this place we could exist and then surrender Do you remember The day you said it That's when I knew, that's when I knew, that's when I knew I'll never forget it The day you said it That's when I knew, that's when I knew, that's when I knew I'll make you regret it Now I'm staring at the ceiling wide awake Man, shit gets real when you're alone There's these voices in my head They're screaming words I should've said But I don't know I can't let go And you are down Your taste was in my mouth The lipstick on the window You were goneYou don't have to move You don't have to speak Lips for biting You're staring me down A glance makes me weak Eyes for striking Now I'm twisted up When I'm twisted with you Brush so lightly And time trickles down And I'm breathing for two Squeeze so tightly I'll be fine, you'll be fine This moment seems so long Don't waste now, precious time We'll dance inside the song What makes the one to shake you down Each touch belongs to each new sound Say now you want to shake me too Move down to me, slip into youI never thought that I was so blind I can finally see the truth It's me for you Tonight, you can't imagine that I'm by your side'Cause it's never gonna be the truth So far for you But can you hear me say Don't throw me away And there's no way out I gotta hold you somehow I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you You wanna touch me too Every day, but all I have is time Our love's the perfect crime I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you You wanna touch me too Every way, and when they set me free Just put your hands on me Take everything that I know you'll break And I give my life away So far for you
