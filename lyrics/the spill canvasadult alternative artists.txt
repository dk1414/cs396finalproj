It starts, with a basic distaste for myself That I can't shake The roots of which Induce a glitch that flips a switch And keeps my Gemini awake It's troubling and twisted Even after all these government cups, that I've pissed in Think by now, I'd have it figured out But still some how I salivate To pull back crimson every day You are a landmark You are my candle in a dark A reason to continue breathing You're the sedative, for the life I live I'd never consider leaving no I'd never consider leaving yeah It's cold, and unfortunate Cause then maybe, they lost their faith in me I thought by now, you would have figured me out But you remained oblivious Let me finally touch you nowI am the virgin dirt Resting by the wasteful race of earth They'll be sorry when I'm gone I'm the air, infected but nobody seems to care Till they're choking on disease You can blame it all On my new generation We just don't have a clue At least that's what the media says So you know So you know So you know that it must be true Oddly enough we destroyed it by watching you Oddly enough we destroyed it by watching you I am the sun Eventually I'll ignite everyone Unless of course they go down first in the flood I am the hope I'm festering in a world that's trying to cope Deep in this, crippling my hopeI know that you want me Haunt me Deep into the tiny, quiet hours of the night Buzzing like a chainsaw Brain thaw Ever wonder why I never put up a fight I woke up on fire Slow-motion dreams of you and everything you do Sing it with the choir I would do anything you told me to I would do anything you told me I would do anything And I don't commonly melt like this When we kiss Under a firestorm rippling through the air I swear, nothing will compare Buzzing like a chainsaw Buzzing like a chainsaw Sweltering release Let mе ignite the way of your bad behavior, may it nеver cease I would do anything you told me to I would do anything you told me, I would do anythingThe odds, were stacked against me My heart held its ground You only fell deeper into something else She became accustom to my Rollercoaster Days Inadvertently me to stay stuck Lost in my bipolar ways Now you speak in secret code And I'm locked outside in the elements Begging for the key I think I'm going to start carving out The memory of your love now So when I give into the underground My soul can be free Please tell me this is imaginary Constant onslaught, nonstop barrage of lies I make my reality You became accustom to my Rollercoaster Days Inadvertently me to stay stuck Lost in my bipolar ways Now you speak in secret code And I'm locked outside in the elements Begging for the key I think I'm going to start carving out The memory of your love now So when I give into the underground My soul can be freeCursed by my imagination Teaming with echoes of situations I do not feel well, pressed beneath this spell Polishing my social skills With one more drink, and two more pills I do not feel good, I thought by now I would But then again...It's like one thousand papercuts Soaked in vinegar Like the battles with yourself That leave you insecure It's all just a numbing charade Until the day you finally wake up And you're not Afraid Bound by my own disposition The endless hunt to find fruition I'm insatiable, even if my cup is full My sore throats are now routine I 'Gotta write those songs, make 'em scream They're insatiable, even if their ears are fullYou're captivating while evading All the questions I have for you like"What exactly makes you tick "When the guilt sets in tell me What are we going to do Your tongue is wet with a top secret passion I hope I am the cause of it I'll navigate this unsturdy vessel Through a soft sea of pillows and blankets And I fight the urge to explore The vastness of your curves I adore You know I, I hate you No, I hate you more You know I, I love you No, I love you more Yes, it's true You've brainwashed me and now I'm more confused I still somehow hope I end up with you Yes, it's true I romanticize every single thing I do Especially when it comes to youFate is an elegant, cold-hearted whore She loves salting my wounds Yes, she enjoys nothing more I bleed confidence from deep within my guts now I'm the king of this pity party With my jewel-encrusted crown I wanna tear apart your room To see if what you say is true Darling, don't you lie, lie to me I wanna break into your heart To see why you want us apart Oh, I'm scared to death to find out what you think of me According to you, we don't click That's a blatant lie and you know it Angel, what are you hiding from me If there is truly another secret lunch-break Working late, lover Then I would die, but at least then I'd be freeI'm racking my brain trying to comprehend How, for some unknown reason Our status will remain as friends I'm destroying my mind trying to understand How, with little to no effort You've got me eating out of the palms of your hands There was not a single spark When my lips landed on yours in the dark But regardless of what happens next You're my beloved, you just don't know it yet Tonight I made a secret oath To keep chasing after you And I am not going to stop Whether you like it or not We're murdering our lives trying to make it work But you and I both know that we are a lost cause And nothing more than specks on this EarthIt's the way that you blush when you're nervous It's your ability to make me earnest I know that you're tired, just let me sing you to sleep It's about how you laugh out of pity,'Cause let's be honest, I'm not really that funny I know that you're shot, just let me sing you to sleep If you need anything, just the say the word I mean anything Rest assured, if you start to doze Then I'll tuck you in and plant my lips where your necklaces close It's those pills that you don't need to take,Medicating perfection, now that's a mistake I know that you're spent, just let me sing you to sleep It's your finger and how I'm wrapped around it It's your grace and how it keeps me grounded I know that you're weak, just let me sing you to sleep If you need anything, just the say the word I mean anything Rest assured, if you start to doze Then I'll tuck you in and plant my lips where your necklaces closeThere's a special place inside my skull Where your D NA it coats my cerebrum in full, oh Stuttering and drooling My shredded throat will try to sing for you What do you say  Would you marry me today The moon will gush all inside out And my nightmares will go away What do you say  Would you devote yourself today Like riding out a sinking ship As it lowers into the bay Please stay The blood collects and flushes out your cheek bones I've got this secret garden, oh and you are the only one who knows I'm stuttering and drooling My shredded throat will try to sing for you, whoah I'm cutting ties with all the jealous zombies I need to feel your warm body on me I need to feel your warm body on me
