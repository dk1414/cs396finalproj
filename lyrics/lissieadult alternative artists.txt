You set the sun, I feel your waves I look at the ocean, so big and brave Am I only a ghost Cause what I fear the most is me I left you on the coast for something only I can see What kind of world will there be When I wake up from this dream I hear you call so far away Just keep me close when I'm afraid And don't you give up on me As I dive into the dark Slip into the endless sea Don't you give up on me Are you swimming in the stars Breathing in eternity Don't you give up on me You are the moon, I feel your weight You tug at the ocean, you help it change And you keep on reminding me of a darkness only I can seeCrush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit Feelin' lit, feelin' light, 2 am summer night I don't care, hands on the wheel, drivin drunk, I'm doin' my thing Rollin the Midwest side and out livin' my life getting' out dreams People told me slow my roll I'm screaming out fuck that I'm gonna do just what I want and there ain't no turnin' back If I fall if I die, know I lived it to the fullest If I fall if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good Tell me what you know about dreamin' dreamin'You don't really know about nothin' nothin'Tell me what you know about them night terrors every night5 am, cold sweats wakin' up to the skies Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams Tell me what you know about night terrors, nothin'You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow You rather lay awake in a bed full of sorrow I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shines ain't always gonna be gold I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be goodI turned my back, you were gone in a flash like you always do You've always gone off somewhere else And when the phone rang and I thought it was you And I sprang like a kid who just got out of school But it's almost always never you, never you I screamed like a child My insides went wild And when I'm alone with you You make me feel and you make me feel When I'm alone with you You are the one, you are the one And when I reach out and I only grab air And it kills me to think that you never did care and it's hopeless You've always run off somewhere else I'm throwing a tantrum Why are you such a phantom It was dark maybe you couldn't see me Braid in her hair, her name is Tiffany I know that girl she lives on my street And she wants you, they all want you The kind of girl's only after one thing You on her arm, to see and be seen To show you chose her over me Like she won you Baby I warned you But they all want you when you're shining Like a bar fly who's always buying The one guy who never says "No"But I'm the one that sees you in the party; people leave you And my heart breaks watching it takin' its toll Up on a stage with your precious guitar Everyone wants to be where you are To bathe in the glorious light of your star They all want to Its cuz they want you Its closing time when your boys show up They got a keg of beer in that pick up truck Egging you on to go out an get drunk You know you want to Baby I warned youAre you out there To take away my fear I haven't lost my hope Even though I am so far from my home I've been living life on the edge Slip and fall if I take one more step There's safety in numbers, I guess But I'm going rogue in the wild, wild west Wild, wild west Wild, wild west Wild, wild From where I stand There's a world where you can All that you lost, you get back And all that you want, you can have I've been living my life on the edge Slip and fall if I take one more step There's safety in numbers, I guess But I'm going rogue in the wild, wild west Wild, wild west Wild, wild west Wild, wildMidnight, knocking on my window Light playing tricks on me Oh, I’m running out of time Wasted so many hours Gave up all of my power and for what It’s like I’ve been out of my mind And I won’t give up I won’t give up I want a love that's made of blood and muscle I want a love that's brave, can take my tears I wanna laugh at the dark like I’m not scared of nothing I wanna love that's made of blood and muscle Blood and muscle, muscle Blood and muscle, muscle Blood and muscle, muscle The crows fly higher and higher Their cries sound like a choir in the sky It’s like they’re taunting meOh oh woah oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh Caught in a bad romance Oh oh woah oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh Caught in a bad romance Ra ra-ah-ah Roma roma-ma Gaga, ooh la la Want your bad romance Ra ra-oh-ra-ra Roma roma-ma Gaga, ooh la la Want your bad romance I want your ugly I want your disease I want your everything As long as it's free I want your love Love, love, love I want your love I want your drama The touch of your hand I want your leather-studded Kiss in the sandAnd I'll fall on my knees Tell me how's the way to be Tell me how's the way to go Tell me all that I should know And I'll fall on my knees Tell me how's the way to go Tell me how's the way to be To evoke some empathy Danger will follow me now Everywhere I go Angels will call on me And take me to my home This tired mind just wants to be led home And I'll fall on my knees Tell me how's the way to go Tell me how's the way to see Show me all that I could be And I'll fall on my knees Tell me how's the way to be Tell me how's the way to go Tell me why I feel so lowI stole your magazine The one with the beauty queen on the front I see her look at me I swear that it is mockingly What the fuck And you decide what I should like But I don’t buy no hype Like in the magazine The one with the beauty queen on the front I wanna run, run far away I gotta get far away from you I gotta keep my identity And focus what I can do, oh!I don’t want to be famous If I got to be shameless If you don’t know what my name is So what, so what I don’ know what this game is Cause I’m not even playing it You don’t know what my name is So what, so what Who knows what you'll find when you look inside Haunted beach, roll the dice The zombies in the corner aren't amused Play the part of the blushing bride Tame the horse and take it for a ride This thread of consolation comes loose I could've been a hero, I could've been a zero Could've been all these things I could've been nothing, I could've been bluffing Could've been all these things And if I am unable, tell him that I'll try But underneath the table I will spin the wheel and hope for gold I've seen the road and I've seen it hide Out of view, cloaked by night I want my forty acres in the sun Bitter winds come in from the north My spirit dims, but I feel the force"No longer in my hands," I say to you I could've been a hero, I could've been a zero Could've been all these things I could've been nothing, I could've had something Could've been all these things And if I am unable, tell him that I'll try But underneath the table I will spin the wheel and hope for gold Oh, and where it stops, nobody knows
