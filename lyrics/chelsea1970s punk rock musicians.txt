This time it don’t feel like you want it all Did I do something wrong to make you go Said I would know when it's all good to fall Now I just need you here to hold me close Cause I don't want another heart to fill the holes That you left under my covers for me to grow cold I don't wanna miss somebody who's not missing me But the city feels so lonely when you leave My room, where I want you Tangled ease in my sheets In your shirt that I got you Half asleep, holding onto me My bed where you left me Tangled up, now it's noon In your shirt that you gave me Half asleep, wishing I still had you Half asleep, wishing I still had you This time you said, you’re playing games again What are we becoming of it now It's fine, I said, if you're the one in my head'Cause I just don't know how to put you outIt's just a cigarette and it cannot be that bad Honey, don't you love me  And you know it makes me sad It's just a cigarette like you always used to do I was different then, I don't need them to be cool It's just a cigarette and it harms your pretty lungs Well, it's only twice a week so there's not much of a chance It's just a cigarette, it'll soon be only ten Honey, can't you trust me  When I want to stop, I can It's just a cigarette and it's just a Marlboro Light Maybe, but is it worth it if we fight It's just a cigarette that I got from Jamie-Lee Oh, she's gonna get a smack, and I'm gonna give you three It's just a cigarette and I only did it once It's only twice a week so there's not much of a chance It's just a cigarette and I'm sorry that I did it Honey, can't you trust me  When I want to stop, I canLyin' isn't better than silence Floatin', but I feel like I'm dyin'Still, no matter where I go At the end of every road You were good to me You were good to me, yeah I know it's easier to run After everything I've done You were good to me You were good to me You were good to me You were good to me Leavin' isn't better than tryin'Growin', but I'm just growin' tired Now I'm worried for my soul And I'm still scared of growin' old You were good to me You were good to me, yeah And I'm so used to lettin' go But I don't wanna be alone You were good to me You were good to me, yeah, ohWe know that this won't last Not like it used to And I'm okay with that But not if I lose you I can feel it in my bones Sinking deeper in the overflow Can you feel it in your soul If I'm honest Maybe we're better off alone Maybe we're better off alone Maybe we're better off Maybe we're better off alone Maybe we're better off I won't turn my back Now that you want to And if there's nothing left Why does it haunt you You're still in the shower Don’t know where you're gonna go I wish I had the power To make this house feel more like home I won't sleep a minute Leave the light on by the bed The bed you should be in, yeah It’s not how it's supposed to end Please don't leave me here I don't know where I started Please don't leave me here I don't know where my heart is I'll see you when I see you It hurts, you'll never know’Cause maybe you’ll come running When you're done being alone I swear I’ll wait forever If it means not letting go I'll put you under pressure Were you scared of getting close Waking up back home in New York City And I know I miss you, and I hope you miss me too, yeah The days away leave me feeling so empty But I can't wait 'til I can take you with me, ooh yeah Say, you're gonna stay with me Don't you let me go, no You're the kinda love for me You already know Come back home late And fall right into your bed Every time I feel it over again You're throwing fuel into my fire Racing, making me bleed Do you still feel it in your chest The way you did at sixteen Didn't know I was alive Until you made my heart beat Thought my youth was going quickly But you give me sixteen I'm tryna find my way through L AX And I'm so lost, don't know what to expect to ya Growing up means growing tired, I guess, yeah But nothing gets me when I'm right here next to you, yeahThis time it don’t feel like you want it all Did I do something wrong to make you go Said I would know when it's all good to fall Now I just need you here to hold me close Cause
