Life's short, don't make a mess of it To the ends of the earth, you'll look for a sense in it No chances, no plans I'll smash the windows of my box, I'll be a madman It's no time to be twenty-one To be anyone Hold back, see what you miss of it Out of the shadows, into the thick of it No maybes, no guessing I'm getting wound up, the plot sickens It's no time to be twenty-one To be anyone Strip down to the bare facts of it Into the cold heart, no hope and all that shit No chances, no plans I think I'll be somebody else or else a madman It's no time to be twenty-one To be anyone No-no-no-no-no-no No-no-no-no-no-noI'm lying in a hospital I'm pinned against the bed A stethoscope upon my heart A hand against my head They're peeling off the bandages I'm wincing in the light The nurse is looking anxious And she's quivering with fright Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes x4 The doctors are avoiding me My vision is confused I listen to my earphones And I catch the evening news A murderer's been killed And he donates his sight to science I'm locked into a private ward I realise that I must be Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes x4 I smash the light in anger Push my bed against the door I close my lids across the eyes And wish to see no more The eye receives the messages And sends them to the brain No guarantee the stimuli Must be perceived the same wayWe're talking into corners finding ways to fill the vacuum And though our mouths are dry we talk in hope to hit on something new Tied to the railway tracks, it's one way to revive but no way to relax We're just bored teenagers Looking for love or should I say emotional rages Bored teenagers Seeing ourselves as strangers We talk about the whys and wherefore, do we really care at all Talk about the frailty of words is rarely meaningful When we're sitting watching the 'planes burn up through the night like meteorites We're just bored teenagers Looking for love or should I say emotional rages Bored teenagers Seeing ourselves as strangers Bored teenagers Bored teenagers, oh yeahI wonder what we'll play for you tonight Something heavy or something light Something to set your soul alight I wonder how we'll answer when you say"We don't like you, go away Come back when you've learned to play"I wonder what we'll do when things go wrong When we're half-way through our favorite song We look up and the audience has gone Will we feel a little bit obscure Think we're not needed here We must be new wave, they'll like us next year We don't give a damn We don't give a damn We don't give a damnThe great British mistake was looking for a way out Was getting complacent, not noticing The pulse was racing The mistake was fighting The change, was staying the same It couldn't adapt so it couldn't survive Something had to give The people take a downhill slide into the gloom Into the darn recesses of their minds I swoop over your city like a bird I climb the high branches and observe Into the mouth, into the soul I cast a shadow that swallows you whole I swoop, I climb, I cling, I suck I swallow you whole String out the drip-feed, they're losing their world They're losing their hard boys and magazine girls Advert illegal, T.V  as outlaw, motive as spell They'll see the books burn  They'll be 451 It's people against things and not against each other Out of the pre-pack, into the fear, into themselves They're the great British mistake The genie's out of the bottle, call in the magician They didn't mean to free him, devil behind them Devil in the mirror, chained to their right hands They're the great British mistake They'll have to come to terms now, they'll take it out somehow They'll blame it all on something The British mistake - when will it be over How can they avoid it What are you gonna do with your new ways What are you gonna do with your new wave Maybe it's that you no longer care You're so great, just gotta stand there Or were you never even bothered anyway About the new wave What about the new wave Did you think it would change things Here we all are in the latest craze Stick with the crowd, hope it's not a passing phase It's the latest thing to be nowhere You can turn into the wallpaper But you know you're always there anyway Without the new wave What about the new wave Did you think it would change things It's just safety in numbers Safety in numbers Safety in numbers Safety inâ€”Who wait in the cafe and magazine Who wait for morning or fag machine Who leave it all unfinalised And undecided...We who wait Who wait in the bus queue and prison cell Who wait for illness to take its toll Who wait for God knows what Sometimes it's not clear to...We who wait I have been dancing in the penny arcade I'll hug the symbols of my apathy And hog the taste of anarchy and animosity It's any means of escape...For those of us who wait Who wait in drinking and lost career Who wait for letter or high summer.4 Who want some kind of clue It's not just two plus two to...We who waitBlank-faced Was this what our elders taught Dim the lights and live like storybook I can't focus for the pinball I'm all shook up and I think I see it all But I know that it ain't that simple I got loose Up on the roof Waiting for you Two-faced Was this what our elders taught We're human too Indulge in small talk I take a walk down the alley Some drunk half-kills me We're fighting on the floor for a ha'penny I got loose Up on the roof Waiting for you Well, I guess I'm waiting for the punchline I'm a refugee with a rare find I've got a place where I can unwindMaybe - maybe a fool for trusting Maybe - maybe a fool for following The god of wisdom, not of love But I'm riding with the new church I'm riding with the new church Relying on the new church And a new word Hang on - if you hang on to faith and meekness Before long, it's power for the strong It's twisted into something evil Something wrong So, I'm riding with the new church I'm riding with the new church Relying on the new church And a new word So long - goodbye to the blind and the weaklings Be strong - I'll do what I want I'll follow my feelings I'll go where they lead me Strength within you, not without you The new church needs youLeapfrog over fences Little time, less senses Here by this railway cutting Life goes quick and it goes without warning That's how life is in my bombsite dwelling But I don't believe you have to be an idiot To get somewhere these days I don't believe you have to sell your soul And do what everybody says Or get carried away Nowadays I fall among the empty shells and pray Give thanks - I'm happy where I am It's just as well Well, I thank God I never closed my eyes Thank God I never compromised Bombsite boy, the bombsite boy Thank God I wasn't mesmerized Bombsite boy, the bombsite boy - the bombsite boy There's a killer in your subway An anarchist on your street There's a breakdown on your T.V You can't find no relief In fact no feelings at all Your war is totally internal At least I'm sure that mine is - on the outside
