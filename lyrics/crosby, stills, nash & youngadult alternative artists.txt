I'll light the fire You place the flowers in the vase That you bought today Staring at the fire For hours and hours while I listen to you Play your love songs all night long For me, only for me Come to me now And rest your head for just five minutes Everything is done Such a cozy room The windows are illuminated by the evening Sunshine through them, fiery gems For you, only for you Our house is a very, very, very fine house With two cats in the yard Life used to be so hard Now everything is easy cause of you And ourTin soldiers and Nixon's comin'We're finally on our own This summer I hear the drummin'Four dead in Ohio Gotta get down to it Soldiers are gunning us down Should have been done long ago What if you knew her and Found her dead on the ground How can you run when you know Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Gotta get down to it Soldiers are gunning us down Should have been done long ago What if you knew her and Found her dead on the ground How can you run when you know You, who are on the road Must have a code that you can live by And so become yourself Because the past is just a good-bye Teach your children well Your father's hell did slowly go by And feed them on your dreams The one they pick's the one you'll know by Don't you ever ask them why If they told you, you would cry So just look at them and sigh And know they love you And you of tender years Can't know the fears That your elders grew by And so please help Them with your youth They seek the truth Before they can die One morning I woke up and I knew You were really gone A new day, a new way And new eyes to see the dawn Go your way, I'll go mine And carry on The sky is clearing and the night Has gone out The sun, he come, the world Is all full of love Rejoice, rejoice, we have no choice But to carry on The fortunes of fables are able To sing the song Now witness the quickness with which We get along To sing the blues you've got to live the dues And carry on Carry on Love is coming Love is coming to us allI will now proceed to entangle the entire area Almost cut my hair It happened just the other day It was gettin' kinda long I could-a said, it was in my way But I didn't and I wonder why I feel like letting my freak flag fly Yes I feel like I owe it to someone Must be because I had the flu for Christmas And I'm not feelin' up to par It increases my paranoia Like lookin' at my mirror and seein' a police car But I'm not givin' in an inch to fear'Cause I promised myself this year I feel like I owe it to someone When I finally get myself together I'm gonna get down in that sunny southern weather And I find a place inside to laugh Separate the wheat from the chaff I feel like I owe it to someoneThere is a town in North Ontario With dream, comfort, memory to spare And in my mind, I still need a place to go All my changes were there Blue, blue windows behind the stars Yellow moon on the rise Big birds flying across the sky Throwing shadows on our eyes Leave us Helpless, helpless, helpless Babe, can you hear me now The chains are locked and tied across my door Babe, sing with me somehow Blue, blue windows behind the stars Yellow moon on the rise Big birds flying across the sky Throwing shadows on our eyes Leave usWell, I came upon a child of God He was walking along the road And I asked him, "tell me, where are you going "This he told me Said, "I'm going down to Yasgur's Farm Gonna join in a rock and roll band Got to get back to the land And set my soul free"We are stardust, we are golden We are billion-year-old carbon And we've got to get ourselves Back to the garden Well, then can I walk beside you I have come to lose the smog And I feel myself a cog In somethin' turning And maybe it's the time of year Yes, and maybe it's the time of man And I don't know who I am But life is for learningFind the cost of freedom Buried in the ground Mother Earth will swallow you Lay your body down Find the cost of freedom Buried in the ground Mother Earth will swallow you Lay your body downFour and twenty years ago I come into this life The son of a woman and a man who lived in strife He was tired of being poor And he wasn't into selling door to door And he worked like the devil to be more A different kind of poverty now upsets me so Night after sleepless night, I walk the floor and I want to know Why am I so alone Where is my woman, can I bring her home Have I driven her away  Is she gone Morning comes the sunrise and I'm driven to my bed I see that it is empty and there's devils in my head I embrace the many colored beast I grow weary of the torment, can there be no peace And I find myself just wishing that my life would simply ceaseWe're gonna do one more song and then we're gonna take a ten minute break and then come back and play electric music and boogie This one is called if you can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with If you're down and confused And you don't remember who you're talkin' to Concentration slips away'Cause your baby is so far away Well there's a rose, in the fisted glove And the eagle flies with the dove And if you can't be with the one you love, honey Love the one you're with Love the one you're with Love the one you're with Love the one you're with Don't be angry, don't be sad Don't sit cryin' over good times you had There's a girl, right next to you And she's just waiting for something to do
