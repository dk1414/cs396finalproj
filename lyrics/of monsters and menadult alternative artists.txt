Hey!Hey!Hey!I don't like walking around this old and empty house So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear The stairs creak as you sleep; it's keeping me awake It's the house telling you to close your eyes And some days I can't even dress myself It's killing me to see you this way'Cause though the truth may vary, this Ship will carry our Bodies safe to shore Hey!Hey!Hey!There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back Well, tell her that I miss our little talks Soon it will be over and buried with our past We used to play outside when we were young, and full of life and full of love Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear'Cause though the truth may vary, this Ship will carry our Bodies safe to shoreJumping up and down the floor My head, is an animal And once there was an animal It had a son that mowed the lawn The son was an okay guy They had a pet dragonfly The dragonfly, it ran away But it came back with a story to say Her dirty paws and furry coat She ran down the forest slopes The forest of talking trees They used to sing about the birds and the bees The bees had declared a war The sky wasn't big enough for them all The birds, they got help from below From dirty paws and the creatures of snow La-la-la La-la-la-la La-la-la La-la-la-laWell, maybe I'm a crook for stealing your heart away Yeah, maybe I'm a crook for not caring for it Yeah, maybe I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad person Well, baby, I know And these fingertips will never run through your skin And those bright blue eyes can only meet mine across a room Filled with people that are less important than you All 'cause you love, love, love when you know I can't love You love, love, love when you know I can't love You love, love, love when you know I can't love you So I think it's best, we both forget before we dwell on it The way you held me so tight All through the night, till it was near morning'Cause you love, love, love when you know I can't love You love, love, love when you know I can't love You love, love, love when you know I can't love you All 'cause you love, love, love when you know I can't love You love, love, love when you know I can't love You love, love, love when you know I can't love youTaking over this town, they should worry But these problems aside, I think I taught you well That we won't run, and we won't run, and we won't run And in the winter night sky, ships are sailing Looking down on these bright blue city lights And they won't wait, and they won't wait, and they won't wait We're here to stay, we're here to stay, we're here to stay Howling ghosts, they reappear In mountains that are stacked with fear But you're a king and I'm a lionheart A lionheart His crown lit up the way as we moved slowly Past the wondering eyes of the ones that were left behind Though far away, though far away, though far away We're still the same, we're still the same, we're still the same Howling ghosts, they reappear In mountains that are stacked with fear But you're a king and I'm a lionheartLost in skies of powdered gold Caught in clouds of silver ropes Showered by the empty hopes As I tumble down, falling fast to the ground I know I'll wither so peel away the bark'Cause nothing grows when it is dark In spite of all my fears, I can see it all so clear I see it all so clear Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes And feel the tones that tremble down your spine Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes And let your colours bleed and blend with mine Making waves in pitch black sand Feel the salt dance on my hands Raw and charcoal coloured thighs Feel so cold and my skin feels so paper-thin I know I'll wither so peel away the bark'Cause nothing grows when it is dark In spite of all my fears, I can see it all so clear I see it all so clearI heard them calling in the distance So I packed my things and ran Far away from all the trouble I have caused with my two hands Alone we traveled armed with nothing but a shadow We fled far away Hold your horses now Through the woods, we ran Hold your horses now Through the woods, we ran Some had scars and some had scratches It made me wonder about their past And as I looked around, I began to notice That we were nothing like the rest Hold your horses now Through the woods, we ran Hold your horses now Through the woods, we ranOpen my chest and colour my spine I'm giving you all, I'm giving you all Swallow my breath and take what is mine I'm giving you all, I'm giving you all I'll be the blood if you'll be the bones I'm giving you all, I'm giving you all So lift up my body and lose all control I'm giving you all, I'm giving you all You hover like a hummingbird, haunt me in my sleep You're sailing from another world, sinking in my sea Oh, you're feeding on my energy, letting go of it She wants it And I run from wolves, ooh Breathing heavily at my feet And I run from wolves, ooh Tearing into me without teeth I can see through you; we are the same It's perfectly strange; you run in my veins How can I keep you inside my lungs I breathe what is yours; you breathe what is mineIf I could face them If I could make amends With all my shadows I'd bow my head and welcome them But I feel it burning Like when the winter wind stops my breathing Are you really gonna love me when I'm gone I fear you won't I fear you don't And it echoes when I breathe Until all you see is my ghost Empty vessel, crooked teeth Wish you could see And they call me under And I'm shaking like a leaf And they call me under And I wither underneath In this stormHey  Hey!I see colour raining down Feral feeling, swaying sound But I don’t know what you want I am open and I am restless Let me feel it out, let it all come out Wake me up I’m fever dreaming And now I lose control I'm fever dreaming Shake it out It's just what I'm feeling And now I take control I'm fever dreaming Oh so quiet when they laid me in the stream And the starlit sky grew before my eyes Twenty-two women stood by the banks and cried Oh, II'm looking for a place to start And everything feels so different now Just grab a hold of my hand I will lead you through this wonderland Water up to my knees But sharks are swimming in the sea Just follow my yellow light And ignore all those big warning signs Somewhere deep in the dark A howling beast hears us talk I dare you to close your eyes And see all the colors in disguise Running into the night The earth is shaking and I see a light The light is blinding my eyes As the soft walls eat us alive
