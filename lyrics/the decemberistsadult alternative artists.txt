We are two mariners, our ships' sole survivors In this belly of a whale Its ribs our ceiling beams, its guts our carpeting I guess we have some time to kill You may not remember me, I was a child of three And you, a lad of eighteen But I remember you, and I will relate to you How our histories interweave At the time you were a rake and a roustabout Spending all your money on the whores and hounds Oh-ohhhhh You had a charming air, all cheap and debonair My widowed mother found so sweet And so she took you in, her sheets still warm with him Now filled with filth and foul disease As time wore on, you proved a debt-ridden drunken mess Leaving my mother a poor consumptive wretch Oh-ohhhhh And then you disappeared, your gambling arrears The only thing you left behind And then the magistrate reclaimed our small estate And my poor mother lost her mind Then, one day in Spring, my dear sweet mother died But before she did, I took her hand as she, dying, cried:Oh-ohhhhhWhen we arrive Sons & daughters We'll make our homes on the water We'll build our walls aluminum We'll fill our mouths with cinnamon now These currents pull us 'cross the border Steady your boats Arms to shoulder'Til tides all pull Our hull aground Making this cold harbour now home Take up your arms Sons and daughters We will arise from the bunkers By land, by sea, by dirigible We'll leave our tracks untraceable now When we arrive Sons and daughters We'll make our homes on the water We'll build our walls aluminum We'll fill our mouths with cinnamon We'll make our homes on the waterElectricity  Yeah, you can all thank me Took some lightning, a kite, and a fat brass key And they're putting up streetlights in Gay Paris You’re welcome from our young nation I’m the only American the French wanna see They call me a genius, I can’t disagree They have guns, they have funds They can set us free, invest in my reputation And do you know who the fuck I am Yeah, do you know who the fuck I am Do you know who the fuck I am I am Poor-Richard’s-Almanack-writing Benjamin Fuckin’ Franklin I said, early to bed, bitches, early to rise They make a man healthy, wealthy, and wise Soldiers are fighting for freedom, they have no supplies So diplomacy happens at night John Adams debates at the gates of Versailles He whines and berates and awaits a reply As I stay up late with a succulent breast or a thigh Alright, diplomacy happens at nightI alight like a whisper I alight with the lights out And it won't take me long just to find you And it won't take me long just to find you I'm allied to the winter But don't you get clever Don't you get clever I'm allied to the landslide Gonna leave you all severed Gonna leave you all severed I alone am the answer I alone will make wrongs right But in order to root out the cancer It's got to be kept from the sunlight I'm allied to the winter But don't you get clever Don't you get clever I'm allied to the landslide Gonna leave you all severed Gonna leave you all severedAnd here I dreamt I was a soldier And I marched the streets of Birkenau And I recall in spring The perfume that the air would bring To the indolent town Where the barkers call the moon down The carnival was ringing loudly now And just to lay with you There's nothing that I wouldn't do Save lay my rifle down And try one, and try two Guess it always comes down to Alright, it's okay Guess it's better to turn this way Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey-y, hey And I am nothing of a builder But here I dreamt I was an architect And I built this balustrade To keep you home, to keep you safe From the outside world But the angles and the corners Even though my work is unparalleled They never seemed to meet This structure fell about our feet And we were free to goI want you, thin fingers I wanted you, thin fingernails And when you bend backwards I wanted you, I needed you Oh-oh, to make me better I'll love you in springtime I lost you when summer came And when you pulled backwards I wanted to, I needed to Oh-oh, to make me better Oh-oh, to make me better But we're not so starry-eyed anymore Like the perfect paramour you were in your letters And won't it all just come around to make you Let it all unbreak you to the day you met her But it'd make you better It'd make you better I sung you your twinges I suffered you your tattletales And when you broke sideways I wanted you, I needed you Oh-oh, to make me better Oh-oh, to make me betterIt was a cold night And the snow lay round I pulled my coat tight Against the falling down And the sun was all And the sun was all down And the sun was all And the sun was all down I am a poor man I haven't wealth nor fame I have my two hands And a house to my name And the winter's so And the winter's so long And the winter's so And the winter's so long And all the stars were crashing 'round As I laid eyes on what I'd found It was a white crane It was a helpless thing Upon a red stain With an arrow in its wing And it called and cried And it called and cried so And it called and cried And it called and cried soSee this ancient riverbed See where all the follies led Down by the water and Down by the old main drag I was just some tow-head teen Feeling round for fingers to get in between Down by the water and Down by the old main drag The season rubs me wrong The summer swells anon So knock me down, tear me up But I would bear it all broken just to fill my cup Down by the water and Down by the old main drag Sweet descend this rabble round The pretty little patter of a seaport town Rolling in the water and Rolling down the old main drag All dolled up in gabardine The lash-flashing Leda Of Pier Nineteen Queen of the water and Queen of the old main dragI had entered into a marriage In the summer of my twenty-first year And the bells rang for our wedding Only now do I remember it clear Alright, alright, alright No more a rake and no more a bachelor I was wedded and it whetted my thirst Until her womb start spilling out babies Only then did I reckon my curse Alright, alright, alright Alright, alright, alright First came Isaiah with his crinkled little fingers Then came Charlotte and that wretched girl Dawn Ugly Myfanwy died on delivery Mercifully taking her mother along Alright, alright, alrightMy true love went riding out in white and green and gray Past the pale of Offa's wall where she was won't to stray And there she came upon a white and wounded fawn Singing, "Oh, the hazards of love"She, being full of charity, a credit to her sex Sought to right the fawn's hind legs when here her plans were vexed The taiga shifted strange, the beast began to change Singing, "Oh, the hazards of love"Singing, "Oh, the hazards of love"You'll learn soon enough The prettiest whistles won't wrestle the thistles undone, undone Fifteen lithesome maidens lay alone in their bower Fourteen occupations paid to pass the idle hour But Margaret heaves a sigh, her hands clasped to her thigh Singing, "Oh, the hazards of love"Singing, "Oh, the hazards of love."You'll learn soon enough The prettiest whistles won't wrestle the thistles undone, undone Undone, undone, undone
