Hearts aren't really our guides We are truly alone'Cause God ain't up in the sky Holding together our bones Remember we used to speak Now I'm starting to think That your voice was really my own Bouncing off the ceiling back to me God, this can't be God, this can't be God, could it be that all we see is it Is this it Is this it Won't you come down, heaven Won't you come down Won't you cut through the clouds Won't you come down Oh, my heaven, why do you have doors to close Do you have clouds to stop his voice Oh, my heaven, why do you have doors to close Do you have clouds to stop his voice  Is your love really love Is my love really love I think our love isn't love Unless it's love to the end Is your god really god Is my god really god I think our god isn't god If it fits inside our head Is your love really love Is my love really love I think our love isn't love Unless it's love to the end Is your god really god Is my god really god I think our god isn't god If it fits inside our headAnd it's all right, it's all right And it's all right, it's all right Everybody is a failure in this light And it's okay, it's okay And it's okay, it's okay Underneath it nobody's back is straight I tried to stop it when I saw your posture start to bend But honey it was not mine to lift Go throw yourself into the sea And it's all right, it's all right And it's all right, I can't make it right Somebody put a bad lens in your eye You try to shed your skin when you saw yourself in it so thin But you only shed your blood When you climb out you can't climb back in Go throw yourself into the sea Though we don't need a mountain moved We just want to move ourselves Take us somewhere, take us somewhere, anywhere else Go throw yourself into the sea It's all right, it's all right Though we don't ever see you move Slowly the wind turns you to sand In the hands of children on the shoreI was a middle son Between two wayward ones I was more deserving of my parent's love I had an angel's smile Hiding a vulture's bite I had no use for your redeeming blood Aren't I glory, glorious Glory, glorious Aren't we glory, glorious Aren't we worthy, worthy of hearts at our feet'Cause I was a pharisee I never saw my need for grace Then your love, it came to me Stood next to mine and I saw that I was poor Show me I was poor Show us we are Show us we are Glory, glorious We are glory, glorious Not from what good we have done But from being the least Glory, glorious We are glory, glorious Not from what good we have done But from being the leastDead man, were you ever alive or was I just a seed Buried deep inside some woman you wed Right before you crawled out of her bed and crept down the hall Did you think of me Did you even for a second hesitate, in the doorway It's just something I'd like to know Though I'd still love you if you told me That you just walked away My God, what a world you love!Men bury their sons, and without thought, they just walk away And my mother's heart breaks like the water inside of her And my mother's heart breaks like the water inside of her Dead man, is it being high that makes you alive It makes you leave behind three boys and a wife, in '89 And as the track marks inch their way up your arm My mother taught my brothers and I not to call you "Daddy,"But to call you "Father"But I believe there is something here to be learned of Grace Cause I can't help but love you No, I can't help but love you Even with a heart that breaks, like the promises that you made Like the promises that you made The promises that you made Cause I can't help but love you My God, what a world you love…Has it gotten, gotten out of hand yet Has it gotten, gotten out of hand yet Has it gotten, gotten out of hand yet Has it gotten out of hand Catch my eye Catch my eye Catch my eye I am the only thing on my mind It's so easy to keep you distracted Not long you’ll be fully destructed I don't even need to move a muscle'Cause you wrestle with you alone Has it gotten out of hand yet Has it gotten out of hand yet Has it gotten out of hand yet Has it gotten out of hand It's not the cold making my legs shake It's Timmy's ghost taking his place in our hearts forever'Cause it's not the sound keeping me from sleep It's what Jesus said, said about hell underneath I think I'd rather believe in some imaginary place Made up to make children behave So our souls are safe to wander off Wherever they might please Your soul is safe wherever you might be Come now, sleep Come, now sleep Tell me I'm only dreaming Tell me he's just sleeping And when morning comes We'll both wake up to see the sun And love that's enough to keep our friends alive Phone call I pull my car to the side of the road No, it's not the cold making my legs shake It's someone I love being taken away A ghost taking his place in our heartsWell, I've got a will but I want yours I've got a growing heap of crosses and burdens I've simply lost heart to shoulder Simply no strength to lift I've always been a man in need'Cause I keep stepping in and out of the shadow Stepping in and out of the shadow Caught by the drift and pitch of whatever it is That keeps me coming back I want out'Cause I'm getting sick Sick from all this swerving Driver, sick from turning on you Someone show me a hole in this cycle Show me the way away and I'm coming back the way I came No, I've seen this place before Surely this is no place for the light of this world And oh how sweet the sound I know it saved but is it changing a wretch like me And oh my God how sweet is the sound I once was blind but now I just look away Stepping in and out of the shadow Stepping in and out I just look away Stepping in and out of the shadow I just look away Stepping in and outThey fixed your brain when you were young They fixed your brain when you were young They fixed your brain, they fixed it...before you knew the difference And if the good Lord's good sheep do their jobs You would never see they were wolves underneath But good Lord, have you ever seen so many teeth marks That's right, those containers of light come with a kiss But they got quite a bite They fixed your brain when you were young They fixed your brain when you were young Fixed your brain, they fixed it Before you knew the difference They fixed your brain, they fixed it Before you knew the difference Come on!We got our sidewalks We got all of our safely lit streets We got all of our light tested beliefs But when I find love so bright in the alleyway They throw her overboard, I watch her get lost in the wakeWe can always expect to lose radio, radio contact Radio transmission every time that I let our fair moon Lay her body between us I need her now that you're breaking up Soon she'll become my new sun Soon she'll become She's stealing her light from the old one Fast receiving but slow responding To your signals reading, "Son, come home"But I still believe it My God, I still need it But I'm just tired of walking upright When I don't mean right I just want to look right We can always expect to lose radio, radio contact Radio transmission Soon she'll become my new sun Soon she'll become dim reflected love To light my way After I trade loving you for loving to obey
