Rain, rain on my face Hasn't stopped raining for days My world is a flood Slowly I become one with the mud But if I can't swim after forty days And my mind is crushed by the crashing waves Lift me up so high that I cannot fall Lift me oh oh When I'm falling I'm weak and I'm dying I need you to hold me And keep me from drowning again Downpour on my soul Splashing in the ocean, I'm losing control Dark sky all around Can't feel my feet touching the ground But if I can't swim after forty days And my mind is crushed by the crashing waves Lift me up so high that I cannot fall Lift me oh ohI am the only one to blame for this Somehow it all ends up the same Soaring on the wings of selfish pride I flew too high And like Icarus I collide With a world I try so hard to leave behind To rid myself of all but love To give and die To turn away and not become Another nail to pierce the skin Of One who loves More deeply than the oceans More abundant than the tear Of a world embracing every heartache Can I be the one to sacrifice Or grip the spear and watch the blood And water flow Take my world apart I am on my knees Take my world apart Broken on my kneesIn open fields of wild flowers She breathes the air and flies away She thanks her Jesus for the daises and the roses In no simple language Someday she'll understand the meaning of it all He's more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens As close as a heartbeat or a song on her lips Someday she'll trust Him and learn how to see Him Someday He'll call her and she will come running And fall in His arms and the tears will fall down and she'll pray I want to fall in love with You I want to fall in love with You I want to fall in love with You I want to fall in love with You Sitting silent wearing Sunday best The sermon echoes through the walls A great salvation through it calls to the people Who stare into nowhere, and can't feel the chains on their souls He's more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens As close a heartbeat or a song on our lips Someday we'll trust Him and learn how to see Him Someday He'll call us and we will come running And fall in His arms and the tears will fall down and we'll prayI'll fly away, O glory I'll fly away When I die, Hallelujah bye and bye I'll fly away Some bright morning, when this life is o'er I'll fly away To a land on God's celestial shore I'll fly away When the shadows of this life have grown I'll fly away Like a bird from these prison walls I'll fly, I'll fly away And I'll fly away, O glory I'll fly away When I die, Hallelujah bye and bye I'll fly away O, how glad and happy when we meet I'll fly away No more cold iron shackles on my feet I'll fly awayWe are one in the Spirit, we are one in the Lord We are one in the Spirit, we are one in the

who opened up to heavenYeah Arms nailed down, are you telling me something Eyes turned out, are you looking for someone This is the one thing The one thing that I know Blood-stained brow, are you dying for nothing Flesh and blood, is it so elemental And this is the one thing The one thing that I know This is the one thing The one thing that I know Blood-stained brow, He wasn't broken for nothing Arms nailed down, He didn't die for nothing This is the one thing The one thing that I know This is the one thing The one thing that I know This is the one thing The one thing that I know This is the one thing The one thing that I knowDon't try to reach me, I'm already dead The pain when it grips me, for things that I've done Well, I try to make you proud But for crying out loud Just give me a chance to hide away Exhaustion takes over, will this someday be over Fearful tears are running down The pain you've laid, don't speak a sound Don't take my heart away from me And they think I fell down again Daddy, don't you love me Then why do you hit me And Momma don't you love me Then why do you hurt me Well, I try to make you proud But for crying out loud Just give me a chance to hide away Exhaustion takes over, will this someday be over Fearful tears are running down The pain you've laid, don't speak a sound Don't take my heart away from me And they think I fell down againWe wandered off like children, in the woods We let the searchers come and never find us We tried to make a life among the trees While your dreams collected planes and cars and cities You slipped away from me while I was sleeping To climb the tallest oak and see the lights Your dissatisfaction gave you questions Do you remember what the city sounded like Do you remember what the city sounded like So, stay up with me don't fall asleep We only have this moment once in our lives The next time we'll meet under city lights But we're here tonight so, lets make it all it was meant to be So, I held you but the cold was from inside I knew I couldn't keep you if I tried But I watched as the distance spread as the shadows grew And the longings came like wolves to devour you So, stay up with me don't fall asleep'Cause we only have this moment once in our lives The next time we'll meet under city lights So, lets make it all it was meant to beOn Jordan's stormy banks I stand And cast a wishful eye To Canaan's fair and happy land Where my possessions lie All o'er those wide extended plains Shines one eternal day There God, the Son forever reigns And scatters night away I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promised Land I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promised Land No chilling wind nor poisonous breath Can reach that healthful shore Where sickness, sorrow, pain, and death Are felt and feared no more I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promised Land I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promised Land
