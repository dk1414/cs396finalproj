Yeah I can see it coming on the horizon Sky turning black, it's raining down Can't move my feet, cannot be shaken Not moving, I'm standing strong I'm standing so firm I can't be moved I'm standing so firm I can't be moved I will stand I will stand When everything falls away I will fight this war forever Or until I die I will stand I will stand When everyone falls away I will fight this war forever Or until I dieExchanging beauty For the ashes Given my heart to Nothing real Exchanging beauty For the ashes Given my heart to Nothing real I've given my heart away To so many things So many times I've failed Help me stop This endless Cycle Remind me Of how it Can be Take me back I surrender all Without you My heart is brokenI've walked with the kings and I've marched to the pounding drums Then you came You asked me to change but like a fool I refused And walked away Oh, oh It's not like you would know, would you You were white as snow But still you plead, still you plead guilty They took my crown as I hung my head and tied the noose Around my neck They tied me up and left me for dead Please cut, cut me loose It's not like you would know, would you You were white as snow But still you plead, still you plead guilty It's not like you would know, would you You were white as snow Still you plead, still you plead guilty It's not like you would know, would you You were white as snow You were white as snow You were white as snowFive words, five words is all it would take Five words to change your heart and mind In the heat of the sun I know you're the only one You still can't hold yourself together Alone..  Alone...You have this conversation to satisfy your most intimate inner thoughts Then you bite your lip when it matters most A shade of red in sight Can you taste the blood Taste it on your lips Rip the seam then I'll show you How the strings become the stitches in your mouth In your silence we are louder When the strings become the stitches in your mouth Your growing imagination preparing you for what your heart requires to say Then you bite your lip when it matters most A shade of red in sight Can you taste the blood Taste it on your lips Rip the seam then I'll show you How the strings become the stitches in your mouth In your silence we are louder When the strings become the stitches in your mouthRed leaves blow in the wind Leaving home and everything it's known behind Barren branches wave goodbye As the red leaves slowly die Every flower stares and watches As the wind takes me away Before the sun shone upon me Now the wind takes me away Red leaves falling Through the branches Making their way to the ground Blowing by the flowers sleeping No one knows the leaves are leavingWho will protect you from these dog like vultures And I know they're small their teeth are sharp We've been sent with eyes to see them And ears to hear their steps Our hearts are softer than the sheep We've been known to calm the storm and silence the ocean With strength to spare you from their teeth Our eyes are upon you And we will protect you Be assured No fang will breech Your fleece Cause we are called to lead and sent to gather So, bare your teeth And sharpen your claws We've been sent with eyes to see them And ears to hear their steps Our hearts are softer than the sheep We've been known to calm the storm And silence the ocean With strength to spare you from their teethYou cover me!I am spent and with death You paid my ransom For the witness of Your word To bring them in, the jackal's sin Oh, the eyes of death are upon me And the watchman takes his toll If the river will run dry it will never take us home With idle minds, we grew unconscious as the hunter stalks his prey His eyes, his eyes are locked on me You cover the darkest part of me With a look that's sure to set the captives free Oh, make way for I am not the Redeemer Nor do the mountains fall in my name But with slightest cry, my hunter You will fail to reach your prey Still with idle minds unconscious As the hunter stalks his prey His eyes, his eyes are locked on me You cover the darkest part of me With a look that's sure to set the captives free With love that the blindest eyes will see You cover the darkest part of meChorus of angels, destroy my silence That haunts me, it claims me While darkness walks beside me Chorus of angels, destroy my silence That haunts me, it claims me While darkness walks beside me I saw the angels sing along to wake up the beautiful sleeping world Their voices will rise to test the strength of man Wake up the beautiful sleeping world Wake up now Wake up now We will see the fire The skies will open up The clouds will burn red And our sins will forget us And time will not shake us Our hearts are made of gold These walls won't overtake us These walls won't overtake us I saw the angels sing along to wake up the beautiful sleeping world Their voices will rise to test the strength of man Wake up the beautiful sleeping worldHave you seen the sun Have you seen the sun, or has the darkness dragged you further from your door Take each other's hands, look into the clouds Such a beautiful song we sing Finally finding our own way back home Such a beautiful song we sing Oh no, this is no time for excuses We've singled you out and the leaders keep running away The sound of trumpets will carry you home The sound of trumpets will resound and we all sing Take each other's hands, look into the clouds Such a beautiful song we sing Finally finding our own way back home Such a beautiful song we sing Re-break the bone to assure the healing So that we might know you again Re-break the bone, re-break the bone, re-break the bone Sound the alarm like a vulture on the nation with silver Oh no, have we sealed our own destruction Walking away from the only thing that matters Re-break the bone, re-break the bone, re-break the bone to asure the healing Re-break the bone, know you againThey came with different names Bore the mark of the old They came with different names Bore the mark of the old We've tried to run but it's no use And all this time we've reached the point of desperation In these iron walls we hide But we leave the gates wide open FO R N OW We are here and we are one And hearts are empty FO R N OW For the waking of the sun Is not that easy FO R N OW We are here and we are one I will never be the same And I'll burn with a heart of fire It's never going to be the same When I see their faces They came with different names And bore the mark of the old And from their lips came the same strain That's waking up, that's waking up the sun
