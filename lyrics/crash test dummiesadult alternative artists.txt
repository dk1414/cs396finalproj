Once there was this kid who Got into an accident and couldn't come to school But when he finally came back His hair had turned from black into bright white He said that it was from when The cars had smashed so hard Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm Once there was this girl who Wouldn't go and change with the girls in the change room But when they finally made her They saw birthmarks all over her body She couldn't quite explain it They'd always just been there Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmmTarzan wasn't a ladies' man He'd just come along and scoop 'em up under his arm like that Quick as a cat in the jungle But Clark Kent, now there was a real gent He would not be caught sittin' around in no junglescape Dumb as an ape, doing nothin'Superman never made any money For saving the world from Solomon Grundy And sometimes, I despair the world will never see another man like him Hey Bob, Supe' had a straight job Even though he could have smashed through any bank in the United States Well, he had the strength, but he would not Folks said his family were all dead The planet crumbled, but Superman, he forced himself to carry on Forget Krypton and keep going Superman never made any money For saving the world from Solomon Grundy And sometimes, I despair the world will never see another man like himWhat is it that makes me just a little bit queasy There's a breeze that makes my breathing not so easy I've had my lungs checked out with X-rays I've smelled the hospital hallways Someday I'll have a disappearing hairline Someday I'll wear pyjamas in the daytime Times when the day is like a play by Sartre When it seems a book burning's in perfect order I gave the doctor my description I tried to stick to my prescriptions Someday I'll have a disappearing hairline Someday I'll wear pyjamas in the daytime Oh-oh-oh-oh, afternoons will be measured out Measured out, measured with Coffee spoons and T.S  Eliot Maybe if I could do a play-by-playback I could change the test results that I will get back I've watched the summer evening pass by I've heard the rattle in my bronchiâ€”Someday I'll have a disappearing hairline Someday I'll wear pyjamas in the daytimeWhen I'm sampling from your bosom Sometimes I suffer from distractions like Why does God cause things like tornadoes And train wrecks When I'm swimming in When I'm swimming in your ocean Floating aloft on creams And scented lotions, well I can get pretty side-tracked I hope you'll understand When I kneel before your bounty Sometimes I wonder if there could be really UF Os that come from other planets When I'm swimming in When I'm swimming in your ocean Floating aloft on creams And scented lotions, well I can get pretty side-tracked I hope you'll understandAfter seven days He was quite tired so God said:"Let there be a day Just for picnics, with wine and bread"He gathered up some people he had made Created blankets and laid back in the shade The people sipped their wine And what with God there, they asked him questions Like: "do you have to eat Or get your hair cut in heaven And if your eye got poked out in this life Would it be waiting up in heaven with your wife "God shuffled his feet and glanced around at them;The people cleared their throats and stared right back at him So he said: "Once there was a boy Who woke up with blue hair To him it was a joy Until he ran out into the warm air He thought of how his friends would come to see And would they laugh, or had he got some strange disease How does a duck know what direction south is And how to tell his wife from all the other ducks You can cut a chicken's head off And it will keep on runnin' and twitchin'When everything seems planned out When everything seems nicely planned out Well the human race come and smack your face How come all my body parts so nicely fit together All my organs doing their jobs, no help from me, no!A person pulls a spider's leg out To watch it keep on movin' and twitchin'When everything seems planned out When everything seems nicely planned out Well the human race come and smack your faceWhen you go on camping trips You're stuck right out in nature Forage in the forest like a primate Using sharpened tools instead of hotplates Your thumb and forefinger Supposed to show you're not a wild beast You can hear the noises at night time They don't have to keep a certain bed time See in the shapes of my body Leftover parts from the apes and monkeys Sometimes when I lie awake I hear the rainfall on my tent fly I think of all the insects that are sleeping And wonder if the animals are dreaming In the days of the caveman And mammoths..  and glaciers Bugs and trees were your food then No pyjamas or doctorsRunning into you like this without warning is like Catching a sniff of tequila in the morning But I'll try, try to keep my food down It's quite an after-taste that you've left now that You're not around You can just pretend we're not in the same room Well, alright, I'll just mosey to the bathroom You flew by like a summer vacation And you left me with T V-movies and a messy kitchen I think I'll disappear now, slip out sideways Just for awhile, but until then I'll stay in, sleep late, excuse me I'll buy a fast car, I'll drive it fast from here There's a beach I haven't seen since last year It's far, but I like night drives:It just makes it nicer when I do arrive I think I'll disappear now, slip out sideways Just for awhile, but until then I'll stay in, sleep late, excuse meI'm still young, but I know my days are numbered1234567 and so on But a time will come when these numbers have all ended And all I've ever seen will be forgotten Won't you come To my funeral when my days are done Life's not long And so I hope when I am finally dead and gone That you'll gather round when I am lowered into the ground When my coffin is sealed and I'm safely 6 feet under Perhaps my friends will see fit then to judge me Oh when they pause to consider all my blunders I hope they won't be too quick to begrudge me Won't you come To my funeral when my days are done Life's not long And so I hope when I am finally dead and gone That you'll gather round when I am lowered into the ground If I should die before I wake up I pray that the Lord my soul will take but My body, my body - that's your jobWho put the doggy in the dog house Who put your granny in the granny house Verse 1:Who put the bed in the mad house Who put that junkie in the junk house Chorus:Keep your eye on things while i'm gone...Keep a lid on things Don't you try everything while i'm gone...Keep a lid on things Verse 2:Who put the fun in the fun house Who put your dad in the Half House Who put the boys in the club house Who put the cat in the cat house
