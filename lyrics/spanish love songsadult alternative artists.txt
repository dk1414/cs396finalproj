On any given day, I'm a six of ten Bed to desk to bar, eyes on the floor Still apologizing for the way I've been Each breath more full of shit than the one before Yeah, I know the negative consumes me Guess I'm alright Let the guilt pass right through me While my friends are taking dives Off of cliffs, and I just worry About the songs I'll never write It don't matter, they don't wanna hear me on the other side So let me ruin my guts tonight Just let me ruin my guts tonight On any given day, it hurts to stand up straight Erasin' the same message from my phone Reachin' out to friends who probably think that I am dead I should wanna go home, but I won't These past four months, I've been so angry I'm not alright Could you please come look right through me And try to give a reason why I don't know you or why you care But the Devil's loose inside And I'm so sick of sayin' sorry when I cryWell, we're gonna waste the days getting outpriced of our apartments Hopin' we don't go homeless, we sure as shit ain't moving home Watching television, we're stealing from our parents So many opinions on how we live But there's no option for even how to get out of bed But my bleak mind says it's cheaper just to die The prick inside my head's laid off and darin' me to try And my bleak mind says, "This is all you got"Hoping all this time, but all you'll find is It gets harder, doesn't it It gets harder, doesn't it Won't see the doctor 'til I'm down on my knees And blacking out in strip malls to avoid Taking care of what's in front of me, so I'll live my life off points from credit card financing You'll stay stuck losing your jobs Let's watch these options pile up or let's ask for help But my bleak mind says it's cheaper just to die The prick inside my head's laid off and darin' me to try And my bleak mind says, "This is all you got"Hoping all this time, but all you'll find is It gets harder, doesn't it It gets harder, doesn't it It gets harder, doesn't it It gets harder, doesn't it Broken nose, another textured ceiling I know where I am, I'll pretend like I'm lost Sometimes I wanna vanish completely And call in sick from life I woke up and didn't feel better Don't know why I act surprised At least each year is getting shorter And the ocean's on the rise'Cause I'm terrified there's no more waiting I'm running out of what comes next Runnin' through jobs I'm gonna hate Living paycheck to paycheck Like my parents, and their parents And their parents before them I should be happy I have no personal effects But I've got my encore I'm back livin' on their floor But I feel like burnin' down my life again I watch the fire spread over my skin Until I'm nothin' left but skeleton I saw a sign in Hanover That said, "The future is in motion"But the motion has me sick It's okay, I'm sick of standing I'm still paying off a good idea From when I was twenty-three A life spent living off loans When I still don't know What I love, I'm over-leveraged My credit's gone weak The city turned off the power You know, it's dark most of the week But if I burned this place down We'd have some heat At least I'm seein' things more positively Because I swear to God, I'm an optimistWhen you saw your dad shoot up for the first time It must've came as quite a shock You sat numb in your room for hours Ignoring the afternoon's drop-offs You picture him, arms outstretched in a song After Sunday school let out He'd drive the family home and you'd Talk about Jesus But fifteen years can change a man Alone in this wilderness Say "keep your head up" if you're not okay But "not okay" is what's expected They claim you're a hero if you can make it off the couch You know the truth in what they say The world's gonna kick you either way But now you're stuck in this routine Just tryin' to make something on your own Your older brother fled the country The cops are comin' 'round your home But Kaylee has a baby on the way They're not gonna leave her a single mother The dope was legal, but they roughed you up for sellin' on the sideStarin' like a stranger from the dirt field Across from my, my childhood home Notice how out of place I look there It's a place I can't afford When my family lost it back in '08 We swore it was just a setback And all we needed was to graduate Keep ignorin' facts Don't you know you were born to die poor, man Don't you know that you're gonna do yourself in And you'll always wake up tired Because there's nowhere we go from here Stuck workin' at that third job, driving Well-meaning moms to protests for minimum wage Still depressed, still living for the weekend Still terrified to die at your age No cancer, no crash, it better all go as planned Or one day soon, you're not gonna get by You know damn well there ain't a promised land The cost of living means the cost to stay aliveThe pain is back in my chest again Holdin' me down like a high school friend Says, "The world’s about to end, you best start swimming"You said, "Anxiety is the theme of all our lives these days"Can't even have my coffee without exploiting someone Or makin' another millionaire or billionaire What would it take to be happy I’d probably start with their money It's the clear backpacks, it's the two new fire exits, I'm buyin' a beer Don't wanna think of where I'm runnin' if another asshole takes a shot It’s the city burnin’ down while I stared at dirty pics you sent me And I'm hidin’ in the desert, but I taste the ocean in my snot Just tryin' to find my footing I know you're sick of walking Don't take me out back and shoot me I know my circuits are faulty Now I’ve only ever been a kid pointing out dead dogs on the road Take me down in a landslide Help me weather this high tide I'll wear you out waitin' for me to implode But don't take me out back and shoot meYou twenty-nine year panic attack And not the fashionable kind The kind where you wake up and say"Man, I just wanna survive"But this world is short on empathy You got out of your parents' place Started makin' money Crashed your car and now they want your laces And they gave you just enough To make you feel like you fucked up When you realized you couldn't keep yourself clean But kid, you're not half bad Could even be more than your dad So why're you complaining If they're not listening 'Cause we're just so fuckin' tired Of explaining ourselves We throw a pill down our throats Or ourselves into the ocean'Cause half our friends are dead The other half are depressed In this budget-rate life The borderline's lookin' thinWell, all I hear is, "Patience"All I have are missed bank payments I can't keep my head above the nonsense This ain't gonna make me famous But I can't eat off this paycheck My dreams are quick-dryin' cement Slippin' through the tips of my fingers Fill my pockets Cannonball into the black when I hear you say"It won't be this bleak forever" "It won't be this bleak forever" "It won't be this bleak forever" "It won't be this bleak forever" It's like I'm fallin' deeper and deeper Thinkin', "Someday I just need a miracle Need about thirty goddamn miracles"Well you say, "Be your own god"You say, "You're sane, so get yourself right So we can start again"I'm so preoccupied with my own life I can't see the world is burning down'Til we're living underwaterSaid, "It's the end of days And we're just hopin' for the beach front property"Numb with indecision Daring some asshole to take a swing Got eight hundred dollars To my name, not sure what it means Tryna take these bastards For a quarter of a million despite your mom's protesting If every city is the same Doom and gloom under a different name Maybe we should find our home in one I hate the rhythm of our lives these days Stare into a dead space shoutin' at my phone Duckin' in my seat 'cause someone brought a bag into the movie theater Everyone shrugs at the same time, yeah, yeah, we know You're sick and sad there are thirty-somethings in a bar Play us some nostalgia songs'Cause no one really wants to hear about you anymore I know If every city is the same Doom and gloom under a different name Maybe we should find our home in one We argue and assign the blame Not like any of us feel the shame Count on one hand all the good we've doneWell I’m supposed to be stoic As I wipe the tears off of my face Watch the ships off the coast of Mexico Block it out as they roll away I still see you smiling Even as I’m selfish as I’ve ever been See you sitting in your chair I see you singing happy birthday I got the call in June But couldn’t bring myself to see you Or even get you on the phone I wanted you to remember me in perfection But really I, I’m just a fucking coward I couldn’t stand to see you die And I was dealing with my own shit If I’m being honest, mom said you’d understand But I don’t blame you if you didn’t And I’m on the docks again Looking out at that awful ocean Watching the tide take you away I know you ain’t resting your bones I know you ain’t made it back home At least the loneliness gave you a break
