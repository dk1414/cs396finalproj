about beauty And we sing about truth At ten thousand dollars a show We take all kind of pills That give us all kind of thrills But the thrill we've never known Is the thrill that'll get ya When you get your picture On the cover of the Rolling Stone Wanna see my picture on the cover Wanna buy five copies for my mother  Wanna see my smilin' face On the cover of the Rolling Stone When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it's hard When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard Everybody wants her, everybody loves her Everybody wants to take your baby home When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch your friends When you're in love with a beautiful woman it never ends You know that its crazy and you don't wanna trust her Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone Maybe it's just an ego problem, problem is I've been fooled before By fair-weathered friends and faint-hearted lovers And every time it happens it just convinces me moreWhen your body's had enough of me And I'm layin' flat out on the floor When you think I've loved you all I can I'm gonna love you a little bit more Come on over here and lay by my side I've got to be touchin' you Let me rub your tired shoulders The way I used to do Look into my eyes and give me that smile The one that always turns me on And let me take your hair down Cause we're stayin' up to greet the sun And when your body's had enough of me And I'm layin flat out on the floor When you think I've loved you all I can I'm gonna love you a little bit more Got to say a few things that have been on my mind And you know where my mind has been I guess I learned my lessons And now's the time to beginStorms never last do they baby Bad times all pass with the wind Your hand in mine stills the thunder And you make the sun wanna shine You followed me down so many roads, baby I picked wild flowers and sung you soft sad songs And every road we took lord knows our search was for the truth And the clouds brewing now won't be the last But storms never last do they baby Bad times all pass with the wind Your hand in mine  stills the thunder And you make the sun wanna shine Storms never last  do they baby The bad times, the bad times, the bad times all pass Your hand in mine  stills the thunder You make the sun wanna shine Second Street and Broadway, sittin' in a door way Head held in his hands Looked to all the world, like he was prayin'Oh nah Foot wrapped in an old rag, bottle in a brown bag I saw him try to stand Then I heard the words, that he was sayin'Oh yeah And he said come on Carrie, carry me a little farther Come on Carrie, carry me one more mile I don't know where it's leadin' to But I know I can make it if I lean on you, so Come on Carrie, carry me a little, yes I carried you, now carry me a little Come on Carrie, carry me a little while, yeah, oh no Oh no Well he struggled to his feet, and staggered down the street To the window of the five-and-dime, oh He stood and laughed a while at his reflection, yeah Yeah nah YeahThe mornin' sun touched lightly on The eyes of Lucy Jordon In her white suburban bedroom In a white suburban town As she lay there 'neath the covers Dreaming of a thousand lovers'Til the world turned to orange And the room went spinnin' round At the age of 37 She realised she'd never ride through Paris In a sports car, with the warm wind in her hair And she let the phone keep ringin'As she sat there softly singin'Pretty nursery rhymes She'd memorised In her daddy's easy chair Her husband, he was off to work And the kids were off to school And there were oh so many ways For her to spend her day She could clean the house for hours Or rearrange the flowers Or run naked down the shady street Screaming all the wayHey, that's really tight You know we worked a long time on this Yeah, hell, it really should be our time Let's try it again Elvis, he's a hero, he's a superstar And I hear that Paul Mc Cartney drives a Rolls Royce car And Dylan sings for millions and I just sing for free Oh, everybody's makin' it big but me]Oh, everybody's makin' it big but me Everybody's makin' it big but me Neil Diamond sings for diamonds and here's ol' rhinestone me Oh, everybody's makin' it big but me Well I hear that Alice Cooper's got a foxy chick To wipe off his snake, and keep him rich And Elton John's got two fine ladies and Doctor John's got three And I'm still seein' them same ol' sleazos that I used to see
