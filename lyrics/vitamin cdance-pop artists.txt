And so we talked all night about the rest of our lives Where we're gonna be when we turn twenty-five I keep thinking times will never change Keep on thinking things will always be the same But when we leave this year we won't be coming back No more hanging out 'cause we're on a different track And if you got something that you need to say You better say it right now 'cause you don't have another day 'Cause we're moving on and we can't slow down These memories are playing like a film without sound And I keep thinking of that night in June I didn't know much of love, but it came too soon And there was me and you and then we got real blue Stay at home talking on the telephone with me We'd get so excited and we'd get so scared Laughing at ourselves thinking life's not fair And this is how it feels As we go on We remember All the times we Had together And as our lives change Come whatever We will still be Friends foreverI'm not that kind of girl who thinks I can change the world With just a simple twirl of my hair I'll never break your heart, tear your soul apart With just a simple spark from my stare Won't go playing with your insides Take your wallet for it's big size Won't be suckered in by those foolish games Oh, oh, I'm not that kind of girl Oh, oh, I'm not that kind of girl Oh, oh, I'm not that kind of girl Oh, oh, I'm not that kind of girl Kind of girl, kind of girl, kind of girl I'm not that of girl who think you can rule my world With just a simple wave of your hand So don't you push me down, or start to play around Cause when you see me frown, just beware Don't go playing with my insides Tell me stories, tell me big lies Won't be taken in by those silly games Oh, oh, I'm not that kind of girl Oh, oh, I'm not that kind of girl Oh, oh, I'm not that kind of girl Oh, oh, I'm not that kind of girl Kind of girl, kind of girl, kind of girlSometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears But you and I have our love always there to remind us There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us Volare, oh-oh Cantare, oh-oh-oh-oh Let's fly way up to the clouds Away from the maddening crowds We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of Where lovers enjoy peace of mind Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind Just like birds of a feather A rainbow together We'll find...Volare, oh-oh Cantare, oh-oh-oh-oh No wonder my happy heart sings Your love has given me wingsHahaha Alright, yeah Alright First of all...When you wake up in the evening and the day is shot Find yourself complaining about the things you ain't got Never goes just the way you want it to Cliché of the day, "c'est la vie", that's just life It ain't easy, it's so tough, it ain't easy Put a smile on your face Make the world a better place Put a smile on your face Put a smile on your face Make the world a better place Put a smile on your face You can say that I'm a dreamer and you think it's uncool Preaching about the better life I learned in school But you get what you give in this life that we live And all that you do will come back to you Life , it ain't easy It's so tough, It ain't easyDo, do do what, do do what, do do do what you like Do, do do what, do do what, do do do what you like You don't need to be 6 foot 3 You don't need to be friends with me You don't need to be on the internet Cruisin' around the halls like you're teacher's pet You don't need to run a marathon Fly a jet or have a big hit song You don't always need to have your way Double down or make a triple play Do what you want to do Whatever, whatever, whatever you choose Everybody wants to tell you what to do Just do what you want to do Whatever, whatever, whatever you do If you wanna get to me, you gotta get to you You don't need to have a navel ring You don't need to be able to sing You don't need to have a big tattoo Hanging with the boys like the last tycoon You don't need to be in the Guiness Book You don't need to be in therapy or a gourmet cook You don't need to win the Nobel Prize Play it safe and order super-sizeAlright, yeah Alright, first of all When you wake up in the evening and the day

It's so tough, It ain't easyYou know he was the type that never left me alone Until I really need to reach him on the telephone He was nowhere to be found he's hanging out with the boys Driving round around the city in his pretty new toy Never gonna get it together, uh, huh, uh, huh Never gonna make it much better, uh, huh, uh, huh Should I stay or should I go  Because I really need to know Or do I stick around and cry  'Cause now it's time to say goodbye I ain't got nobody that I can depend on Just me, myself, and I I ain't got nobody that I can depend on Then there was the one who couldn't make up his mind He's always checking every chicky at the checkout line He told me baby I'm just looking, but I never would touch Then I catch him with Alicia at the back of the bus Never gonna get any better, uh, huh, uh, huh Never gonna get it together, uh, huh, uh, huh Should I stay or should I go  Because I really need to know Or do I stick around and cry  'Cause now it's time to say
