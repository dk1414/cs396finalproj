thorn in my pride Angels they, devils they, a thorn in my pride My angels, my devils, my thorn in my pride Angels they, devils, they're a thorn in my pride Pride, a thorn in my prideCheat the odds

baby, just you watch my head spin The spectacle that made you cry It's a thrill-a-minute plane ride It's over time at ring side, no lie March me down to the seven seas Bury me with a ruby ring Kiss me, baby, on an Easter Sunday day Make my haze blow away Aw, make it blow away I hide, I seek, I go and I find Truth in a fable, faith in a rhyme So why they want to bad talk me Are they surprised by what we see Like my table and my tide turn Like on my bed, the emperor worn Ooh, is that enough for me, it could be March me down to the seven seas Bury me with a ruby ring Kiss me, baby, on an Easter Sunday day Make my haze blow away I say, make it blow awayTo lessen my troubles I stopped hanging out with vultures And empty saviors like you Oh, I wish I had a nickel For every miracle That you easily tricked me into You can lead a horse to water But faith is another matter So don't you surrender Cause sometimes salvation In the eye of the storm I've no time for accusations Or conversations On all the bad, bad things you do Just a note from the jailor Drugs and the relations To all the people around you You can lead a horse to water But faith is another matter So don't you surrender Cause sometimes salvation In the eye of the stormWith my winter time My idols and stage fright In another night Where the lights are loud and bright One dream from waking up saved Too shy to hold in the rage I know no luxury Of knowing what your eyes read I know one million ways To always pick the wrong thing to say A love that you never gave Always a time zone away No, it's not out of spite Oh, I just know what's right So that's why Bad luck, blue eyes GoodbyeWorried sick, my eyes are hurting To rest, rest my head, I'll take a life'Cause you know that outside, the girls are dancing And when you're down, it don't ever, ever seem right Feeling second fiddle to a dead man I've had it up to my neck with some people's disregard And like a beat dog, baby, that's walking right outside down Peachtree No one ever wants to hear it, hear it when you're down Sister luck is screaming out Somebody else's name Sister luck, oh, got to scream out Somebody else's name, oh, that's a shame A flip of a coin Might make a head turn But there's no, there's no surprise, baby, who can sleep But you held my hand right over a candle Flame on it burnt me, I never did weep
