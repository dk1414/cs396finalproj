Sit there thinking In your room You feel the pressure You're going crazy too The walls around you Closing in You need a change Claustrophobic Feeling scared You need somebody But no one seems to care A one way ticket A change of pace You've had enough Can't take no more Breaking the chains around you Nobody else can bind you Take a good look around you Now you're breaking the chains Got this letter Came today From my baby Who left me yesterday Said she loves me She'll come back She wants to tryI'd like to see you in the morning light I'd like to feel you when it comes tonight Now I'm here and I'm all alone Still I know how it feels I'm alone again Tried so hard to make you see But I couldn't find the words Now the tears, they fall like rain I'm alone again without you Alone again without you Alone again without you Alone again without you I said stay, but you turned away Tried to say that it was me Now I'm here and I've lost my way Now I know how it feels I'm alone again Tried so hard to make you see But I couldn't find the words Now the tears, they fall like rain I'm alone again without you Alone again without you Alone again without you Alone again without youI lie awake and dread the lonely nights I'm not alone I wonder if these heavy eyes Can face the unknown When I close my eyes, I realize You'll come my way I'm standin' in the night alone Forever together We're the dream warriors Don't wanna dream no more We're the dream warriors And maybe tonight Maybe tonight you'll be gone I feel the touch comin' over me I can't explain I hear the voices callin' out Callin' my name It's the same desire to feel the fire That's comin' your way I'm standin' in the night alone Forever togetherIn my dreams It's still the same Your love is strong It still remains Toss and turn all night In the sheets But I can't sleep Night after night Don't know what it means In my dreams What can I say or do You won't come back We're through I've realized too late That, baby, your love has turned away In my dreams It's still the same Your love is strong It still remains In my dreams You're still by me Just the way it used to beTold you i had to leave, i had my reasons I said that it hurt to stay, the way that i'm feelin'It's not love That left you standin'It's not love That left you cold It's not love Misunderstandin'Only a mistake There's nothing left to take Why, baby, why did you make me let you go And leave you so lonely Why, baby, why did you have to hold on You know it's not love anymore Gave you your last chance but you didn't believe me You can't keep me satisfied, the way that you treat me It's not love That left you standin'It's not love That left you cold It's not love Misunderstandin'Only a mistake There's nothing left to takeA brief encounter Like wind through the trees It came so suddenly But then it was gone Like it had never been How could I have ever seen A lost heart Will take your soul How could I have known How could I have known As she took me in her arms And brought me to an end With the kiss of death The kiss of death She promised paradise As she lied upon her bed Like a fallen angel With the devil's charm She promised paradise With the kiss of death I tried to stop As she held out her hand But the fire was burnin' inside She knew what I wanted She gave it and more But now I must pay the price We were strangers Passin' in the nightYou weave your spell Your eyes they beckon me Your lips they speak, lies and misery I know it's wrong, but I can't turn away The flames draw near, they're telling me to stay I'm falling I'm falling Into the fire Into the fire Into the fire I'm falling Into the fire Your love burns bright, and yet the flames are cold This time I fear, you won't be back no more When will it end, your love consumes my soul Into the fire, I'm being tempted once more I'm falling I'm fallingClouds roll by as I look to the sky And then that feeling comes, it comes on again You know desire burns like a fire, fire of sin Oh, will I ever learn You're the only one I would call my own But then the shadows fall and I'm gone again I'm a hunter Searching for love On these lonely streets again I'm the hunter Searching for the things That I might never find again Care for you, you know that I always will I know it's hard for you, my taste for the kill But then it calls to me when the moon rises full in the sky You know it's not denied Will I ever find love and peace of mind On these streets again, will it ever end I'm a hunter Searching for love On these lonely streets again I'm the hunter Searching for the things That I might never find againThe lights go down You can feel it all around you Like a razor's edge that cuts through the air You can hear the sound It's coming down like thunder You don't have to tell me why You don't have to care When the lightnin' strikes again And the lights go down And you might be near the end When the lightnin' strikes again You draw the line And you leave it all behind you You lost your mind and then you lose control By the time That you feel the lightnin' strike you You know you've been holding back You've got to let it goSit there thinking In your room You feel the pressure You're going crazy too The walls around you Closing in You need a change Claustrophobic Feeling scared You need somebody But no one seems to care A one way ticket A change of pace You've had enough Can't take no more Breaking the chains around you Nobody else can bind you Take a good look around you Now you're breaking the chains Got this letter Came
