the days when we were alive Trapped inside this hole of mine no guidance from the great divine He helps simple men...but simple men don't know they can!Now in a daze the light has arrived I'm feeling the pain that you have derived It's a boring song...but it will decide whether I go on!What can I say that hasn't been said What can I say that hasn't been said It's up to you Lord, it's up to you But do I still have time to choose I am liking what you provide Lord if you hear me, I'm falling down, yeah If I don't follow after you What happens then, will I still lose My faith is weary, my soul is
