with care In hopes that St Nicholas soon would be there The children were nestled all snug in their beds While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter Away to the window I flew like a flash Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below When, what to my wondering eyes should appear But a miniature sleigh, and eight tinny reindeer With a little old driver, so lively and quick I knew in a moment it must be St Nick More rapid than eagles his coursers they came And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!"Now Dasher  now, Dancer  now, Prancer and Vixen!On, Comet  On, Cupid  on, on Donner and Blitzen!To the top of the porch  to the top of the wall!Now dash away  Dash away  Dash away all!"I will
