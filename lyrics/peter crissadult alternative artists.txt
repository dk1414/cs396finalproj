Since I found you You make me understand That when I walk in alone, I know you'll be there at home I'm no longer afraid That if I open my heart, someone will tear it apart Baby, till the day I met you Honey, I was lost And I can't forget you nowHave you ever been locked in a spaceship Lost in the sky Flying high above highways Still trapped in the sky I know the meaning of success Whoa, but you gotta believe Evil has a way of showing its fine face Still you gotta believe Time has a way of standing still for you Only to go up to fall down Have you ever been locked in a spaceship And lost in your lies Flying high above the highways Still trapped in the skies I know the meaning of success Oh, but you got to believe Evil has a way of showing its face Oh, but you got to believe So, you fly into the darkness Using the stars for your lights And you finally found your planet Time to set things rightThis is New York, yo It's getting dark Night falls on the city Finds me all alone Makes me wonder Should I just go on home And I walk up the stairs To see if you're still there Would you mind if I found you alone Then a cold wind came callin'Strange how it knew me by my name See the night would fade But the pain's gonna stay Makes me wonder How you ever made love to me I can't stop the rain, here it comes again Lightnin' strikes across the sky Oh, I can't stop the rain, here it comes again Lightnin' only blinds my eyesThe boy could play before he learned to grow Worked in a band who had no name at all Every mornin' at the break of dawn You could see him draggin' home his drums I was vaccinated with a Victrola needle And I'm hooked on rock 'n' roll They called the family doctor to see what he could do Doc said, "No, you can't cure his soul Once he's infected with the blues"So I travel 'round from town to town singin' out the news I was vaccinated with a Victrola needle And I'm hooked on rock 'n' roll When you find you got no mind to Work from nine to five Find the backbeat, set your heart free And feel that music runnin' through your feet Mama told me long ago"Ain't no future in that rock 'n' roll"And I said, "Hey, mama It's burnin' hot inside my soul"Love, love is so hard Love is so hard to find When love is such an easy thing Such an easy thing Such an easy thing to lose, yeah Words, words are so hard Words are so hard to find When love's such an easy thing Such an easy thing Such an easy thing to lose, yeah When you find your love Will you know it's real When you lose it all Will you really feel that love Love is so hard Love is so hard to find'Cause love's such an easy thing Such an easy thing Such an easy thing to lose, yeah When you find your love Will you know it's real When you lose it all Will you really feel that love I didn't want you, did not need you Sure wouldn't mean to kick you down You know I love you, I'm thinkin' of you Sure do wish you'd come around'Cause you're the kind of sugar papa likes And when you do it, it drives me crazy And I don't know if I'm up or down Lost or found with you You shoulda told me, I'm not the only Man to love you twice But since I know now, I think I'll go now And find someone who'll love me right'Cause you're the kind of sugar papa likes And when we do it, it drives me crazy And I don't know if I'm up or down Lost or found with you But you're the kind of sugar papa likes And when you do it, it drives me crazy Well, I don't know if I'm up or down Lost or found with you
