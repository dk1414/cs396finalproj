Hold me close and hold me fast The magic spell you cast This is "La vie en rose"When you kiss me, heaven sighs And though I close my eyes I see "La vie en rose"When you press me to your heart I'm in a world apart A world where roses bloom And when you speak, angels sing from above Everyday words seem to turn into love songs Give your heart and soul to me And life will always be"La vie en rose"I see trees of green, red roses too I see them bloom for me and you And I think to myself What a wonderful world I see skies of blue and clouds of white The bright blessed days, the dark sacred nights And I think to myself What a wonderful world The colors of the rainbow So pretty in the sky Are also on the faces Of people going by I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do "They're really saying, "I love you"I hear babies cry, I watch them grow They'll learn much more Than I'll ever know And I think to myself What a wonderful world Yes, I think to myself What a wonderful worldStars shining bright above you Night breezes seem to whisper, I love you Birds singin' in the sycamore trees Dream a little dream of me Say nighty-night and kiss me Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me While I'm alone and blue as can be Dream a little dream of me Stars fading but I linger on dear Still craving your kiss Now I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear Just saying this Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you But in your dreams whatever they be Dream a little dream of me Stars fading but I linger on dear Still craving your kiss I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear Just saying thisI went down to St  James Infirmary Saw my baby there She was stretched out on a long white table So cold, so sweet, so fair Let her go, let her go!God bless her wherever she may be She can look this wide world over But she'll never find a sweet man like me When I die bury me in straight lace shoes I want a box-back coat and a Stetson hat Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain So the boys will know that I died standin' patGo down, Moses Way down in Egypt's land Tell old Pharaoh to Let my people go When Israel was in Egypt's land Let my people go Oppress'd so hard they could not stand Let my people go So the Lord said:“Go down, Moses Way down in Egypt's land Tell old Pharaoh to Let my people go”So Moses went to Egypt's land Let my people go He made old Pharaoh understand Let my people go Yes, the Lord said:“Go down, Moses Way down in Egypt's land Tell old Pharaoh to Let my people go”Give me a kiss to build a dream on And my imagination will thrive upon that kiss Sweetheart, I ask no more than this A kiss to build a dream on Give me a kiss before you leave me And my imagination will feed my hungry heart Leave me one
