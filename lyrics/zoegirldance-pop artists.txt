Give me one reason to live without Him Give me one reason to walk away I know you don't understand this feeling How can I show That He is the reason I have to let you go I've tried so hard to change your mind I always thought that you'd understand the reasons why Why I don't want to do the things that I used to do Now that my heart and my soul belong to God and God alone Still every night's a fight to make it through I can't deny I'm still in love with you But how can you expect me to Walk with Him and give myself to you Give me one reason to live without Him Give me one reason to walk away I know you don't understand this feeling How can I show That He is the reason I have to let you go Boy, I still long for your embrace But what I've found in God, oh, it could never ever be replaced Still I pray for the chance As you slip through my hands you'll come around But your heart's so far away from the words I'm trying to sayI had an angel that sat on my shoulder Seems like everybody's got one I had the devil waiting on standby For when I wanted to have some fun Thought that I was living forever I thought that my smile would get me in Never felt the wave that was coming Never thought the party would end No, no, no, no...Chorus Little did I know That you were all I needed Little did I see Until you opened up my eyes Little did I know That one prayer could reach you Little did I know That you'd even care I had my daddy wrap 'round my finger Tp never make my momma cry Nothin but smiles on the outside But all the while living a lie If you ask me "Are you going to heaven "I'll say you know I've been a good good girl I'm gonna spend all my money on makeup And a find a boy who will buy me the worldStranded in the middle of a hurricane I've got an umbrella but nowhere to stay Do I give up now  Do I face the cold I better get some boldness!Looking to the left I see it coming I'm alone and I'm scared and it's heading my way Do I run  Do I hide  Do I dare close my eyes Do I face the fear inside Time after time Lord I'll keep running back to You, keep running back to You I realize this time that I'll be fine!Even if the stars fell like rain Even if tomorrow never came Even if the world I know should crumble Nothing's gonna stand in my way!Even if the sun left the sky And even if these tears never dry Even if the mountains fall and tumble If what's left of me is taken I will not be shaken!Landed in the middle of the desert And I'm wondering why what keeps me alive When the water I drink and the air that I breathe is dryDoes anybody know how I feel Sometimes I'm numb, sometimes I'm overcome Does anybody care what's going on Do I have to wear my scars like a badge on my arm For you to see me, I need release Do I have to scream for you to hear me Do I have to bleed for you to see me 'Cause I grieve, you're not listening to me Do I need to scream Has anybody seen what's been done Where was my defense  No one heard my protest The eyes of God were watching me It's time to make my peace, let it go and be released So I can breathe again I'm on my knees I've been marked, set apart But I'm cut so deep and afraid of the dark One drop of blood from the hole in Your hand Is enough to heal me and make me stand'Cause I'm clean, He is listening to me I don't have to scream for Him to hear me Don't have to bleed for Him to see me'Cause I'm clean, He is listening to me I don't have to scream I don't have to bleed'Cause I'm clean, He is listening And I don't have to screamI used to close my eyes and pray the time would pass me by So I could fly away in my dreams to anywhere unreal And I'd hide away from everything I didn't know what was real, I didn't know the truth There was a day when somebody introduced me to You And You breathed Your life in me You set me free...Now I'll shout it from the mountain That I'm not the same that I used to be I believe in God, believe in God I'm not ashamed to talk about it To a world that slowly slips away That I believe in God, believe in God Now at the end of the day when nothing seems to go my way I've got a friend, I've got a love that's never gonna let me go Since You gave Your life for me You set me free...Now I'll shout it from the mountain That I'm not the same that I used to be I believe in God, believe in God I'm not ashamed to talk about it To a world that slowly slips away That I believe in God, believe in GodI know that you've been thinking I see it in your eyes You're holding on to something But still you don't know why So walk by faith and not by what you see Trust your heart and let yourself believe I can do things, things you never knew Change your world, make it all brand new I can do miracles if you want me to Anything is possible for you Anything, anything, anything, anything is possible Repeat I know your heart's been broken You feel so all alone But I will never leave you lonely I'll never let you go So walk by faith and not by what you see It's up to you to let your heart believe I can do things, things you never knew Change your world, make it all brand new I can do miracles if you want me to Anything is possible for youYou have never changed your ways You think that you can own me like a slave And I want to walk away But every time I try you're in my face You say, I could have it all Trust you, you will never let me fall And my heart feels bound to your control But my spirit says, no, no, no Stop right there Suddenly temptation's flying Everywhere And you think you've got me down Well think again, I'm not your friend It's plain to see, I'm not your property Stop right there Suddenly temptation's flying Everywhere And you think you've got me down Well think again, I'm not your friend Don't play with me, I'm not your property Ring  Brrlp  It's you once again Begging me to listen to your plan But you see I've found the truth'Cause I have been redeemed and so we're through You say, I could have it all Trust you, you will never let me fall I don't have to give into your demands The power's not in your handsSolo, lonely and afraid Hold on, something's bound to break Falling down, running from the promised land Midnight, and I'm still awake Don't feel right, haven't slept for days I'm so tired my thoughts are getting weak And I'm wired, can I get some peace Suddenly you are here with me Finding a reason to believe I know you'll be here to the end of time And when the night falls all around My frightened heart the only sound I know you'll be here to the end of time Maybe it was my mistakes That kept on pulling me away I was still living yesterday The message that I want to relay Without Him, there's no other way So don't try to make it on your own When you're lost, He will lead you home Suddenly you are here with me Finding a reason to believe I know you'll be here to the end of time And when the night falls all around My frightened heart the only sound I know you'll be here to the end of timeThere was a time when I'd believe in anything but You I closed my eyes and let You in Ready to let my life begin It just hit me, couldn't ignore it Heard Your voice calling now I know it I wanna see Your face I wanna speak Your name I wanna tell the whole world how my life has changed I'm gonna lift my voice Ever to sing Your praise As long as I'm alive know that I I'm living for You Lord, here I stand before You now I want to give You everything No matter what may come my way You give me a smile they can't take away Holding onto all You brought me through You're the strength that I'll always cling to I wanna see Your face I wanna speak Your name I wanna tell the whole world how my Life has changed I'm gonna lift my voice Ever to sing Your praise As long as I'm alive know that I I'm living for YouEverybody's searching for something Something that they can call their own Wishing, hoping, waiting for empty skieds to open up But they don't What's up with all the obsession What's in and what's out That's what it's about Still we dream of better Fearing nothing's gonna ever be right, yeah All along, don't you know that you can't break free Take a look and see what's your reality Upside down, spining round and round Happiness may not be what it seems Inside out, alone whithout a doubt Is your heart until he sets you free From all of this reality Oh, you know the world is so crazy It'll chew you up, spit you out Leave you feeling empty inside Filling your head with little white lies Jesus is the only reason that my heart is free to say You could dream a thousand dreams and have a million things But nothing could replace the love that jesus gave
