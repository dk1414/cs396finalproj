In the end As we fade into the night Who will tell the story of your life In the end As my soul's laid to rest What is left of my body Or am I just a shell And I have fought And with flesh and blood I commanded an army Through it all I have given my heart for a moment of glory In the end As we fade into the night Who will tell the story of your life And who will remember your last goodbye Cause it's the end and I'm not afraid I'm not afraid to die I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid to die Born a saint Though with every sin I still wanna be holy I will live again Who we are Isn't how we live we are more than our bodies If I fall I will rise back up and relive my gloryOh o-oh, Wake up!Oh o-oh, Wake up!All we know is time It's slipping from our lives A world that kept the truth Hidden in the lies Standing on the stage Bleeding out our youth Create a holy war And sell it back to you We'll shout it from the tallest building We, won't let them turn away We'll show them what they made We'll be here when their heart stops beating We the nation of today Our hearts that never fade We'll be here when the heart stops beating Oh o-oh, Wake up!Oh o-oh, Wake up Alone at last we can sit and fight And I've lost all faith in this blurring light Stay right here we can change our plight Storming through this despite what's right One final fight for this tonight, whoa-oh-oh With knives and pens, we made our plight Lay your heart down, the end's in sight Conscience begs for you to do what's right Every day it's still the same dull knife Stab it through and justify your pride One final fight for this tonight, whoa-oh-oh With knives and pens we made our plight, whoa-oh-oh And I can't go on without your love, you lost, you never held on We tried our best, turn out the light, turn out the light!One final fight for this tonight, whoa-oh-oh With knives and pens we made our plight, whoa-oh-ohMy mind remains my pain I'm tied down to this chain It spirals as I ache To find holy embrace Stay with me, I'm afraid of my soul Blackened and left in control Cannot be free and you can't deny The end is coming, the end is coming Will we live  When we die Just keep on saving our goodbyes The fear and the cost The world will stain us with a scarlet cross A symbol for my shame The color of your name It's how they see you break And live with my mistakes Sin for me, cast away from it all Watching every letter fall Hold onto me, and I can't let go The end is coming, th–µ end is comingYeah!This wall of stone That they built to cage our minds Grip the gun of changing times Like no one's home They will burn down every bridge Spread the word of ignorance All blind to your eyes Forget the innocent Say a prayer, every night All we hear must be right I am the outsider Living life for the end Nothing left to defend I am the outsider I'm not the hope That's just wishing for the past Like bringing Christ back from the ash Could save the world They have risen for the sins Of missing why we can't begin A night in this timeI'm gonna get out if it's the last thing that I do And in my heart my fifteen minutes are burned through I won't come back To fall off track The way that I survived It's a violent world, but today I'm still alive I need you to tell me everything will be alright To chase away the voices in the night When they call my name Have I gone insane These thoughts will kill me and everything that I hold true And as I grow, I let my fear replace my youth I won't turn back I won't cross that hidden danger line It's a loud and dark world But I think I found the light I need you to tell me everything will be alright To chase away the voices in the night When they call my name Have I gone insane I need you to tell me everything will be alright To chase away the voices in the night When they call my name Have I gone insane I need you to tell me everything will be alright To chase away the voices in the night When they call my name Have I gone insane We've built it up just to fall apart Try to leave them wanting more As we scream and we fight, carry on through the night But the problem is never the cure Every day we try to be better than the lies and the sins I will love all the hate, feel like one in the same I only sink before I swim I swear this time is gonna be the last one Gonna be the last one, oh woah ho This time is gonna be the last one Gonna be the last one, oh woah ho I'll forget all the dreams that we told our hearts And the pain that's there to start Try to find what is safe from the scars that replace Like a faithful that converts I swear this time is gonna be the last one Gonna be the last one, oh woah ho This time is gonna be the last one Gonna be the last one, oh woah ho I'm standing ground We sing it out The legion of the underground This time is gonna be the last one Gonna be the last one, oh woah hoHere I am, your Judas Christ And I bleed from the heart that saved your life Blurry vision when your eyes are gone But I see every word you string along Are you the saint that burned the gods of man Hard to stand when no one gives a damn Not alone, just not one of them Your shadow The fight, heaven hasn't ended So I swear that I'll protect it Time is the soldier, keep marching closer To fields of bone Every word in our final verse We sing to the blessed and the cursed Hard to picture where we all belong And if we have the strength to carry on Am I the saint  Take me by the hand Hard to trust when no one understands You're alone in the eyes of man No shadowScream  Shout!Scream  Shout!We are the fallen angels!We are the in between Cast down as sons of war Struck to the earth like lightning On this world we're torn We won't cause the pain Of living out their law Take joy in who you are We know our wings are flawed We're bored to death in heaven And down alone in hell We only want to be ourselves We scream , we shout We are the fallen angels We scream , we shout Woah woah oh oh oh oh To those who sing alone No need to feel this sorrow We scream , we shout Woah We are the fallen angelsI ruled the world With these hands I shook the heavens to the ground I laid the gods to rest I held the key to the kingdom Lions guarding castle walls Hail the king of death Then I lost it all Dead and broken My back's against the wall Cut me open I'm just trying to breathe Just trying to figure it out Because I built these walls to watch them crumbling down I said, then I lost it all And who can save me now I stood above Another war Another jewel upon the crown I was the fear of men But I was blind I couldn't see the world there right in front of me But now I can
