Baby, I know you're wondering Why I won't go over to your place'Cause I'm not too sure 'bout how you feel So I'd rather go at my own pace And I know and you know that if we get together Emotions will go to work And I may do something I might regret the next day And end up hurt Oh, I don't know That's the way that I feel I'm so afraid of a one night deal I wonder if I take you home Would you still be in love, baby Because I need you tonight I wonder if I take you home Would you still be in love, baby Because I need you tonight, huh-ho Your love is.. Hit the beat now Lost in emotion Some guys will promise you A marriage made in heaven But I'm gonna stick to my guns Like waiting for that love That I might be getting My dreams have yet begun, oh, baby Am I a fool 'cause I don't know just how you feel And this love for you, oh I can't conceal, oh I'm...I'm lost in emotion Telling you things you really shouldn't know I'm baby, I'm lost in emotion Am I a fool At least my friends think so Que sera, que sera Baby, whatever will be Que sera, que sera Between you and me Just how true are the rumors I am hearing About the crush you have on me  Oh baby I'm blind 'cause I just don't see it But I wanna believe what they see I find myself telling you things I don't even tell my best friend I keep showing emotions Not knowing just where it all stems fromAll alone on a Sunday morning Outside I see the rain is falling Inside I'm slowly dying But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying And you...Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies All I needed was a simple hello But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear my cry I...I gave you my love in vain My body never knew such pleasure My heart never knew such pain And you...You leave me so confused Now I'm all cried out Over you Never wanted to see things your way, I had to go astray Oh, why was I such a fool Now I see that the grass is greener, is it too late for me To find my way home  How could I be so wrong Leaving me all aloneCan you feel the beat within my heart Can't you see my love shine through dark Can you feel the beat within my heart Can't you see my love shine through dark Can't you see that you must be a part Of that beat in my heart That beat in my heart Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ahh Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ahh After all that we've been through I can't seem to face the fact that, boy, I'm losing you I threw away all ties with those venetian blinds I looked and saw my heart just overrule my mind And I've tried not to let it show Now I don't know what to do, told myself I'm lying So let's not just let it go My heart does double beats for you, ooh Now you know my love won't come close
