model, wants to be on the tube Yeah, it's one thing or another She's trouble, trouble Watch out if you're near She could bring you to tears She's got two boyfriends and three wannabes They follow her around like she's Aphrodite She's number one rated, but she's already jaded She's following the trends in her Mercedes Benz Everyone wants to know her name Walking down the hall, she's every guy's dream I hate the homecoming queen I'm pretty damn sure she can't stand me She thinks she's on the cover of a magazine I hate the homecoming queen tonight That's right Non-fat, sugar free, mochachini She says, "Give it to me now, you can keep the receipt"Drinking one after the other She's trouble, trouble Tossing back her hair and she just don't careYou pull up outside with your hot headlights And you're walking up the stairs with a girl on each side Go in the door like a thunderstorm go and Crash boom boom with the lights on the dance floor We get down, we get down, we got down We get down, we get down, we got down All the girls want boys, boys And all the boys want someone to let them go All the girls want boys, boys And all the boys want someone to let them go Taking her time 'cause he's on the chase So she's stringing him along And she's getting in his head space Clinical form with their jaws on the floor And the girls keep score While the boy's in back burnYou know I used to hear a voice that said Trouble's coming, better stay in bed Then I even tried to run away'Cause I didn't even know my own strength I was shocked, no, I couldn't believe My world rocked, it was news to me When I looked in the mirror today I looked back and I heard me say I gotta own it, breathe it, live it like I mean it There's a hero in me, it's all I wanna be Someone to rely on, looks good on T VSave the day, it's part of the routine Out of my way, this is the job for me I could fly if I just had the cape X-ray vision would be cool one day Meet the power, come on, feel the rush You'd better look out for my one, two, flip, hey!Now I got my own boots to fill New identity, what a thrill Break it down, gonna right the wrongs In my mind, I can hear my theme songI like to bite my nails and play the air guitar I like to keep my suitcase packed 'cause I'm going far I think you're nice, but I don't wanna waste my time I may seem crazy, but don't worry, I'm just fine All the way up, all the way down Never look back, it's time to breakout Want it my way, I do what I do I know what I like, and maybe it's you That's right It's a temporary life It's a ride that takes you All the way up, all the way down Never look back, it's time to breakout I like to go out walking in the pouring rain I want my rock 'n' roll to make the window shake I wait 'til 3 AM to call everyone I know I'm gonna bring the noise I'm ready, here we go All the way up, all the way down Never look back, it's time to breakout Want it my way, I do what I do I know what I like, and maybe it's you That's right It's a temporary life It's a ride that takes you All the way up, all the way down Never look back, it's time to breakoutThe city is sleepin', but I'm still awake I'm dreamin', I'm thinkin'What happened today, is it right I fold into the night The flashbacks, the pictures The letters and songs The memories, the heart that you carved on the wall It's a shame Now that nothing's the same Now the bridges are burned And we're lost in the wind It's time that we sink or swim What about you What about me What about fairy tale endings Were you just pretending to be I'm wondering What if we tried What if I cried What if it's better tomorrow What if I followed your eyes I'm wondering What about me
