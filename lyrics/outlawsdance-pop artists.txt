In a place you always dream of, where your soul is always free Silver stages, golden curtains, filled my head plain as could be As a rainbow grew around the sun, all my stars above, who died Came somewhere beyond the scene you see These lovely people played for me Now, if I let you see this place where stories all ring true Will you let me past your face to see what's really you It's not for me I ask this question as though I were a king!For you have to love, believe and feel Before the burst of tambourines take you there Green grass and high tides forever Castles of stone, soul, and glory Lost faces say we adore you As kings and queens bow and play for you Those who don't believe me, find your souls and set them free Those who do, believe and know that time will be your key Time and time again I've thanked them for a peace of mind That helped me find myself amongst the music and the rhyme That enchants you thereIn a place you always dream of, where your soul is always free
