rent, I can't account for how my days are spent, I wanna draw the Line between who I am and who I invent Without you, I've been standing 'round like a statue, laying on the floor thinking about you, I talk To myself like the crazies do, otherwise I'm great, what about you Yea, what about you The weatherman says blue skies but it's raining like the clouds all decided to cry, and every time You hurt me I say "it's all right it's all right it's all right"Without you, I've been standing 'round, you're like a statue, laying on the couch all day like cats Do, waiting for the phone to ring, but it won't ring Without you, I've been standing 'round like a statue, laying on the floor thinking about you, I talk To myself like the crazies do, otherwise I'm great, what about you What about you What
