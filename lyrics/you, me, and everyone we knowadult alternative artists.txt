There was a time when I thought that I would never be this close with anyone A leather lesson and the harshest words I was abused at 10 out in the hot pacific sun There was the time I came to your side It was 3 A MAnd you were begging me to die Another year was all it took for you to forget The best friend that always carried you So why are you still saying I'm not when I already am You keep on kicking me down You keep on kicking me down And why are you still saying we won't when we already are You keep on kicking me down You keep on kicking me down Ain't it a shame to be so young and insane Ain't it a shame to be so young and insane I used to love what I used to love Moving on was a chore I was never quite ready for They used to say I was a cautious man It's been weeks since I looked both ways or gave a damn There was the time I came to your side It was 3 A MAnd you were begging me to die Another year was all it took for you to forget The best friend that always carried youWe're at the tip-top, yeah, we're not getting any better than this I'm out of lines, girl, we're not getting any smoother than this But could you blame me if I...if I...if I...Took you all for prisoner with just one line, one lie Because I'll be the preacher to all his converts"Donate now to my rightful cause."But what good is a quick healing to go If the lesson's never learned it's just like stitches for show They say the Carolina heat Isn't something that keeping a cool head can beat But don't discount their winter winds And all the cold shoulders that the slightest draft lets in And with empty stomachs and hungry eyes Our only choice was to swallow pride But I guess, I guess you just ate much better than the rest We're at the ground floor But our numbers they only get higher from here It's not the failure, but the cost of success Is the thing I can't help but fear This isn't righteous, it's a mid-life crisis I'm not compelled, you just convinced me to write this It's for the greater good, 'cause I'd rather be great than goodWhen will my hands be clean of you You’re still the ants but I am fireproof I hold my breath, you take a purple hue Until my hands are clean of you I am  fermenting in negative energy fervently inviting new enemies facing impossibly narrow entry Back into an atmosphere that nearly thrice killed me I did not survive the third rotation A concussion interrupted phosphorylation It took another hard fall to heal my brain Though I wouldn’t call what I’ve been feeling completely sane I’m still having those dreams at night My blood pressure stays prepared for a fight Now that all my dreams are dead When will my hands be clean of you You’re still the ants but I am fireproof I hold my breath, you take a purple hue Until my hands are clean of youAll alone again All alone again I speak as if I've lived One minute With eyes not fixed upon this screen Stalking the girls I could never fuck I mean, they're sluts, but it seems I lack that luck And I'm not the man to wash my hands Home alone or acting like we hit it off'Cause either way I'm just jerking someone off Until we're dicks out and pissing Until you leave town wishing I won't be satisfied Things are gonna be different now you'll see And as for all the dirty laundry you've left me It's getting aired and with heavy rotation You'd better have a damn good explanation You act as though you have lived A life because your tad bit overcooked But I've been burned and burned I think I tried to wake up too fast From what must have been a two year nap Then I hit my head and it was back to bed for a while I woke up twenty-four in Texas Breaking a sweat to expand my Nexus When it occurred to me, maybe I shouldn't be Making excuses to cope so liberally They say some things just don't wash out But I've been dying to know what getting clean is all about And now years have gone by But it's still stuck in my mind For too long now I've sung the same sad song But I didn't even write it; I was just singing along But the problem with change is it's hard Like finding lively conversation in graveyards I hit the nail on the head, drove it straight through my hand I have martyred myself in a scheme not so grand More deserving of men left to rot in a rag Haven't done shit with my life and my skin is starting to sagTonight will be preceded by A few drinks to calm me down To settle my gut, to work up a smile Because your bones are shakin' baby, agitate my nerves I'm feeling reckless And I feel the need to stress this, I'm stepping out And I'll do this 'till I'm somebody else Well tonight, I'll be a classic work like Edgar Allen Poe And I'll die on these streets of Baltimore As a beggar, John, or buyer Look, I'm just trying to score But at least I won't be out alone I'm with my uncle and his mother And the rest of my family's history is with me shouting "H AV E A NO TH ER!"Now I'm taking all the liberties I was too scared to before I've accepted that we're just chemicals Now bend over and touch the floor PL AN A: has got a boyfriend but she melts to my touch PL AN B: has got a crush as much as she's got a lust PL AN C: well, god forgive me, well she just lives to fuck I'll just act like I'm not in controlI was just seventeen in a world getting mean So my mind took a decade long walk Since it's returned, I've grown more than concerned And I think that it's time for a talk Love the lord, trash the planet Yeah, we already know Adopt a poor, foreign child Can't you just let it go Spread like dust in the breeze Population control I'm not saying we're all guilty, but we sure as hell know I'm all fire and brimstone when I write But I won't leave this seat to join the fight So put the nail in the coffin, I'll be resting my head An average male in America, I'd contribute more dead And when they rail against our actions, or lack thereof I'm sure we'll find shame at last inside We didn't even need to read between the lines I'm running on outdated hardware while shopping for phones In an overcrowded everywhere  together we fold Wielding absolute knowledge in the palm of my hand I peruse tits and ass How was this your God's plan I'd say we need to get outside But there's no point for half the country It's all cops and crops, and parking lots Woods turned into housing plots So the green spaces flee while the food deserts creep Outward from the parts of town Where wealthy hide the black and brown I'm all fire and brimstone when I write But I won't leave this seat to join the fightSweat soaks his shirt And he's feeling his blood thin out And the pulse we've built outside this epidermis keeps his charm en route Pedals to the floor Like my hips pressed to yours There's a whisper from your lips "lets go"You don't stand a chance I'm as stealthy as a slow gas leak By the time that you know you'll have succumbed to me I've never seen such a battle to open one door You're batting eyes As he's taking his time As we're playing out the last notes to your culling song Pedals to the floor Like my hips press to yours There's a whisper from your lips "lets go"You don't stand a chance I'm a rush much like passing out'Cause I'm keeping the secrets you'd all die to know But have no shame'Cause these boundaries called waistlines are bound to be broken sometimeDoes your family have any history Of addiction or succumbing to guys like me Was your father the type to say things right Or was your mother the type to spend the night 'Cause I get the feeling that you're buying time Ironically enough, as you spark that light You order two more shots, but don't wait for the lime Down go your last two reasons to lie Does your conscience keep you up at night screaming out WE K NO W W E K NO WW E K NO W W E K NO WDoes your conscience keep you up at night screaming out WE K NO W W E K NO WW E K NO W W E K NO WCan you feel their stares Cross your fingers And hope he doesn't wait up for you'Cause my touch lingers It will be written all over you Cross your fingers And hope he buys all the shit you feed him'Cause that taste lingers When he's gone and you still need himI look around I feel like all our time is running down Everything's paved And not even room left for this poor man's grave Strip every mine Depleting resources like it's our nation's pride Everything's corn We're all gonna starve someday 'cause we're all so sure Then again, the earth's been flat before I've made a big mistake and I'll be paying for it I've made a big mistake We're never gonna learn I've made a big mistake and I'll be paying for it'Til they're pushing earth back just for me Eat wild cotton free To do so we let steel monsters vacuum the seeds But hand me a plate I'll fill my gut 'til my knees can't stand the weight Land of the free where debt is driving force of this economy The home of the brave Our motto is "Drone strike any brown man that can shave"Weeds are getting stronger And we don't live that much longer But they just put a T V the size of moon out They it 3 D now so we can fully tune out
