Whirlwind Take me there Where I will be His lady fair Sheets of night Hiding us Gusts of wind Riding us I'm blown away Into his hands I'm weak and high Can barely stand In the web Of dizzy leaves Virgins all Elude the trees Touch me now Touch me The black acres are claiming me They're claiming me He holds me up Like a babe Pressing close I can't behave I need to have This little death I'm up against His downy chestIt's been seven years now Living in this box Closed in on all sides No light, just dark He kept me under the bed I'd pray for it to stop He'd lock me safely away And lie on top Pop the latches open the hatches Out comes Jack in the box Doing tricks and taking licks Out comes Jack in the box I was an uncut marionette Hanging by steel cable threads I was a shadow dancer A thousand shades of red There's too much light it's far too bright I see things much too clearly There's too much light it's far too bright Weary, oh so weary Pop the latches open the hatches Out comes Jack in the box Doing tricks and taking licks Out comes Jack in the boxTrap her in the woods see her hood flashing red through the pines Briars in her hair, bloody lip, where I'll sip, lapping red just like wine Granny's got a plan take my hand little girl, darling child Let me keep you warm, wrap you up from the wet and the wild My what big eyes you have My what big hands you have My what hot breath you have My what sharp teeth you have Nana how you've changed I feel strange, pardon me I'm a mess Can you give a hand helping me from the binds of this dress Look at me I'm torn, all the rips, guess I slipped caught a fright in the woods Nana you look funny, tell me dear, are you not feeling good My what big eyes you have My what big hands you have My what hot breath you have My what sharp teeth you have My what big eyes you have My what big hands you have My what hot breath you haveTake this kiss upon the brow And in parting from you now Thus much let me avow You are not wrong My days have been a dream Yet if hope has flown away In a night or in a day In a vision or in none Is it therefore the less gone All that we see All that we seem Is but a dream within a dream Dream I stand amid the roar Of a surf tormented shore And I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand Oh how they creep From my fingers to the deep While I weep while I weep Oh God can I not grasp With a tighter clasp Oh God can I not save One from the pitiless waveLet me bend your mind Just give up your body If you give it a try I know you won't be sorry Filling inside turn you outside Find you shining Spanning acres crashing breakers Can be blinding Ride Sweet smelling ride Your shoulder blades like sails And your mouth my rosary That terrifies my tail The feral dance of infinity Limbs are singing velvet stinging Seashell pining Dripping sapling nature grappling Tear the binding Wide Spread so wide I wanna hear you sigh Just give me your body I want to see it in the light Surrender to debaucheryWhen I am drifting in my dream I love you When I wake and nothing's what it seemed I love you When the final midnight's poised to stroke I love you And all of the looking glasses broke When all of the aces have been drawn I love you When your king is cornered by my pawn I love you When you are asleep and so defenceless I love you When this wicked world has turned against us Even though we didn't kiss goodbye I love you When there are no tears in me to cry I love you When the willow's weeping with desire When the furthest cold and distant planet catches fire Fire Tear at the sky, haunted by windows Those are the eyes Always searching never seeing souls are sailing slowly LonelyWhirlwind Take me there Where I will be His lady fair Sheets of night Hiding us Gusts of wind Riding
