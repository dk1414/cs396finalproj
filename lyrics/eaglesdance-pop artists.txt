On a dark desert highway Cool wind in my hair Warm smell of colitas Rising up through the air Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night There she stood in the doorway I heard the mission bell And I was thinkin' to myself"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"Then she lit up a candle And she showed me the way There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say"Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place Such a lovely face Plenty of room at the Hotel California Any time of year You can find it here"Well, I'm running down the road tryin' to loosen my load I've got seven women on my mind Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me One says she's a friend of mine Take It easy, take it easy Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy Lighten up while you still can Don't even try to understand Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy Well, I'm a standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona And such a fine sight to see It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford Slowin' down to take a look at me Come on, baby, don't say maybe I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me We may lose, and we may win Though we will never be here again So open up, I'm climbin' in So take it easyDesperado, why don't you come to your senses You've been out ridin' fences for so long now Oh, you're a hard one, but I know that you got your reasons These things that are pleasin' you can hurt you somehow Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy She'll beat you if she's able You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet Now it seems to me some fine things Have been laid upon your table But you only want the ones that you can't get Desperado, woah, you ain't gettin' no younger Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home And freedom, oh, freedom, well, that's just some people talkin'Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine It's hard to tell the nighttime from the day You're losin' all your highs and lows Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes Away One of these nights One of these crazy old nights We're gonna find out, pretty mama What turns on your lights The full moon is calling, the fever is high And the wicked wind whispers and moans You got your demons and you got desires Well, I got a few of my own Ooh, someone to be kind to In between the dark and the light Ooh, coming right behind you Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights One of these dreams One of these lost and lonely dreams, now We're gonna find one Mmm, one that really screams I've been searching for the daughter of the devil himself I've been searching for an angel in white I've been waiting for a woman who's a little of both And I can feel her, but she's nowhere in sightHe was a hard-headed man, he was brutally handsome And she was terminally pretty She held him up and he held her for ransom In the heart of the cold, cold city He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude They said he was ruthless, they said he was crude They had one thing in common, they were good in bed She'd say, "Faster, faster, the lights are turnin' red"Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind Life in the fast lane, huh Are you with me so far Eager for action, hot for the game The coming attraction, the drop of a name They knew all the right people, they took all the right pills They threw outrageous parties, they paid heavenly bills There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face She pretended not to notice, she was caught up in the race Out every evening, until it was light He was too tired to make it, she was too tired to fight about itAll alone at the end of the evening When the bright lights have faded to blue I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have Loved me and I never knew You know I've always been a dreamer And it's so hard to change But the dreams I've seen lately Keep on turning out and burning out And turning out the same So put me on a highway And show me a sign And take it to the limit one more time You can spend all your time making money You can spend all your love making time If it all fell to pieces tomorrow Would you still be mine And when you're looking for your freedom And you can't find the door When there's nothing to believe in Still you're coming back, you're running back You're coming back for moreShe came from Providence One in Rhode Island Where the old world shadows hang Heavy in the air She packed her hopes and dreams Like a refugee Just as her father came Across the sea She heard about a place People were smiling They spoke about the red man's ways And how they loved the land And they came from everywhere To the Great Divide Seeking a place to stand Or a place to hide Down in the crowded bars Out for a good time Can't wait to tell you all What it's like up there And they called it paradise I don't know why Somebody laid the mountains low While the town got highIt's another tequila sunrise Starin' slowly 'cross the sky I said goodbye He was just a hired hand Workin' on the dreams he planned to try The days go by Every night when the sun goes down Just another lonely boy in town And she's out runnin' 'round She wasn't just another woman And I couldn't keep from comin' on It's been so long Woah, and it's a hollow feelin'When it comes down to dealin' friends It never endsâ€‹Take another shot of courage Wonder why the right words never come You just get numb It's another tequila sunrise This old world still looks the same Another frameOn a dark desert highway Cool wind in my hair Warm smell of colitas Rising up through the air Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light
