Sleepin' on Meserole Ave out in the rain Without even a single slice of pizza to my name Too proud to beg for change, mastering the pain When New York niggas was calling southern rappers lame But then jacking our slang I used to get dizzy spells, hear a little ring The voice of an angel telling me my name Telling me that one day I'ma be a great mane Transforming with the Megatron Don, spittin' out flames Eating wack rappers alive, shittin' out chains I ain't believe it then; nigga, I was homeless Fightin', shootin' dice, smokin' weed on the corners Trying to find the meaning of life in a Corona'Til the Five Percenters rolled up on a nigga and informed him:"You either build or destroy, where you come from ""The Magnolia projects in the 3rd Ward slum""Hmm, it's quite amazing that you rhyme how you do And that you shine like you grew up in a shrine in Peru" Question Fourteen, Muslim Lesson Two:Dip-dive-uh, civilize a eighty-five-uh I make the devil hit his knees and say the "Our

like Jews and Christians I was on Cecil B., Broad Street, Master North Philly, South Philly, 23rd, Tasker Six Mile, Seven Mile, Hartwell, Gratiot Where niggas really would pack a U-Haul truck up Put the high beams on, drive up on the curb At a barbecue and hop up out the back like, "What's up " Kill a nigga, rob a nigga, take a nigga, bust up That's why when you talk the tough talk, I never feel

ghost of him From the era of police stretcher, no cameras catch it Drop you off in a rival hood, you rather be arrested If you didn't have no straps, you couldn't wear your necklace Niggas hand around your throat, that's a choker reference My ancestors took old food, made soul food Jim Crow's a troll too, he stole the soul music That's the blood that goes through me, so you assumin'I could never sell my soul, they sold they soul to me Peaceful teaching of Rumi, but don't confuse me You mouth off for the cameras, I make a silent movie Now here's some jewelry No civilization is conquered from

yeah I'm sailing on a cloud, they trailing below My shrink told me, "It's a feeling they'll never know"I pack up all my sins and I wear 'em to the show And let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go I'm sailing on a cloud, they trailing below My shrink told me, "It's a feeling they'll never know"I pack up all my sins in every L that I blow And let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go In the land before time A land before altar boys, synagogues, and shrines, man was in his prime Look how far I go in time just to start a rhyme The method is sublime, you get blessed with every line I'm in touch with every shrine from Japan to Oaxaca The melanated carbon-dated phantom of the chakras Me and Puff, we was chilling in Miami He said, "Nigga, fuck the underground, you need to win a Grammy For your mama and your family, they need to see you shined up You built a mighty high ladder, let me see you climb up Nigga, what you scared of Terrorize these artificial rap niggas and spread love, pollinate they earbuds Like you supposed to, spit it for the culture Pay no attention to the critics and the vultures They rather have a shot of Belvy just to spite you They casting judgments 'cause they feel they got the right to Fuck 'em, I let the dice roll like The Father did I gotta shine, it's in my blood, I'm a Harlem kid I treat my babies right, treat my ladies ladylike Hit them with a remix to make sure that they play me twice I thought you said, "It's the return of the black kings Luxurious homes, fur coats, and fat chains"If one would open up truth, such as the truth of God to the people, I do think that He's within his rights to stay out of the sight of the people until He has won everything to Himself; as the Bible refers to it like this: He's something like a king looking for a kingdom  And that He goes and he visits the people, then He leaves the people, goes away and waits until the time when that He can secure the kingdom  Then He returns to the people that He had made Himself manifest to  So I think that's a pretty good answer Well, I can't do anything without consulting my crystal first  Let's go inside here, just come along, I'll show you, that's right, here  Sit down right here, that's it  This, this is the same genuine, magic, authentic crystal used by the priest of Isis and Osiris in the days of the pharaohs of Egypt  In which, Cleopatra first saw the approach of Julius Caesar and Mark Antony and so on and so on  Now you better close your eyes, my child, for a moment, in order to be better in tune with the infinite It's frustratin' when you just can't express yourself And it's hard to trust enough to undress yourself To stand exposed and naked, in a world full of hatred Where the sick thoughts of mankind control all the sacred I pause, take a step back, record all the setbacks Fast forward towards the stars and the jetpack My feet might fail me, my heart might ail me The synagogues of Satan might accuse or jail me Strip, crown, nail me, brimstone hail me They might defeat the flesh but they could never ever kill me They might can feel the music but could never ever feel me To the lawyers, to the sheriffs, to the judges To the debt holders and the law makers Fuck you, sue me, bill me That name on that birth certificate, that ain't the real me The lies can't conceal me The sun rise and the moon tides and the sky's gon' reveal me My brain pours water out my tear ducts to heal me My Lord's too beneficent The message grab a hold to every ear it get whispered in The waters in the bayous of New Orleans still glistenin'The universe is listenin', be careful what you say in it My grandma told me every bed a nigga make, he lay in it The church you go to pray in it, the work is on the outside Staring out the windows is for love songs and house fliesThe boy raps over movie scores  His last rap was over the movie score for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind She say she never fell in love with a Superman Christian, Muslim, Protestant, Lutheran I told her that being a mortal is the portal To the true nature of growth; the Christlike Buddha man That's why I never spit the traditional garbage of a knife fight Bright lights, white ice to the fans The radio is just a stereo, like a house ain't a home And a chair is just a chair, ask Luther Van Go to work; go to church let your dreams die Bow tie, Final Call, and a bean pie Yarmulke for Hanukkah, wish list for Christmas This is the gist of the life that we lead, why So you can fit in, with the closed-minded in the sit-ins And get clothes-lined in the ed-end I could care less about a plaque and Bid-enz And gettin' Punked on T V by my fri-dends Don't get a nigga wrong I get tempted by the rewards that all come along with making nigga songs But what does it mean if I'm a Muslim and you a Jew And because of that alone we don't get along And when you talk like this, and try to walk like this The radio stations'll never put a nigga on Just Mims, just 50, just Wayne, just Jeezy Dem Franchize Boyz, and Jimmy Jones Fuck that, fuck rap, this 'god-hop'Kingdom music for the hard rocks I'mma spit it 'til T RL get it and Hot 97 hit a nigga with a bomb drop Ask Flex, ask Slay, ask Whoo Kid Just Blaze said Jay is the new kid I took Eternal Sunshine and I looped it No drums no hook just new shit Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless MindHave you ever heard the tale of The noblest of gentlemen who rose up from squalor Tall, dark, and decked out in customary regalia Smellin' like paraphernalia Hailin' from the home of Mahalia His uptown smile was gold like a Frankie Beverly day His favorite song from Prince was not "Raspberry Beret"It was "Sometimes It Snows In April"He was brought up by the faithful In the cage of every unclean bird, ungrateful and hateful The legend of the clandestine reverend from the Bricks With the master's grip to pull the sleeping giant out the ditch And I ain't even have to wiggle my nose like Bewitched I just up-shift to six, convert the V4 to a broomstick Though I tarry through the valley of death, my Lord give me pasture If you want to be a master in life, you must submit to a master I was born to lock horns with the Devil at the brink of the hereafter Me, the socket, the plug, and universal adapter The prodigal son who went from his own vomit To the top of the mountain with five pillars and a sonnet The autobiography read Quranic Spread love like Kermit the Frog, that permeate the fog I'm at war like the Dukes of Hazzard against the Bosses of the Hogs Gip-Gip-Giggity, Alchemist put the icing on the soliloquy Let it be forever known that I niced up to pen something considerably Jay Electollah Flomeini mainly is support mainly The fatwa he issued on al-Shayṭān was delivered plainly It's the day of Qiyāmah To the believers, I bring you tidings of joy But if you want beef, I'll filet mignon ya You could catch me bummy as fuck or decked out in designer On I-10 West to the desert, on a Diavel like a recliner Listen to everything from a lecture From the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan To Serge Gainsbourg or Madonna or a podcast on piranhas What a time we livin' in, just like the scripture says Earthquakes, fires, and plagues, the resurrection of the dead
