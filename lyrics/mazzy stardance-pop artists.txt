I wanna hold the hand inside you I wanna take the breath that's true I look to you and I see nothing I look to you to see the truth You live your life, you go in shadows You'll come apart and you'll go blind Some kind of night into your darkness Colored your eyes with what's not there Fade into you Strange you never knew Fade into you I think it's strange you never knew A stranger's light comes on slowly A stranger's heart without a home You put your hands into your head And then its smiles cover your heart Fade into you Strange you never knew Fade into you I think it's strange you never knew Fade into you Strange you never knew Fade into you I think it's strange you never knew I think it's strange you never knewStill falling, breathless and on again Inside today, beside me today Around, broken in two Till your eyes shed into dust Like two strangers turning into dust Till my hand shook with the weight of fear I could possibly be fading Or have something more to gain I could feel myself growing colder I could feel myself under your fate Under your fate It was you, breathless and torn I could feel my eyes turning into dust And two strangers turning into dust Turning into dustLook on down from the bridge There's still fountains down there Look on down from the bridge It's still raining, up here Everybody seems so far away from me Everybody just wants to be free Look away from the sky It's no different when you're leaving home I can't be the same thing to you now I'm just gone, just gone How could I say goodbye How could I say goodbye Goodbye Maybe I'll just place my hands over you And close my eyes real tight There's a light in your eyes And you know, yeah, you know Look on down from the bridge I'm still waiting for youBefore I let you down again I just want to see you in your eyes I would have taken everything out on you I only thought you could understand They say every man goes blind in his heart And they say everybody steals somebody's heart away And I've got nothing more to say about it Nothing more than you would me Send me your flowers of your December Send me your dreams of your candy wine I got just one thing I can't give you Just one more thing of mine They say every man goes blind in his heart They say everybody steals somebody's heart away And I've been wondering why you let me down And I've been taking it all for grantedThere's a blue light In my best friend's room There's a blue light In his eye There's a blue light, yeah I wanna see it Shine There's a ship that sails by my window There's a ship that sails on by There's a world under it I think I see it sailing away I think it's sailing Miles crashing me by Crashing me by Crashing me by There's a world outside my doorstep Flames over, everyone's hot Don't you see them shining I want to hear them beating for me I think I hear themWell I think I see another side Maybe just another light that shines And I look over now through the door And I still belong to no one else Maybe I hold you to blame for all the reasons That you left And close my eyes, still I see your surprise And you're leaving before my time Baby won't you change your mind Surely don't stay long I'm missing you now It's like I told you I'm over you somehow Before I close the door I Need to hear you say goodbye Baby won't you change your mind I guess that hasn't changed someone Maybe nobody else could understand I guess that you believe you are a woman And that I am someone else's man But just before I see that you leave I want you to hold on to things that you said Baby I wish I was dead Surely don't stay long I'm missing you now It's like I told you I'm over you somehow Before I close the door I Need to hear you say goodbye Baby won't you change your mind This is my five string serenade Beneath the water we play And while I'm playing for you It could be raining there too This is my five string serenade Beneath the water we play And while I'm playing for you It could be raining there too And on my easel I drew While I was thinking of you And on the roof of my head In came my five string serenade This is my five string serenade Beneath the water we play And while I'm playing for you It might be raining there too And on my easel I drew While I was thinking of you And on the roof of my head In came my five string serenadeWell you're still walking Around the block You had a long time To think who you are You look so sad Well so you think You say "come over"And you're still a star You're like a villain In some old film Walking in the dark In somebody's room Save me'Cause I'm still sinking And you've got a harbor Close to the shore Simple Your thoughts are swimming I'd like to see them When you're alone You've got the same smile You had before It's just lighter And what I adoreCome up, crash with the muses, fells dust and ash Come so close that I might see the light inside that you didn't see Let me hold you tight in hands, tight and long, you lost your chance Come so close that I might see the crashing lights come down on me With one look I find the dark Stop me now, find me to your heart Let me hold you tight like rain, sunshine on a rainy day Come so close that I might see, see the light come down on me Searching like the crash goes by, small like wind and refuse to die Free me now so I can see, the taste of wind and be like me Taste the wind and be like me Taste the wind and be like me With one look I find the dark Stop me now, find me to your heart Let me hold you tight like rain, sunshine on a rainy day Let me hold you tight in hands, tight and long, you lost your chance Come so close that I might see, the crash of light come down on me The crash of lights coming down on me The crash of lights coming down on me Let me hold you tight in hands, tight and long, you lost your chance Come so close that I might see, the crashing light come down on me With one look I find the dark Stop me now, find me to your heart So tonight the crash goes by, small like wind and fears to die Come so close that I might see, see the light come down on me And I hold you tight like rain Sunshine on a rainy day Sunshine on a rainy day Sunshine on a rainy dayEveryday you can see Changes in her hair and smile I can wait a million days While her smile goes away Sometimes I feel deceived By the slices in her hand Secrets in her lipstick mouth Shine me on never again Shine me on never again Capture a smile and then that's all You won't know her so it's okay Funny how things change Funny how things change
