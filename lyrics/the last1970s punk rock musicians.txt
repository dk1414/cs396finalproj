used to tell me stories about the old days, a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, and Air Nomads  But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked  Only the Avatar mastered all four elements  Only he could stop the ruthless firebenders, but when the world needed him most, he vanished  A hundred years have passed and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the War.Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe

has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone  But I believe Aang can save the world I just sort of always feel sick without you, baby I ain't got anything to lick without you, baby Nothing seems to stick without you, baby Ain't I fallen in love It's just the pits without you, baby It's really just the pits without you, baby It's like everyone's a dick without you, baby Ain't I fallen in love And all my pals will tell me is that I'm crazy You bet I'm loopy, alright And I just don't recognise this fool that you have made me Woah, I ain't seen him for a while And as your shrinking figure blows a kiss I catch and smash it on my lips Darling, I can't seem to quit Completely falling to bits I really might be losing it The idea that you've existed all along's ridiculous I don't
