Now The mist across the window hides the lines But nothing hides the color of the lights that shine Electricity so fine Look and dry your eyes We So tired of all the darkness in our lives With no more angry words to say can come alive Get into a car and drive To the other side Me babe, steppin' out Into the night Into the light You babe, steppin' out Into the night Into the light We Are young but getting old before our time We'll leave the T.V  and the radio behind Don't you wonder what we'll find Steppin' out tonight Take your mind back, I don't know when Some time when it always seemed to be just us and them Girls that wore pink and boys that wore blue Boys that always grew up better men than me and you What's a man now  What's a man mean Is he rough or is he rugged Is he cultural and clean Now it's all changed, it's got to change more'Cause we think it's getting better But nobody's really sure And so it goes, go 'round again But now and then we wonder who the real men are See the nice boys, dancing in pairs Golden earring, golden tan, blow wave in their hair Sure, they're all straight, straight as a line All the gays are macho Can't you see the leather shine You don't want to sound dumb, don't want to offend So don't call me a faggot Not unless you are a friend Then if you're tall and handsome and strong You can wear the uniform and I could play alongPretty women out walking with gorillas down my street From my window, I'm staring while my coffee goes cold Look over there There, there's a lady that I used to know She's married now or engaged or something, so I'm told Is she really going out with him Is she really gonna take him home tonight Is she really going out with him 'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me There's something going wrong around here Tonight's the night when I go to all the parties down my street I wash my hair and I kid myself I look real smooth Look over there There, here comes Jeanie with her new boyfriend They say that looks don't count for much If so, there goes your proof Is she really going out with him Is she really gonna take him home tonight Is she really going out with him 'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me There's something going wrong around here Around hereWhat the hell is wrong with you tonight I can't seem to say or do the right thing Wanted to be sure you're feeling right Wanted to be sure we want the same thing She said, "I can't believe it You can't possibly mean it Don't we all want the same thing Don't we Well, who said anything about love ""No, not love", she said"Don't you know that it's different for girls ""No, not love", she said"Don't you know that it's different for girls You're all the same"Mama always told me, "Save yourself Take a little time and find the right girl Then again, don't end up on the shelf"Logical advice gets you in a whirlPretty soon now, you know I'm gonna make a comeback And like the birds and the bees in the trees, it's a sure-fire smash I'll speak to the masses through the media And if you got anything to say to me, you can say it with cash'Cause I've got the trash and you got the cash So baby, we should get along fine So give me all your money 'cause I know you think I'm funny, yeah Can't you hear me laughing  Can't you see me smile I'm the man I'm the man that gave you the hula hoop I'm the man I'm the man that gave you the yo-yo Kung fu, well, that was one of my good ones Well, what's a few broken bones when we all know it's good clean fun Skateboards, I've almost made them respectable You see, I can't always get through to you, so I go for your son I had a giant rubber shark and it really made a mark Did you look-a, look-a, lookit all the blood So give me all your money 'cause I know you think I'm funny, yeah Can't you hear me laughing  Can't you see me smile Won't you be my number two Me and number one are through There won't be too much to do Just smile when I feel blue And there's not much left of me What you get is what you see Is it worth the energy I'll leave it up to you And if you got something to say to me Don't try to lay your funny ways on me I know that it's really not fair of me But my heart's seen too much action And every time I look at you You'll be who I want you to And I'll do what I can do To make a dream or two come true If you'll be my number two And if you got something to say to me Don't try to lay your funny ways on me I know that it's really not fair of me But my heart's seen too much actionDon't you feel like trying something new Don't you feel like breaking out or breaking us in two You don't do the things that I do You want to do things I can't do Always something breaking us in two You and I could never live alone But don't you feel like breaking out just one day on your own Why does what I'm saying hurt you I didn't say that we were through Always something breaking us in two They say two hearts should beat as one for us We'll fight it out to see it through I say that won't be too much fun for us Though it's oh so nice to get advice It's oh so hard to do Could we be much closer if we tried We could stay at home and stare into each other's eyes Maybe we could last an hour Maybe then we'd see right through Always something breaking us in twoWake up, got another day to get through now Got another man to see Got to call him on the telephone Hey-oh, got to find a piece of paper Sit down, got another letter to write Think hard, got to get a letter just right Hear a ringing on the telephone Oh no, got to write a little later No such thing as tomorrow, only one, two, three, go Time, got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head Time, got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head Time, got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head Tickin' in my head Tickin' in my head Tickin' in my head If I tell you what I'm doing today Will you shut up and get out of my way Someone asked me what the time is, I don't know Only know I gotta go now No time, trying to get a watch repaired No time, never got a thing to wear Hear the ringin' of the telephone, no, no Hear a ringin' in my head nowDave lives in a cave under a hill A little way from the sea Two cups of tea And rashers for breakfast, well done Works until one, no need to run Just what he needs to live Head like a sieve Still you can't call him a slave And you and me just keep on Rushing round the world To chase the perfect crime Could it be that while we’re Rushing round the world We're wasting all our time Dave watches the waves They come and go, so he don't have to Why reach for the sky He got a job once in Spain, away from the rain Got on a train Turned around, came right back, on the same track Why doesn’t he just behaveNow The mist across the window hides the lines But nothing hides the color of the lights that shine Electricity so fine Look and dry your eyes We So tired of all the darkness in our lives With no more angry words to say can come alive Get into a car and drive To the other side Me babe, steppin' out Into the night Into the light You babe, steppin' out Into the night Into the light We Are young but getting old before our time We'll leave the T.V  and the radio behind Don't you wonder what we'll find Steppin' out tonight
