And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack And you may find yourself in another part of the world And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife And you may ask yourself, “Well, how did I get here ”Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down Letting the days go by, water flowing underground Into the blue again after the money's gone Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground And you may ask yourself, “How do I work this ”And you may ask yourself, “Where is that large automobile ”And you may tell yourself, “This is not my beautiful house”And you may tell yourself, “This is not my beautiful wife”Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down Letting the days go by, water flowing underground Into the blue again after the money's gone Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Same as it ever was, same as it ever wasI can't seem to face up to the facts I'm tense and nervous, and I can't relax I can't sleep cause my bed's on fire Don't touch me, I'm a real live wire Psycho killer, qu'est-ce que c'est Fa-fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa, fa, better Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away Oh, oh Psycho killer, qu'est-ce que c'est Fa-fa-fa-fa,

anything When I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed Say something once, why say it again Psycho killer, qu'est-ce que c'est Fa-fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa, fa, better Run, run, run, run, run, run,

and turn me around I feel numb, born with a weak heart I guess I must be having fun The less we say about it, the better We'll make it up as we go along Feet on the ground, head in the sky It's okay, I know nothing's wrong, nothing Hi-yeah, I got plenty of time Hi-yeah, you got light in your eyes And you're standing here beside me I love the passing of time Never for money, always for love Cover up and say goodnight, say goodnight Home is where I want to be But I guess I'm already there I come home, she lifted up her wings I guess that this must be the place I can't tell one from another Did I find you or you find me There was a time before we were born If someone asks, this is where I'll be, where I'll beAh Watch out, you might get what you're after Cool, babies – strange but not a stranger I'm an ordinary guy Burning down the house Hold tight, wait till the party's over Hold tight, we're in for nasty weather There has got to be a way Burning down the house Here's your ticket, pack your bag, it's time for jumping overboard The transportation is here Close enough but not too far, maybe you know where you are Fighting fire with fire, ah!All wet, here, you might need a raincoat Shake-down, dreams walking in broad daylight Three hundred sixty-five degrees Burning down the house It was once upon a place, sometimes I listen to myself Gonna come in first place People on their way to work say, “Baby, what did you expect ”Gonna burst into flame, ahTake a look at these hands Take a look at these hands The hand speaks The hand of a government man Well, I'm a tumbler Born under punches I'm so thin All I want is to breathe Won't you breathe with me Find a little space so we move in-between And keep one step ahead of yourself Don't you miss it  Don't you miss it Some 'a you people just about missed it Last time to make plans, well, I'm a tumbler I'm a government man Never seen anything like that before Falling bodies tumble 'cross the floor When you get to where you wanna be When you get to where you wanna be Heard of a van that is loaded with weapons Packed up and ready to go Heard of some gravesites out by the highway A place where nobody knows The sound of gunfire off in the distance I'm getting used to it now Lived in a brownstone, lived in the ghetto I've lived all over this town This ain't no party, this ain't no disco This ain't no fooling around No time for dancing, or lovey-dovey I ain't got time for that now Transmit the message, to the receiver Hope for an answer some day I got three passports, a couple of visas You don't even know my real name High on a hillside, the trucks are loading Everything's ready to roll I sleep in the daytime and I work in the nighttime I might not ever get homeLost my shape, trying to act casual Can't stop, I might end up in the hospital Changing my shape, I feel like an accident They're back to explain their experience Isn't it weird  Looks too obscure to me Wasting away, that was their policy I'm ready to leave, I push the facts in front of me Facts lost, facts are never what they seem to be Nothing there, no information left of any kind Li-lifting my head, lo-lo-looking for the danger signs There was a line, there was a formula Sharp as a knife, facts cut a hole in us There was a line, there was a formula Sharp as a knife, facts cut a hole in us I'm still waiting I-I-I'm still waiting I'm still waiting I-I-I'm still waiting I'm still waiting I-I-I'm still waiting I'm still waiting I-I-I'm still waitingI, who took the money Who took the money away I, I, I, I, it's always showtime Here at the edge of the stage I, I, I, wake up and wonder What was the place, what was the name We wanna wait, but here we go again I, takes over slowly But doesn't last very long I, I, I, I, no need to worry Everything's under control O-U-T, but no hard feelings What do you know  Take you away We're being taken for a ride again I got a girlfriend that's better than that She has the smoke in her eyes She's coming up, going right through my heart She's gonna give me surprise I think it's right, better than this I think you can if you like I got a girlfriend with bows in her hair And nothing is better than that What about the time you were rollin' over Fall on your face, you must be having fun Walk lightly, think of a time You'd best believe this thing is real Put away that gun, this part is simple Try to recognize what is in your mind God help us, help us to surmise These slippery people help us understand What's the matter with him  I see his face Don't play no games Look from the bottom to the top Turn like a wheel See for yourself We're gonna move Turn like a wheel inside a wheel I remember when sittin' in the tub Pulled out the plug, the water was runnin' out Cool down, stop actin' crazy They're gonna leave and we'll be on our own Seven times five, they were living creatures Watch 'em come to life right before your eyes Backsliding, how do you do These slippery people gonna see you throughSometimes the world has a load of questions Seems like the world knows nothing at all The world is near, but it's out of reach Some people touch it, but they can't hold on She is moving to describe the world She has messages for everyone She is moving by remote control Hands that guide her are invisible The world has a way of looking at people Sometimes we feel that the world is wrong She loves the world and all the people in it She shakes 'em up when she start to walk
