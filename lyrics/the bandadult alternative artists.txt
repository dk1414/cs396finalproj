I pulled in to Nazareth Was feeling 'bout half past dead I just need some place Where I can lay my head"Hey, mister, can you tell me Where a man might find a bed "He just grinned and shook my hand And "No" was all he said Take a load off Fanny Take a load for free Take a load off Fanny And  you put the load right on me I picked up my bag I went looking for a place to hide When I saw Carmen and the Devil Walking side by side I said "Hey Carmen, come on Let's go downtown "And she said, "I gotta go But my friend can stick around"If I die young, bury me in satin Lay me down on a bed of roses Sink me in the river at dawn Send me away with the words of a love song Oh-oh, oh-oh Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby The sharp knife of a short life Well, I've had just enough time If I die young, bury me in satin Lay me down on a bed of roses Sink me in the river at dawn Send me away with the words of a love song The sharp knife of a short life Well, I've had just enough time And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger I've never known the lovin' of man But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me

tracks again In the winter of '65, we were hungry, just barely alive By May the tenth, Richmond had fell It's a time I remember, oh so well:The night they drove old Dixie down And the bells were ringing The night they drove old Dixie down And the people were singing They went, "La, la, la":Back with my wife in Tennessee When one day she called to me"Virgil, quick, come see, there goes Robert E.Lee"Now I don't mind choppin' wood And I don't care if the money's no good Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest But they should never have taken the very best The night they drove old Dixie down And the bells were ringing The night they drove old Dixie down And the people were singing They went, "La, la, la"Thirty miles on the Gulf Stream I hear the south wind moan The bridges getting lower The shrimp boats coming home The old man down in the Quarter Slowly turns his head Takes a sip from his whiskey bottle And this is what he said I was born in the rain On the Pontchartrain Underneath the Louisiana moon I don't mind the strain Of a hurricane They come around every June The high black water A devil's daughter She's hard, she's cold, and she's mean But nobody taught her It takes a lot of water To wash away New Orleans Man came down from Chicago He gonna set that levee right He said, "It needs to be at least three feet higher"It won't make it through the night"But the old man down in the Quarter He said "Don't you listen to that boy"The water'll be down by the morning"And he'll be back to Illinois"Give me a second light I haven't smiled since yesterday If I need to I can pay But let me hold this 'til I feel okay Since you burned me at the stake All of my feelings went away There’s no feelings in my way At least there’s no feelings in my way I was there when you were blind to everything that I could see I'll pretend that it's just me But maybe really it's just me I forgot what it was like to think I found you finally What if you were the one for me I hope you weren't the one for me And I know this I can’t read it right, between the fights I still need you And I know this I fell for your eyes, I just realized I still need you I still need youSecond guess these words of mine I always thought that I'd be fine with you But ever since we crossed that line Got your green eyes in the back of my mind, it's true But I can't be just friends You're messin' with my head And I know what I said, but These feelings, they keep runnin' the red I got your heart on my mind and You said that I could come by anytime But I can't, I can't fall in love tonight I can't fall in love tonight I got your face on my mind and It was fun, runnin' around for a while But I can't, I can't fall in love tonight I can't fall in love tonight Two steps forward, one step back It won't be long 'fore my heart's attached And common sense falls second place To the way it feels when you kiss my face You were always searching for deliverance Blatant misconceptions that you make My overall perception of this dream Is that I'll die before I wake At another place in time You were infinitely mine Relatively alright When Berenstein was fine At another place in time Only parallel to mine The universe was alright When Berenstein was fine You were always certain that it did exist Imagination so intrinsic all at stake All the things we said when we were younger Did it bend or did I break At another place in time You were infinitely mine Relatively alright When Berenstein was fine At another place in time Only parallel to mine The universe was alright When Berenstein was fineCall it what you need But don't blame yourself for me Don't blame yourself for me'Cause I spaced myself from you'Cause I got tired of hurting you But now I'm hurting too Call it a rivalry, call it a fight Call it what you want, but I need you tonight Call it a waste of time or call it right But don't call it off, just call the black and white I call it how I see But you care way too much for me And I can't stand that honestly So I pushed it all away'Cause I won't let you see me this way But still, I'd wish you stay Call it a rivalry, call it a fight Call it what you want, but I need you tonight Call it a waste of time or call it right But don't call it off, just call the black and whiteI pulled in to Nazareth Was feeling 'bout half past dead I just need some place Where I can lay my
