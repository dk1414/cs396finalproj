I waited 'til I saw the sun I don't know why I didn't come I left you by the house of fun I don't know why I didn't come I don't know why I didn't come When I saw the break of day I wished that I could fly away Instead of kneeling in the sand Catching teardrops in my hand My heart is drenched in wine But you'll be on my mind forever Out across the endless sea I will die in ecstasy But I'll be a bag of bones Driving down the road alone My heart is drenched in wine But you'll be on my mind foreverCome away with me in the night Come away with me And I will write you a song Come away with me on a bus Come away where they can't tempt us With their lies And I want to walk with you On a cloudy day In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high So won't you try to come Come away with me and we'll kiss On a mountaintop Come away with me And I'll never stop loving you And I want to wake up with the rain Falling on a tin roof While I'm safe there in your arms So all I ask is for you To come away with me in the night Come away with meSunrise, sunrise Looks like mornin' in your eyes But the clock's held 9:15 for hours Sunrise, sunrise Couldn't tempt us if it tried'Cause the afternoon's already come and gone And I said Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh To you Surprise, surprise Couldn't find it in your eyes But I'm sure it's written all over my face Surprise, surprise Never something I could hide When I see we made it through another day And I said Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh To youMean ol’ moon It must be fun To shine upon me As I come undone Til I’m all alone Beneath the sun You mean ol’ moon With your beam You led the way And found me love I thought was Hear to say Then you went and took My love away You mean ol’ moon Oh you mean ol’ stars above The games that you play with me I could find some happiness If all of my nights were cloudy Mean ol’ moon I hope it’s true You’re taking all the light that’s left in you And saving it up for you know who You mean ol’ moonAnd after all's been said and done Who said it best, were you the one Let's just forget, leave it behind And carry on If you should find the time to speak Then speak to me, I'd never keep You from your final destiny So carry on Into the quiet I am bound What you have lost, I've never found I lost my nerve, yet peace surrounds So carry on Into the quiet I am bound What you have lost, I've never found I lost my nerve, yet peace surrounds So carry onLike a flower waiting to bloom Like a lightbulb in a dark room I'm just sitting here waiting for you To come on home and turn me on Like the desert waiting for the rain Like a schoolkid waiting for the spring I'm just sitting here waiting for you To come on home and turn me on And my poor heart, it's been so dark Since you've been gone After all, you're the one who turns me off But you're the only one who can turn me back on My hi-fi is waiting for a new tune My glass is waiting for some fresh ice cubes I'm just sitting here waiting for you To come on home and turn me on Turn me onWhat am I to you Tell me, darlin', true To me, you are the sea Vast as you can be The deepest shade of blue When you're feelin' low To whom else do you go See, I'd cry if you hurt I'd give you my last shirt Because I love you so Now if my sky should fall Would you even call I've opened up my heart I never want to part I'm givin' you the ball When I look in your eyes I can feel the butterflies I will love you when you're blue But tell me, darlin', true What am I to you If my sky should fall Would you even call I've opened up my heart I never wanna part I'm givin' you the ballThere's a place that I know Where the sycamores grow And daffodils have their fun Where the cares of the day Seem to slowly fade away In the glow of the evening sun Peace when the day is done If I go there real late Let my mind meditate On everything to be done If I search deep inside Let my conscience be my guide Then the answers are sure to come Don't have to worry none When you find peace of mind Leave your worries behind Don't say that it can't be done With a new point of view Life's true meaning comes to you And the freedom you seek is won Peace is for everyone Peace is for everyone Peace is for everyoneOoh, ooh Ooh, ooh Into the night, love with me Make me get up off my feet Take the beat out of my heart Now the people might believe And I knew, and I knew And I knew, and I knew it was you And I knew, I knew And I knew, I knew it was you And I knew, and I knew And I knew, I knew it was you And I knew, and I knew And I knew Moments fall like crimson nights Some stick to my skin tonight Take a breath and shake them off Eyes ahead, don't you wait too longTryin' to pick up the pace Tryin' to make it so I never see your face again Time to throw this away Wanna make sure that you never waste my time again How does it feel Oh, how does it feel to be you right now, dear You broke this apart So pick up your piece and go away from here Please just let me go now Please just let me go Would you please just let me go now Please just let me go I'm gonna get you out, I gotta get you out I gotta get you out of my head, get out Gotta get you out, I gotta get you out I gotta get you out of my head, get out Never said we'd be friends Tryin' to keep myself away from you 'cause you're bad, bad news With you gone, I'm alive Makes me feel like I took happy pills and time stands still
