you deserve to know That in this world, you are not beholden You do not owe them Your body and your soul All the youth in the world will not save you from growing older And all the truth in a girl is too precious to be stolen from her It's just the way it is And maybe it's never gonna change But I got a mind to show my strength And I got a right to speak my mind And I'm gonna pay for this They're gonna burn me at the stake But I got a fire in my veins I wasn't made to fall in line No, I wasn't made to fall in line, no Show some skin, make him want you'Cause God forbid you Know your own way home Ask yourself why it matters Who it flatters You're more than flesh and bonesSeems like it was yesterday when I saw your face You told me how proud you were, but I walked away If only I knew what I know today Ooh, ooh I would hold you in my arms I would take the pain away Thank you for all you've done Forgive all your mistakes There's nothing I wouldn't do To hear your voice again Sometimes I wanna call you But I know you won't be there Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you For everything I just couldn't do And I've hurt myself by hurting you Some days I feel broke inside, but I won't admit Sometimes I just wanna hide 'cause it's you I miss And it's so hard to say goodbye when it comes to this Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ahDon't look at me Mm, mm Oh Ooh, oh, mm Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is Oh-ooh, whoa-oh I feel like I've been locked up tight For a century of lonely nights Waiting for someone to release me You're lickin' your lips and blowin' kisses my way But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away Baby, baby, baby Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh If you wanna be with me Baby, there's a price to pay I'm a genie in a bottle You gotta rub me the right way If you wanna be with me I can make your wish come true You gotta make a big impression Gotta like what you doHm After all you put me through You'd think I'd despise you But in the end, I wanna thank you'Cause you made me that much stronger Well, I, I thought I knew you Thinkin' that you were true Guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff Time is up 'cause I've had enough You were there by my side Always down for the ride But your joy ride just came down in flames'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mhm After all of the stealing and cheating You probably think that I hold resentment for you But uh-uh, oh no, you're wrong'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do I wouldn't know just how capable I am to pull through So I wanna say thank you, 'cause itHide it 'til we feel it,
