If I die young, bury me in satin Lay me down on a bed of roses Sink me in the river at dawn Send me away with the words of a love song Oh-oh, oh-oh Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby The sharp knife of a short life Well, I've had just enough time If I die young, bury me in satin Lay me down on a bed of roses Sink me in the river at dawn Send me away with the words of a love song The sharp knife of a short life Well, I've had just enough time And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger I've never known the lovin' of man But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever Who would have thought forever could be severed byI told you on the day we wed I was gonna love you 'til I's dead Made you wait 'til our wedding night That's the first and the last time I wear white So if the ties that bind ever do come loose Tie them in a knot like a hangman's noose'Cause I'll go to heaven or I'll go to hell Before I'll see you with someone else Put me in the ground Put me six foot down And let the stone say:Here lies the girl whose only crutch Was loving one man just a little too much If you go before I do I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two Well It won't be whiskey, it won't be meth It'll be your name on my last breath If divorce or death ever do us part The coroner will call it a broken heartYou've been wearing that crown and tearing me down It's been a while since you've treated me right You strung me along for far too long'Cause I never gave up the fight Until now It's gonna hit you hard 'til you see stars It’s gonna put you through a world of hurt Oh, I don't believe in getting even But giving what you deserve Oh my, oh my, huh Mama always told me that I should play nice She didn't know you when she gave me that advice I'm through with you You're one bridge I'd like to burn Bottle up the ashes, smash the urn I'm through with you, la dee da I don't wanna be your "just for fun"Don't wanna be under your thumb All I wanna be is done DoneHere we are in this moment Eyes closed Where we going Here I am with my arms wide open Go 'head, close the curtains I don't care where we'll end up Right now, let's be in love Here I am with my heart wide open Go 'head, close the curtains Lately, things been getting so crazy I'm feeling like my heart hates me It's blazing I just wanna stay in the dark Turn off all the lights Come hold me tight Where we going I just wanna stay in the dark Turn off all the lights Come hold me tight And get me going I just wanna stay in the darkI'm not gonna be a joke I know about your side piece, bro I’m not gonna fight anymore, yeah Glad I never had your baby This'll be a cleaner cut You can keep the labradors'Cause you wasted my time Been two nights, the last night I’m gonna waste a damn good rhyme on you Have a, have a, have a good life Have a, have a, have a good life You had a, had a, had a good life Have a, have a, have a good life You're never gonna have it good twice Have a, have a, have a good life Sick I ever touched your body Sick you ever tasted mine I should burn the sheets on my bed I don't want an explanation I don't wanna still be friends I just wanna break your neckIt's knowing that your door is always open And your path is free to walk That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag Rolled up and stashed behind your couch And it's knowing I'm not shackled By forgotten words and bonds And the ink stains that are dried upon some line That keeps you on the backroads By the rivers of my memory That keeps you ever gentle on my mind It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy Planted on their columns now that bind me Or something that somebody said Because they thought we fit together walking It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find That you're moving on the backroads By the rivers of my memory And for hours you're just gentle on my mind Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines And the junkyards and the highways come between us And some other woman's cryin' to her mother Cause she turned and I was gone I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads By the rivers flowing gentle on my mindIt ain't complicated Well, I've grown to hate it I never liked the taste of crow But baby, I ate it They tried to warn me They said that you were ornery So don't bring me those big brown eyes And tell me that you're sorry Well, you might as well throw gasoline On a fire The way you lie You lie like a priceless Persian rug On a rich man's floor Well, you lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine On my porch The way you lie like a penny in the parking lot At the grocery store It just comes way too natural to you The way you lieOh ohohoh Oh ohohoh I was dreaming of war; you saw that I wouldn't die Was dreaming of shores that my ship would find I was dreaming because it made me feel so alive Was dreaming it all from my bed last night You will be my only one Hold my hand so we can run You and I, we're staying young, yeah We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever This time, I want it all I want it right now, feel the fall Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever This time, I want it all I want it right now, wanna feel the fall Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy We're gonna live, we're gonna live foreverThey like to kick you when you're down They like it better when you're there on the ground And up 'til now I've never made a sound Hey, hey I bet they've never had a broken heart But they sure know how to beat the hell out of one Sometimes I think they do it just for the fun Hey, hey But no, I'm not leaving, even though I'm bleeding Even though this nightmare makes me wish I was dreaming Even though I hate it, I'm gonna take it Until I win Cause I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback kid Don't know why bad things happened, but they did I don't think I deserve the hurt I get, but I'm made for it It's not the end, no, it's not the end I'm a comeback kid Down for a minute; I'll get up again Looks like I'm breaking, but it's just a bend; it's not over yet Cause in the end I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback kidWe scratched our names In that oak tree'Cause I loved you And you loved me A jagged little heart, so the whole town knew it Carved in the bark with an arrow through it I came out here to see it one more time And I got my chainsaw Oh, you know its gotta go, it's such a shame y'all But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall And I'm sittin' on a stump Love is shady, love is tragic It's hard to bury the hatchet Holdin' a chainsaw Well, I guess all those years They don't mean nothing Now I can't wait To count those rings Nothing left of us but dust and splinters A big pile of wood to keep me warm through the winter Because I, I don't have you
