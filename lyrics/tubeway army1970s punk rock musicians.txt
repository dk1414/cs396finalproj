It's cold outside And the paint's peeling off of my walls There's a man outside In a long coat, grey hat, smoking a cigarette Now the light fades out And I wonder what I'm doing in a room like this There's a knock on the door And just for a second I thought I remembered you So now I'm alone Now I can think for myself About little deals and S.U's And things that I just don't understand Like a white lie at night Or a sly touch at times I don't think it meant anything to you So I open the door It's the 'friend' that I'd left in the hallway"Please sit down."A candlelit shadow on a wall near the bedDown in the park where the machmen Meet the machines and play Kill by Numbers Down in the park with a friend called Five I was in a car crash or was it the war But I've never been quite the same Little white lies like I was there Come to Zom-Zom's, a place to eat Like it was built in one day You can watch the humans trying to run Oh look, there's a rape machine I'd go outside if it'd look the other way You wouldn't believe the things they do Down in the park Where the chant is death, death, death Until sun cries morning Down in the park with friends of mine We are not lovers, we are not romantics We are here to serve you A different face but the words never changeStroll to the cafe My God how time flies I close up my brain And another friend dies I feel like a mirror Feel like nothing is mine I could go back to crying But now dying seems fine So I hang from the ceiling Or I sit on the air Or rot in a corner Until somebody cares Faces at random I quote people I knew I'd love to be like me If I can feel like you Here am I: more roche five than pain Here am I: just me and my walls to blame Here am I, I really don't feel quite sane Here am I: still searching for my shadow in vain Lock my door I only think in black and white I'll even try to look ashamedThe alarm rang for days You could tell from conversations I was waiting by the screen I couldn't recognise my photograph Me, I disconnect from you I was walking up the stairs Something moved in silence I could feel his mind decaying Only inches away from me And I disconnect from you Please don't turn me off I don't know what I'm doing outside Me and the telephone that never rings If you were me, what would you do Me, I disconnect from youIt was hard to avoid I suppose it was the shame But they didn't even try You see we'd never met And they didn't have names There was nothing I could do So I turned on the crowd And I screamed, "You and you""It could have been you"And they seemed to think That I looked that way Or maybe I was wrong So I said"Do you know Mr  Wall "And they looked the other way And then they smiled at me But the police came And I said it was me And I just walked awayMmmmmmm ahhhhhhh Don't be a dummy Move like honey Don't be a dummy Use your money Come out proud, don't hide in the crowd Find the gear of love to grind Find the gear to suit you Mine'll suit ya!Lee Cooper!Lee Cooper I saw him turn on like a machine in the park Saying, "Please come with me", but you've been there before I saw him whir away into the night Like a nightmare on wheels saying, "Never again"I'd give it all up for you I'd even be a number just for you The strangest living boy you could ever wish to see"That's me"Yellowed newspapers tell the story of someone"Do you know this man ", tomorrow the cure Only police ever see night time for real Turn on the light and cry, "No more, no more"I was standing outside your door Waiting for the grey men to go When my mind turned on me with a vengeance I had never known My own Everyone heard the voice on the radio Saying, "Why move around and waste my time "There are no independents anymore The tape is a circle but who really cares I saw you behind the wall I even heard you laugh at me You disgust me tonight with your answer to something new That's youSlowly the thought, "There is no one to replace"Came into view and he began to cry Now only boys that love only boys The perfect picture of a boy/girl age I'm praying to the aliens I'm praying to the aliens Grey overcoat and he could be anyone A random poll check, "Do you ever think of women "They broke him down into a torn old queen Living somewhere between dead and dying Well, I'm praying to the aliens I'm praying to the aliens There are no more, do you begin to see The corner of my eye could give me away Isn't it strange how times change I can't imagine living any other way I'm praying to the aliens I'm praying to the aliens I'm praying to the aliens I'm praying to the aliensWe are so fragile Advertising lies that are whiter than yours We are so fragile They could give us a war just to keep us amused We are so fragile I could stay here inside and say it's all been done We are so fragile Just pretend I never tried, I'll leave it up to you We are still so young And it must be wrong but I'd do it all the same We are really so shy There's nothing I can do except believe in you We could always go home But everyone says this is the place to be We are so unnatural But you wouldn't understand, you only deal with menFade to scenes of violence like a T V screen but silent Where the victims are all paid by the hour Staring at the ceiling as she gyrates all around me I am trying to forget she's done this all before Far too many people for a quiet night with myself Oh, I could be anyone tonight Focus on a feeling I've detected while I'm sleeping Sing a chorus of "On Broadway" and deny it all You are in my vision I can't turn my face You are in my vision I can't move my eyes You are in my vision I can't move at all You are in my vision Delicate bodies that decay beneath their clothing Play cards in an empty house in Paris The wreckage of a hero lies broken in a corner And everyone pretends they like to live that way You are in my vision I can't turn my face You are in my vision I can't move my eyes You are in my vision I can't move at all You are in my vision
