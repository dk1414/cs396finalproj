Her mom found her brother Then she found the container wrapped up in a newspaper Stuffed in a duffel bag with hockey pads And seven grand in rubber bands We didn't speak at the service But then later a message from a number that wasn't familiar said"Hey it's Charlie's sister, would you do me a favor There's unfinished business It's roughly the size of a baseball"I said I wasn't totally sure, but yeah I could probably call someone I knew this kid from my dorm when I went to school in Wisconsin My two semesters were a total disaster and he was part of the problem Hadn't talked in forever But Wayne from Winnetka picked up on the first ring I explained the situation He said he'd be interested, but we'd have to come to him We said lunch time on Wednesday A Mexican restaurant a mile north of Midway He worked for his father's shipping company out west of the city Right now I’m not working She said we could split it Just glad to be finished and not even tempted But it's so goddamn sad in her house right now He’s still here in everything She just needs a break from it Said she wants to come with We left really earlyThere were those same bloodsuckers in the lobby again And when they called out my name I waved I thought they might be my old friends They had the cross in the car They had the pig in the pen I was in the bathroom doing my best to ascend Doubting Thomas had the party supplies He said he likes how it looks When I roll back my eyes The studio sent a car to collect me When the driver dropped me off at the lot He said he'd never forget me The publicist picked up lunch again I had Pabst and some pemmican She said, "Man, you're so damn American,"Doubting Thomas had his eyebrows raised He said he liked me much better When I was walking away No I've never been crucified I've never suffered and died I've never been shot But I've been lied to a lotWell the gangsters drove Preludes And sold this one weed called White Tiger Wirth Park had a body The holiday guy couldn't make change The parking lot scene still existed, but not without problems I came back to St  Paul and things had progressed and got strange I got stuck in a snowbank I was too drunk to drive to Edina Right there is proof of my faith that God watches us And the North Stars went south And my friends all went out to Seattle I stuck around town, hit the bars, then wait for the bus And the guys at Northeast ride bicycles up to the market Fish take to water, but licenses, they get revoked And the writing on walls in the stalls In the bathroom says "Cindy's so easy"But I've never met Cindy, besides it might be a joke Fish take to water but licenses they get revoked I got stuck in a snowbank I was too drunk to drive to Edina Right there is proof of my faith that God watches us And the North Stars went south And my friends all went out to Seattle I stuck around town, hit the bars, then wait for the busHer body was an outpost for ideas that didn’t work A nation failed and broken, invaded and then burnt And the crumbles and the ashes that settled in her purse Were the ruins of an empire and the people we once were We were limping up towards Lake Street and she motioned towards the church Said the hardest thing they ask me is “Amanda, does it hurt ”‘Cause it’s not pain, it's more like pressure on the edges of my eyes I see scales and bloody feathers when I look into the lights And my password is “be honest”And my network is evolved And I can’t guarantee I’ll pick up every time that you call Ain’t it spooky when they all go away Ain’t it strange when they just disappear It really sucks getting sick on the bus It's even worse when the teenagers cheer Ain’t it funny how we all get by But not the way that makes us laugh The lust burns off into handshakes and hugs In the end, it comes down to the cash I was calling from the carpark when they kicked in the door They pulled the pistols from the holsters Put the people on the floor It's not the fear, it's the frustration Getting sick of being scared They pulled your princess to her feet Made a handle from her hairShe said, "Nathan, I need ninety bucks"Puts Popov in a paper cup It’s like she’s trying to burn her insides clean She shimmers like some gasoline All smoke and shaky hands Shuts the shades and hits me with her plan Go back and get certified X-ray tech and M RIs Stick with it and finally see it through I’m sick of all this wilderness The businessmen on business trips The distance goes beyond the rate and time But school don’t start till early fall I went ahead and made a call Sometimes I can push ahead Some nights the wheels just spin Nathan, you’re my only friend Nathan, you’re my only friend Well, Caesar is in a car right now He says isn’t far right now If I’m short when he shows up he’ll be so pissed Because credit is something he don’t do Cash is king and three for two I’ve seen him use his hands to make a fistRight now I feel a bit weightless A little shaky and scared I found a thread in the closet I followed it into darkness James, I'm glad that you're here Tonight I'd like you to dance with me James, I'm glad that you're here I've been estranged from my family I fell asleep by the pool Cigarettes with inches of ashes Premonitions of crashes We jettisoned all the fuel I've been screwing computers James, I'm glad you didn't die It's been loveless and lonely It's been faceless and easy It's been weird, it's been wild Tonight I'd like you to dance with me James, I'm glad that you're here Tonight I'd like you to dance with me We'll be skeletons and ghosts next year When I went to the doctor I didn't feel like talking I just stood by the window Acted like I was crying I just figured that maybe He might let me skate by Right now I feel weightless James, I'm glad you didn't dieThere's a darkness in my body And I think I might be ready Maggie, I've been searching for our son There's a big hole in my thinking Lately I've been seeing things Maggie, I'm still searching for our son If you're down and out If you still have any doubts If you doubt that there's a savior yet to come Stop what you're doing Close your eyes and keep on breathing And still you turn your face up to the sun It was warm in Arizona It was cold in Colorado Maggie, I've been searching for our son There were crosses on the altar There was gold in El Dorado Maggie, I got blisters on my thumbs If you're all strung out If you still have any doubts If you doubt that there's a rapture yet to comeLast night was something I didn't see coming Never made connection like we did in the kitchen Now you're in your uniform looking tired and hostile Two little white ones and a Bud Clamato It's kind of spicy There's mellow music I can tell that today is gonna be a celebration I can tell that today is gonna be a celebration Me and my bicycle with dozens of roses Your manager is pissed Reminds you you're closing I can see you're suspicious You say you barely know me Things were messed up Now everything's perfect It seems a bit quick but I've been praying for this The one thing I've heard about love is it hits when it hits Two little white ones and a Bud Clamato It's kind of spicy There's mellow music I can tell that today is gonna be a celebration I can tell that today is gonna be a celebrationWell the bartender's friend sold us something I think was probably coriander Fourth quarter Hail Mary Wide receiver Hail Caesar The guy we've been waiting for Came up from the catacombs Walked into the bathroom Put it under the trashcan And I went in after Do you even remember They used to call us Junebug and Jester They used to call us Jester and June We used to have our own tune We used to sing it in church And then it got worse We put too much faith Gave too much cash To that one creepy kid at the car wash He said he could make a few calls But I don't think that he made any callsJoanie, I was calling just to tell you that I’m gonna be calling I know you hate to be surprised, I want you to be prepared I guess the doctor’s back in town, I heard they’re gonna give him clearance I see a storm coming up in the distance The only kind of dreams you ever seem to have are bad dreams The only thing you say you ever really want to do is sleep I know that you’ve been passed around You’ve been hurt so much you’re bored I want to give you something to hope for I got a little something from the state for all of my hassle Got little bit more from the guy behind the wheel The captain started laughing then the accident, it happened Now it’s a whole different deal The only kind of dreams you ever seem to have are bad dreams The only thing you ever say you really want to do is smoke I know that you’ve been passed around You’ve been hurt so much that you’re bored I’m going to give you something to hope for
