Do you find it hard to sleep tonight Resting by the Christmas lights Could there be  something you forgot Beyond the bows and mistletoe The tree with presents wrapped below There's more to this than you had ever thought Have we lost the reason that We celebrate each year What is Christmas If there never was a savior Wrapped in a manger What is Christmas without Christ Remember how the story goes God's gift was wrapped in swaddling clothes Beneath the star, one great and holy night The shepherds heard the angels sing The wise man brought an offering Peace on Earth began in BethlehemEverybody falls sometimes Gotta find the strength to rise From the ashes And make a new beginning Anyone can feel the ache You think it's more than you can take But you're stronger Stronger than you know Don't you give up now The sun will soon be shining You gotta face the clouds To find the silver lining I've seen dreams that move the mountains Hope that doesn't ever end Even when the sky is falling I've seen miracles just happen Silent prayers get answered Broken hearts become brand new That's what faith can do It doesn't matter what you've heard Impossible is not a word It's just a reason For someone not to try Everybody's scared to death When they decide to take that step Out on the water But it'll be alrightAll who are thirsty All who are weak Just come to the fountain Dip your heart in the stream of life Let the pain and the sorrow Be washed away In the waves of His mercy As the deep cries out to deep, we sing...Come, Lord Jesus come Come, Lord Jesus come Come, Lord Jesus come Come, Lord Jesus come All who are thirsty All who are weak Just come to the fountain Dip your heart in the stream of life Let the pain and the sorrow Be washed away In the waves of His mercy As the deep cries out to deep, we sing...Come, Lord Jesus come Come, Lord Jesus come Come, Lord Jesus come Come, Lord Jesus comeI have fallen to my knees As I sing a lullaby of pain I'm feeling broken in my melody As I sing to help the tears go away Then I remember the pledge you made to me I know you're always there To hear my every prayer inside I'm clinging to the promise of a lifetime I hear the words you say To never walk away from me and leave behind The promise of a lifetime Will you help me fall apart Pick me up, take me in your arms Find my way back from the storm And you show me how to grow Through the change I still remember the pledge you made to me I am holding on to the hope I have inside With you I will stay through every day Putting my understanding aside And I am comfortedWhen I wander through the desert And I'm longing for my home All my dreams have gone astray When I'm stranded in the valley And I'm tired and all alone It seems like I've lost my way I go running to Your mountain Where Your mercy sets me free You are my strong tower Shelter over me Beautiful and mighty Everlasting King You are my strong tower Fortress when I'm weak Your name is true and holy And Your face is all I seek In the middle of my darkness In the midst of all my fear You're my refuge and my hope When the storm of life is raging And the thunder's all I hear You speak softly to my soulWe bow our hearts, we bend our knees Oh Spirit, come make us humble We turn our eyes from evil things Oh Lord, we cast down our idols So give us clean hands, give us pure hearts Let
