You look in my eyes And I get emotional inside I know it's crazy but You still can touch my heart And after all this time You'd think that I I wouldn't feel the same But time melts into nothing And nothing's changed I still believe someday you and me Will find ourselves in love again I had a dream someday you and me Will find ourselves in love again Each day of my life I'm filled with all the joy I could find You know that I am not the desperate type If there's one spark of hope left in my grasp I'll hold it with both hands It's worth the risk of burning To have a second chanceIt's a rainy day and I just got to thinking Of how our lives had changed with all the years This room was once alive with all your laughter But when I heard the silence, I called you right away Now please don't say a word, hear what I say Oh, love me like the first time again Let's pretend that's never gonna end For one last night Just hold me in the way you used to do, you know Love me like the first time and go Is it my imagination  Are you lonely Well, I'm sorry, but I thought you sounded sad I'm not tryin' to start a fire again, please listen But if you're free at all tomorrow, the next day, who knows when For the last time can we say goodbye as friends Oh, love me like the first time again Let's pretend that's never gonna end For one last night Just hold me in the way you used to do, you know Love me like the first time and goOoh, yeah What you see is what you get What you get is everything now, honey What you see is what you get Nothing more and nothing less Ooh I been watching your eyes Looking for someone Time after time They met mine, the chase is on You think I'm this You think I'm that I wonder why you stop and go Do you think I'm weak Do you think I'm strong I think I ought to let you know What you see is what you get, baby What you get is everything now, honey What you see is what you get You get nothing more and nothing less, no*Verse1*Yo no se que hacer Me enamore de
