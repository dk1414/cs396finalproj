The distant echo Of faraway voices boarding faraway trains To take them home to The ones that they love and who love them forever The glazed, dirty steps, repeat my own and reflect my thoughts Cold and uninviting, partially naked Except for toffee wrappers and this morning's paper Mr  Jones got run down Headlines of death and sorrow, they tell of tomorrow Madmen on the rampage And I'm down in the tube station at midnight I fumble for change, and pull out the Queen Smiling, beguiling I put in the money and pull out a plum Behind me Whispers in the shadows, gruff blazing voices Hating, waiting"Hey boy" they shout, "have you got any money "And I said, "I've a little money and a takeaway curry I'm on my way home to my wife She'll be lining up the cutlery, you know she's expecting me Polishing the glasses and pulling out the cork"I'm down in the tube station at midnight I first felt a fist, and then a kick I could now smell their breath They smelt of pubs and Wormwood Scrubs And too many right wing meetings My life swam around me It took a look and drowned me in its own existence The smell of brown leather It blended in with the weather Filled my eyes, ears, nose and mouth, it blocked all my senses Couldn't see, hear, speak any longer I'm down in the tube station at midnight I said I was down in the tube station at midnight The last thing that I saw as I lay there on the floor Was "Jesus saves" painted by an atheist nutter And a British rail poster read "have an away day, a cheap holiday Do it today"I glanced back on my life, and thought about my wife'Cause they took the keys, and she'll think it's me I'm down in the tube station at midnight The wine will be flat and the curry's gone cold I'm down in the tube station at midnight Don't want to go down in a tube station at midnight Don't want to go down in a tube station at midnight Don't want to go down in a tube station at midnightBetter stop dreaming of the quiet life'Cos it's the one we'll never know And quit running for that runaway bus'Cos those rosey days are few And...stop apologising for the things you've never done'Cos time is short and life is cruel But it's up to us to change This town called Malice Rows and rows of disused milk floats Stand dying in the dairy yard And a hundred lonely housewives Clutch empty milk bottles to their hearts Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry It's enough to make you stop believing When tears come fast and furious In a town called Malice Ye-eh-eah Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah, oh Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bahSome people might say my life is in a rut I'm quite happy with what I got People might say that I should strive for more But I'm so happy I can't see the point Something's happening here today A show of strength with your boy's brigade And I'm so happy and you're so kind You want more money -
