Part I Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep Enter my chamber you never will leave Festering bodies will cover the streets Satanic prophecies, Christian hypocrisy Bury me deep in the filth and disease Open my mind and then hammer it closed Into the darkness I'm strangled and choked Tracing the patterns and numbers in smoke Blood on my dagger from enemies throats Crucify ghosts in a frozen abyss Ocean of planets in total eclipse Nowhere I wander wherever I drift Using a razor to open my wrists My body is vacant, my soul is enslaved To a hatred as ancient as day and night Ladder

I'mma let the world know what time it is Life on earth is just a death sentence One little thing just leads to the next and...I got some records, cut some samples, made 'em mine I wrote some raps, I had a couple fire lines I dropped a tape, I did a show, I got some shine Never made a lot of money, that's fine I got some records, cut some samples, made 'em mine I wrote some raps, I had a couple fire lines A couple labels asked me if I want to sign But rapping ain't my grind, I just used to like to rhyme I used to like to rhyme when it was other people's lyrics Spitting Raekwon bars to the mirror just to hear if it sounded the same,Dreams of insurmountable fame and valuable chains;Spit so much I drowned before the drought ever came And that's the shit that never leaves you Every line you rhyme leads back to cats that teach you It's see through, right around the time a playa's meat grew Started making beats too Never tried to please you Numerous influences, but that was only clowning dog The future of me pursuing it was nothing I was counting on Seemed too far to go the distance, pitching from the mound I'm on Pissed off, doubted on, thought the map was routed wrong Persistence was a tag along, hit me like an atom bomb So I give it up to those who let us have a job All you rappers stacks is long cause Nina sang the saddest songs Bristol sessions, Smif N' Wesson,
